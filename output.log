Evaluation Prompt: You are an expert semantic evaluator.

Your task: For EACH pair, decide whether the System Answer expresses the SAME essential
meaning as the Gold Answer.

=== HOW TO INTERPRET THE GOLD ANSWER ===
Before judging, ALWAYS normalize the Gold Answer:
  - Remove duplicates or repeated tokens (e.g., 'France France France France' → 'France').
  - If the same meaning is written several different ways, reduce it to one meaning.
  - Treat the Gold Answer as representing a SINGLE intended fact or meaning.

=== WHEN TO MARK 'YES' ===
Mark **Yes** if the System Answer expresses the SAME meaning as the normalized Gold Answer,
even if the System Answer:
  - contains extra explanation
  - adds context or details
  - uses different wording
  - is much longer than the Gold Answer
As long as the key meaning is correct.

=== WHEN TO MARK 'NO' ===
Mark **No** ONLY if the System Answer:
  - contradicts the Gold Answer, OR
  - provides a different fact, OR
  - misses the essential meaning, OR
  - answers a different question.

System Answer: """The minimum you’re required to pay each month is the **minimum payment** set by your lender.  
- It’s usually a small percentage of the remaining balance (often 1 %–3 %) or a fixed dollar amount (e.g., $150/month).  
- The exact figure is printed on every statement or listed in your loan agreement.

Check your latest statement or log into your online banking portal to see the exact minimum. Paying more than that can help you finish the loan sooner and save on interest."""
