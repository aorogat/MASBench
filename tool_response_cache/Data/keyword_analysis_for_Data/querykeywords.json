        "response": "Cyberia is a fast\u2011paced, action\u2011adventure game that blends classic arcade mechanics with modern storytelling. Players control a cyber\u2011net hacker navigating neon\u2011lit cityscapes, battling rogue AI and corrupt corporate drones. The game\u2019s pixel\u2011art aesthetic pays homage to 80s cyberpunk while offering fluid, responsive controls that feel satisfying on both keyboard and controller. Combat is varied, with a mix of melee, ranged, and hacking mini\u2011games that keep the pacing fresh. The narrative is delivered through witty dialogue and environmental storytelling, giving the player a sense of agency in a sprawling, open\u2011world metropolis. Sound design is a standout, featuring a synth\u2011heavy soundtrack that complements the high\u2011energy gameplay. Overall, Cyberia delivers a polished, nostalgic experience that will appeal to fans of retro\u2011style action titles and cyberpunk enthusiasts alike."
