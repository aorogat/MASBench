      "system_answer": [
        "**Thomas Paine’s “The Age of Reason” – its greatest literary contribution**\n\nThe book’s most enduring contribution to literature is the way it **articulated and popularized deist philosophy** in a clear, persuasive, and accessible prose style that challenged the authority of organized religion.  \n\n1. **Ideological Impact** – Paine’s systematic critique of dogma and his defense of reason as the sole guide to morality reshaped Enlightenment discourse. By presenting deism as a coherent, rational worldview, he opened the door for later secular and humanist writers to explore similar themes without the trappings of institutional faith.\n\n2. **Polemical Style** – Written as a series of essays and pamphlets, the book exemplifies the power of the pamphlet form to influence public opinion. Paine’s use of plain language, rhetorical devices, and direct address made complex philosophical arguments accessible to a broad audience, setting a model for political and religious critique that many writers would emulate.\n\n3. **Legacy in Secular Thought** – The book’s arguments laid groundwork for the secularist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Its influence can be traced in the works of later thinkers such as Voltaire, Hume, and even in the rhetoric of the American and French revolutions.\n\nIn short, **“The Age of Reason” is remembered not just for its content but for how it used literary form to advance a radical, rational critique of religion—an approach that has echoed through generations of secular and Enlightenment literature.**"
