      "system_answer": "Hey there! 👋  \nSounds like you’re into superhero flicks that mix action, humor, and a bit of edge—just like *Deadpool* and *Batman Returns*. Here are some lesser‑known gems that fit that vibe:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it’s a good fit |\n|------|------|---------------------|\n| **Kick-Ass** | 2010 | A dark‑comedy superhero movie that’s both over‑the‑top and surprisingly heartfelt. |\n| **The Boys** (TV series) | 2019‑ | If you’re open to a series, it’s a gritty, satirical take on superheroes that’s got a lot of the same irreverence as *Deadpool*. |\n| **The Dark Knight Returns** (animated) | 2012 | A stylized, darker Batman story that’s less mainstream but still iconic. |\n| **The Crow** | 1994 | A brooding, gothic superhero vibe with a strong visual style—think *Batman Returns* meets *The Crow*. |\n| **The Mask** | 1994 | A comedic, supernatural superhero film starring Jim Carrey—full of zany humor and visual gags. |\n| **The Tick** (TV series) | 1994‑ | A goofy, satirical superhero show that’s a cult classic. |\n| **The Adventures of the American Rabbit** | 2015 | A quirky, low‑budget superhero parody that’s surprisingly clever. |\n| **The Last Knight** (Marvel) | 2017 | A lesser‑known Marvel film that blends action with a bit of humor. |\n| **The Dark Knight Rises** (but skip the first two) | 2012 | If you haven’t seen the whole trilogy, the third film has a darker tone and some unexpected twists. |\n| **The Amazing Spider‑Man 2** | 2014 | A more grounded, character‑driven Spider‑Man that’s less flashy than the MCU but still fun. |\n\n### Quick Q for you:\n- Are you looking for movies that lean more into the comedic side (like *Deadpool*), or do you also enjoy the darker, more dramatic superhero stories (like *Batman Returns*)?  \n- Do you prefer big‑budget blockbusters or indie‑style superhero films?\n\nLet me know which direction you’re leaning toward, and I can fine‑tune the list!",
