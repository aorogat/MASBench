This process continued under David's successors, particularly William the Lion, leading to the integration of Norman culture into Scottish life."

This unique architectural style emerged during the period of Arab rule in Sicily, which lasted from the 9th to the 11th centuries, and was later influenced by Norman architecture following the Norman conquest of the island. The resulting style is characterized by a blend of Islamic and Norman elements, featuring intricate decorative motifs, pointed arches, and elaborate tile work. Notable examples of this architectural fusion can be seen in the Palatine Chapel in Palermo and the Cathedral of Monreale, which showcase the rich cultural exchange between the Norman and Arab influences in the region."

      "system_answer": [
        "For your gathering, I recommend baking a unique and refreshing lemon and lavender pound cake, which is perfect for sharing with colleagues. This cake incorporates dried lavender buds for a delightful flavor and aroma, and it’s a great conversation starter. Additionally, you might consider making classic chocolate chip cookies, as they are always a crowd-pleaser. To achieve the perfect chewy texture, ensure you use a combination of brown sugar and granulated sugar, and slightly underbake them for that gooey center. Here’s a quick recipe for the cookies: \n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n- 3/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 2 large eggs\n- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 2 cups chocolate chips\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla until smooth.\n3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.\n4. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually blend this dry mixture into the wet mixture.\n5. Stir in the chocolate chips.\n6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.\n7. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft.\n8. Let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.\n\nFor the lemon and lavender pound cake, remember to balance the flavors with the right amount of lemon zest and juice. Enjoy your gathering!"

This dish can be made in bulk and reheats well.\n\n3. **Kimbap**: Korean rice rolls filled with vegetables, eggs, and your choice of protein. These are great for meal prep as they can be eaten cold or at room temperature.\n\n4. **Chana Masala**: A hearty chickpea curry that is both filling and nutritious. It can be made in large batches and pairs well with rice or naan.\n\n5. **Saag Aloo**: A comforting dish made with potatoes and spinach, seasoned with spices. This can be prepared in advance and stored for easy reheating.\n\n6. **Vegetable Biryani**: A fragrant rice dish cooked with mixed vegetables and spices. It’s perfect for meal prepping as it tastes even better the next day.\n\nTo make your meal prep efficient, consider cooking in bulk, portioning out meals, and using meal planning apps to help organize your grocery shopping.
