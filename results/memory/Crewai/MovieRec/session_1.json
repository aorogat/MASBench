You have a great day!\nSystem: ",
      "system_answer": "The only official film/TV that shows a young Indiana Jones is the TV series **“The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles”** (1992–1993). The feature film **“Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”** (2008) does not depict him as a child; it only shows him as an adult. If you’re looking for a movie that includes a young Indiana, you might want to check out the 1989 film **“Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”**, which has a brief flashback of a young Indy, but the most comprehensive portrayal of a young Indiana is the TV series.",
