The humor is more centered on wordplay, pop‑culture references, and the characters’ personalities. Eddie Murphy voices Donkey, and his performance is widely praised for its energy, comedic timing, and the chemistry he shares with Mike Myers’ Shrek. Most viewers find his contribution to be a highlight of the movie.",
