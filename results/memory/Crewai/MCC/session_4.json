      "question": "can i mine for gold on any public land",
      "system_answer": "No. In the United States, you cannot mine for gold on any public land without obtaining the appropriate permits and rights. Federal lands (managed by agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, or National Park Service) generally allow only prospecting or small-scale, non‑commercial mining under specific regulations, and even that requires permits, fees, and compliance with environmental and safety rules. State lands may have their own rules, but most require a mining claim, a lease, or a special permit. In short, you must secure the proper legal authorization before you can legally mine for gold on public land.",
