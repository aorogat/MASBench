      "question": "Are there restrictions for my disposable card since it does not seem to be working?",
      "system_answer": "Yes, disposable virtual cards have several built‑in restrictions that can cause them to appear “not working.” They can only be used for a single online transaction, cannot be used for in‑store purchases, cash withdrawals, or recurring payments, and are blocked by certain merchants (e.g., gambling, adult content, or high‑risk sites) and in some countries. If your card isn’t working, check that you haven’t exceeded the one‑transaction limit, that the merchant accepts virtual cards, and that the transaction type is allowed.",

      "question": "I'm trying to transfer money to another country. It's just pending and not sending. My account details are correct. Please help me.",
      "system_answer": "If your international transfer is stuck in a “pending” status even though your account details are correct, try the following steps:\n\n1. **Check for Compliance Holds** – Many services place a temporary hold on cross‑border transfers for regulatory checks. Look for any alerts or messages in the app or email that request additional documentation (e.g., proof of identity, source of funds, or a signed transfer form).\n\n2. **Verify Recipient Information** – Double‑check the recipient’s IBAN/SWIFT code, account number, and name. A small typo can keep the transfer pending until corrected.\n\n3. **Confirm Sufficient Funds & Limits** – Ensure you have enough balance to cover the amount plus any fees, and that you haven’t exceeded your daily or weekly transfer limits.\n\n4. **Check Transfer Schedule** – Some transfers are scheduled to process on the next business day, especially if initiated over a weekend or public holiday. Verify the expected processing date in the app.\n\n5. **Review Your Account Status** – Make sure your account is fully verified and not under any temporary restrictions. If your identity verification is incomplete, the transfer may remain pending.\n\n6. **Contact Support** – If none of the above resolves the issue, reach out to customer support via the app’s chat, email, or phone. Provide them with the transfer reference number, the date you initiated the transfer, and any error messages you see.\n\n7. **Check Destination Bank Status** – Occasionally, the recipient’s bank may be experiencing delays or outages. Ask the recipient to confirm receipt or any pending status on their end.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify why the transfer is pending and take the necessary action to complete it.",

      "question": "What do I do if I notice a strange withdrawl in my statement?",
      "system_answer": "If you spot a strange withdrawal on your statement, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify the Transaction** – Check the date, amount, and recipient details. Compare them with any recent purchases or transfers you made.\n\n2. **Check Your Account Activity** – Log into your banking app or online portal and review recent transactions. Look for any authorized payments that might match the withdrawal.\n\n3. **Review Your Security Settings** – Ensure your account password, PIN, and two‑factor authentication are secure. If you suspect a breach, change your credentials immediately.\n\n4. **Contact Your Bank or Card Issuer** – Call the customer service number on the back of your card or use the in‑app chat. Report the unauthorized withdrawal and request a transaction investigation.\n\n5. **Request a Temporary Freeze or Card Replacement** – If you believe the account is compromised, ask the bank to freeze the account or issue a new card while the investigation proceeds.\n\n6. **File a Dispute or Chargeback** – If the withdrawal was a fraudulent card payment, submit a dispute through the bank’s dispute resolution process. Provide any evidence (e.g., receipts, screenshots).\n\n7. **Monitor Your Account** – Keep an eye on your statement for any further unauthorized activity. Set up transaction alerts if available.\n\n8. **Report to Authorities if Needed** – If the amount is significant or you suspect identity theft, file a police report and consider notifying credit bureaus.\n\nBy acting quickly and following these steps, you can protect your funds and help your bank resolve the issue.",

      "system_answer": "If you receive a message asking you to verify your identity, follow these steps to protect yourself and complete the process safely:\n\n1. **Confirm the source** – Make sure the message comes from the official app, website, or customer‑service email of the company (e.g., your bank, payment platform, or service provider). Look for the official domain, logo, and contact details.\n\n2. **Do not click suspicious links** – If the message contains a link, hover over it (on a computer) or tap it carefully (on a phone) to see the real URL. If it looks unfamiliar or uses a shortened link, avoid it.\n\n3. **Log in directly** – Open the company’s app or website yourself (type the URL into your browser or use the official app). Navigate to the “Account” or “Security” section where identity verification is requested.\n\n4. **Follow the on‑screen instructions** – You’ll usually be asked to upload a photo of a government‑issued ID (passport, driver’s licence, or national ID card) and possibly a selfie or a proof‑of‑address document (utility bill, bank statement, etc.).\n\n5. **Use secure upload methods** – Upload documents through the app or the secure portal, not via email or third‑party links. Ensure the connection is HTTPS (look for the lock icon in the browser).\n\n6. **Check for confirmation** – After submitting, you should receive a confirmation email or in‑app notification that your documents are being processed. Some services may take a few hours to a few days to verify.\n\n7. **Keep records** – Save copies of the documents you sent and any confirmation receipts. Note the date and time of submission.\n\n8. **If you suspect fraud** – If the message looks phishing (misspellings, urgent tone, or requests for passwords), report it to the company’s fraud or support team and do not provide any personal information.\n\nBy verifying the authenticity of the message, using the official channels, and securely submitting the required documents, you can safely complete the identity verification process.",

Enter one of these codes on the web login page to bypass the need for a phone.\n\n3. **Use a trusted device** – If you have another device (tablet, laptop, or another phone) that is already logged in or has the app installed, you can use it to generate a new authentication code or to receive a login link.\n\n4. **Request a login link** – Many apps allow you to request a one‑time login link sent to your registered email. Click the link to log in without a phone.\n\n5. **Contact support for recovery** – If none of the above options are available, reach out to customer support. They can verify your identity through alternative methods (e.g., answering security questions, providing a photo ID) and temporarily grant access.\n\n6. **Set up a new phone later** – Once you regain access, consider setting up a new phone or a secondary device for 2FA to avoid future lock‑outs.",

      "question": "why is the exchange rate for a Foreign ATM different",
      "system_answer": "The exchange rate you see on a foreign ATM is usually set by the ATM operator (or the bank that owns the ATM) rather than by your card‑issuing bank. This is called Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC). The operator applies its own rate, which is often less favorable than the inter‑bank rate your card issuer would use, and it may also add a conversion fee. Additionally, the card network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) may charge a foreign‑currency transaction fee, and the ATM may impose a withdrawal fee. Because of these extra charges and the operator’s own rate, the exchange rate you get at a foreign ATM can differ significantly from the rate you would see on your card‑issuer’s statement or in your banking app.",

Inform them that the card is stuck and provide the ATM location.  \n4. **Wait for the card to be released** – The operator may need to manually retrieve it, which can take a few minutes to a few hours.  \n5. **Confirm the transaction status** – Once the card is returned, check your account to ensure the transaction was not processed. If it was, dispute it with your bank.  \n6. **Request a replacement if necessary** – If the card is damaged or cannot be retrieved, ask your bank to issue a new card and cancel the old one.  \n\nBy staying calm, using the proper channels, and allowing the operator time to retrieve the card, you can resolve the issue with minimal disruption.",

The exchange rate you receive is typically the inter‑bank rate (or the rate set by the ATM operator in the case of DCC) plus any standard foreign‑currency transaction fee and ATM withdrawal fee. Some fintech services (e.g., Wise, Revolut) may offer slightly better rates or lower fees for high‑volume users, but traditional banks and card networks do not offer a discount simply for exchanging currencies more often.",

      "question": "I've notice I was charged for withdrawing cash, can you explain why?",
      "system_answer": "When you withdraw cash from an ATM, the fee you see on your statement is usually the result of several charges that can be applied by different parties:\n\n1. **ATM Operator Fee** – The bank or company that owns the ATM often adds a fixed or percentage fee for each withdrawal. This fee is added to the amount you receive and is shown on your statement.\n\n2. **Card‑Network Fee** – Visa, Mastercard, or other card networks may charge a small fee for using their network to process the withdrawal. This fee is typically a percentage of the transaction amount.\n\n3. **Foreign‑Currency Conversion (DCC)** – If you are withdrawing cash in a currency different from your account’s base currency, the ATM operator may use Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC). The operator applies its own exchange rate, which is usually less favorable than the inter‑bank rate your card issuer would use, and may add a conversion fee on top of the ATM fee.\n\n4. **Your Bank’s Service Charge** – Some banks add an additional service fee for ATM withdrawals, especially if the withdrawal is made outside the bank’s own network or if you exceed a certain number of free withdrawals per month.\n\nBecause these fees are added at the point of transaction, they appear as a separate line item on your statement. If you believe the fee is incorrect or unusually high, you can contact your bank or card issuer to review the charge and confirm that it matches the terms of your account agreement.",

      "system_answer": "To identify the issue with your bank card, follow these quick checks:\n\n1. **Check the card’s physical condition** – Look for visible damage, bent edges, or a broken chip. A damaged card often fails at ATMs or point‑of‑sale terminals.\n\n2. **Verify the expiration date** – If the card is past its expiry, it will be rejected by most systems. Order a replacement if needed.\n\n3. **Confirm the PIN is correct** – A wrong PIN will block the card after a few attempts. Reset or retrieve your PIN through your bank’s app or customer service.\n\n4. **Look for a “stuck in ATM” situation** – If the card is physically lodged in an ATM, do not force it out; use the retrieval button or call the ATM operator.\n\n5. **Check for unauthorized transactions** – Review recent statements or app activity. If you see unfamiliar withdrawals or payments, report them immediately to your bank.\n\n6. **Ensure the card is activated** – Some new cards require activation via phone or online. If not activated, the card won’t work.\n\n7. **Contact your bank’s customer service** – Provide them with the card number (last four digits), the error message you see, and any recent activity. They can check the card’s status in their system and advise on the next steps.\n\nBy systematically reviewing these points, you can pinpoint whether the problem is physical damage, expiration, PIN issues, ATM malfunction, or a security concern. If the issue remains unclear, your bank’s support team can perform a detailed investigation and issue a replacement if necessary.",

Provide all relevant documentation (receipts, screenshots, correspondence with the merchant).  \n5. **Monitor Your Account** – After filing the dispute, keep an eye on your statement. The bank will typically credit the disputed amount back to your account within 30–45 days, depending on the card network’s rules.  \n6. **Update Your Payment Information** – If the duplicate charge was due to a processing error, consider updating your card details or using a different payment method for future purchases to avoid recurrence.  \n\nBy following these steps, you can identify the duplicate charge, obtain a refund, and ensure your account remains accurate.",

      "system_answer": "Yes, you can request a second card. Most banks allow you to order an additional card for yourself or a family member. You can usually do this through your online banking portal or by calling customer service. Some banks may charge a small fee for the extra card, and you may need to provide a new address or verify your identity. Once the second card is issued, you can use it just like your primary card. If you need it for a specific purpose (e.g., a spouse or a business expense), let the bank know so they can set the appropriate limits. If you have any questions about eligibility or fees, contact your bank directly.",

      "question": "Why is my card payment showing as pending?",
      "system_answer": "A card payment appears as **pending** when the merchant has authorized the transaction but has not yet captured the funds. This can happen for several reasons:\n\n1. **Merchant processing time** – Many merchants, especially online or in‑store with card‑present systems, first authorize the amount to verify the card and then capture it later (often within 7–30 days).  \n2. **Offline or delayed capture** – If the merchant’s terminal was offline or the transaction was processed offline, the capture may be delayed until the terminal reconnects.  \n3. **Pre‑authorization for services** – Some services (e.g., hotels, car rentals, ride‑share) place a pre‑authorization to hold a potential amount; the final charge is only captured once the service is completed.  \n4. **Technical or network issues** – Temporary network glitches can cause the capture request to be delayed or lost, leaving the payment in a pending state.  \n5. **Regulatory or compliance holds** – In certain cases, the issuer may place a hold for compliance checks, especially for large or suspicious transactions.  \n\nThe pending status will usually resolve automatically once the merchant captures the payment or the hold expires (often within a few days). If the pending status persists beyond the expected timeframe, contact the merchant or your card issuer for clarification.",

In most cases, the duplicate will be reversed automatically within a few business days, but you should contact the merchant or your bank to confirm and request a refund if it hasn’t been resolved.",

Explain that you see a double charge and provide the transaction details (date, amount, reference number). Ask them to investigate and issue a refund for the duplicate.  \n4. **File a dispute with your bank** – If the merchant does not resolve the issue promptly, submit a dispute through your bank’s dispute resolution process. Provide all relevant documentation (receipts, screenshots, correspondence with the merchant).  \n5. **Monitor your account** – After filing the dispute, keep an eye on your statement. The bank will typically credit the disputed amount back to your account within 30–45 days, depending on the card network’s rules.  \n6. **Prevent future duplicates** – If the duplicate charge was due to a processing error, consider updating your card details or using a different payment method for future purchases to avoid recurrence.",

      "question": "I made a mistake when I did a transfer so now what can I do to fix that?",
      "system_answer": "If you made an error when initiating a transfer, follow these steps to correct it:\n\n1. **Check the transfer status** – Log into your app or website and see whether the payment shows as “Pending,” “Completed,” or “Failed.”  \n2. **Cancel if still pending** – If the status is “Pending,” you can usually cancel the transfer directly in the app. Look for a “Cancel” or “Revert” option next to the transaction.  \n3. **Reverse a completed transfer** – If the transfer has already been completed, you’ll need to request a reversal. Contact customer support immediately with the transfer reference number and explain the mistake.  \n4. **Verify recipient details** – Double‑check the IBAN/SWIFT code, account number, and recipient name. If any details are wrong, correct them before attempting a new transfer.  \n5. **Confirm sufficient funds and limits** – Make sure you have enough balance to cover the amount plus any fees, and that you haven’t exceeded daily or weekly limits.  \n6. **Check for compliance holds** – Some services place a temporary hold for regulatory checks. Look for any alerts or emails requesting additional documentation (e.g., proof of identity, source of funds).  \n7. **Ask the recipient to check their bank** – The recipient’s bank might be experiencing delays or outages; confirm they haven’t received any pending status on their end.  \n8. **Contact customer support** – If you can’t cancel or reverse the transfer yourself, reach out via chat, email, or phone. Provide the transfer reference number, initiation date, and a clear description of the mistake.  \n9. **Initiate a new transfer** – Once the original transfer is cancelled or reversed, send a new transfer with the correct details.  \n\nFollowing these steps should help you correct the mistake and ensure the funds reach the intended recipient.",

      "system_answer": "When the app reverts a top‑up, it means the transaction was cancelled and the amount was returned to your card. Common reasons include:\n\n1. **Insufficient funds or card balance** – the card didn’t have enough money to cover the top‑up.  \n2. **Card or issuer restrictions** – the card was blocked for online/international payments, or the issuer flagged the transaction as suspicious.  \n3. **Exceeded top‑up limits** – you hit the daily, weekly, or monthly limit set by the app or by your card.  \n4. **Compliance or regulatory hold** – the transaction was put on hold for verification and then cancelled.  \n5. **Technical or network issues** – a weak connection or app glitch caused the payment to fail and be reversed.  \n\n**What to do next**\n\n- **Check your card balance** and ensure it’s active and has enough funds.  \n- **Verify card details** (number, expiry, CVV, billing address).  \n- **Look at your top‑up limits** in the app’s settings; increase them if possible.  \n- **Review recent activity** in the app to see the status of the reverted top‑up.  \n- **Contact support** with the transaction ID and any error message; they can confirm why the reversal happened and help you retry.",

      "system_answer": "A £1 “Pending” charge is almost always a merchant pre‑authorisation used to verify that your card is active. The merchant authorises the amount, but the actual capture (the real charge) will only happen if they decide to take the money. If they never capture it, the hold will automatically expire after a short period (usually 7 days for most cards).  \n\nBecause the status has stayed “Pending” for two days, you can:\n\n1. **Check the merchant name** on the statement to see who placed the hold.  \n2. **Wait a few more days** – the hold should drop off automatically if the merchant never captures it.  \n3. **If it remains pending** beyond the usual 7‑day window, contact the merchant to ask whether they intend to capture the amount.  \n4. **If the merchant is unresponsive or you suspect a mistake**, reach out to your card issuer or the app’s support team. They can investigate and, if necessary, reverse the pending authorisation.  \n\nIn most cases, the £1 will disappear on its own once the merchant’s hold expires; if it does not, the issuer can cancel the pending transaction and you will not be charged.",

Explain that you see a double charge, provide the transaction details (date, amount, reference number), and ask them to investigate and issue a refund for the duplicate.  \n4. **File a dispute with your bank** – If the restaurant does not resolve the issue promptly, submit a dispute through your bank’s dispute resolution process. Provide all relevant documentation (receipts, screenshots, correspondence with the restaurant).  \n5. **Monitor your account** – After filing the dispute, keep an eye on your statement. The bank will typically credit the disputed amount back to your account within 30–45 days, depending on the card network’s rules.  \n6. **Prevent future duplicates** – If the duplicate was due to a processing error, consider updating your card details or using a different payment method for future purchases to avoid recurrence.",
