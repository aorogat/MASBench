      "question": "Are there restrictions for my disposable card since it does not seem to be working?",
      "system_answer": "Yes, disposable virtual cards have several restrictions that can cause them to appear not to work. They can only be used for a single online transaction, cannot be used for card‑present purchases, cash withdrawals, or recurring payments, and are blocked at merchants that require 3D Secure or other authentication methods. Additionally, they may be limited to certain countries or merchant categories. If your card is not working, check that the merchant and transaction type are supported for disposable cards.",

Most apps mirror the core functionality on the web, allowing you to view accounts, make transactions, and manage settings.  \n2. **Backup Device** – If you have a tablet, laptop, or another smartphone registered with the app, you can log in there. Make sure the device is trusted and has the latest app version.  \n3. **Recovery Codes** – Many apps provide one‑time recovery codes when you set up two‑factor authentication. Store these codes in a secure place; you can use them to log in from a computer or another device.  \n4. **Email or SMS Verification** – Some services allow you to receive a login link or code via email or SMS. Use the link/code to authenticate on a web browser.  \n5. **Customer Support** – If none of the above options work, contact the app’s support team. They can verify your identity through alternative methods (e.g., answering security questions, providing a photo ID) and grant temporary access.  \n\nAlways ensure you’re on the official website or app store to avoid phishing sites.",

      "question": "why is the exchange rate for a Foreign ATM different",
      "system_answer": "The rate you see at a foreign ATM is usually the bank’s own “ATM rate,” which is often a few basis points higher than the inter‑bank rate. Banks add a small markup to cover the cost of providing the service, and the rate can also be affected by the ATM operator’s own fee structure. Additionally, if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion (DCC), it may apply a different rate that includes a conversion fee. Therefore, the exchange rate you get at a foreign ATM is typically slightly worse than the market rate you would see on a currency‑exchange platform.",

      "system_answer": "When you withdraw cash from an ATM, the bank or card issuer may charge a fee for that transaction. This fee can come from several sources:\n\n1. **Bank‑issued fee** – Many banks offer a limited number of free ATM withdrawals each month. Once you exceed that limit, a flat fee (e.g., $2–$5) or a percentage of the withdrawal amount is applied.\n\n2. **ATM operator fee** – If you use an ATM that is not part of your bank’s network, the operator may add its own surcharge (often a flat fee or a small percentage).\n\n3. **Foreign‑ATM fee** – When you withdraw cash abroad, the local ATM operator and your home bank may each add a fee. Some banks also add a currency‑conversion fee if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion (DCC).\n\n4. **Inter‑bank fee** – For certain card types (e.g., debit cards linked to a different bank), an inter‑bank fee may be charged for the transaction.\n\nTo understand the exact charge:\n\n- **Check your bank’s fee schedule** – It’s usually available on the bank’s website or in the account terms.\n- **Review the ATM receipt** – It often lists the fee applied.\n- **Contact customer service** – Provide the transaction ID and ask for a breakdown of the fee.\n\nIf you believe the fee is incorrect, you can dispute it with your bank, but most ATM withdrawal fees are standard and non‑refundable unless the ATM was malfunctioning or the transaction was fraudulent.",

Most banks and card issuers settle withdrawals within **1–3 business days**. If you initiated the withdrawal late in the day or on a weekend, it may wait until the next business day before processing.  \n\nIf the withdrawal remains pending after 3 business days, it could be due to a compliance or regulatory check, a temporary technical issue, or a hold placed by the bank. In that case, check the transaction status in your banking app or online portal, and if it’s still pending, contact your bank’s customer support with the transaction reference number so they can investigate.",

First, many banks allow only a limited number of free withdrawals per month; after that, they charge a flat fee or a percentage of the amount. Second, if you use an ATM that isn’t part of your bank’s network, the operator may add its own surcharge, usually a flat fee or a small percentage. Third, when you withdraw cash abroad, both the local ATM operator and your home bank may add fees, and if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion, a currency‑conversion fee may also apply. Finally, for certain card types, an inter‑bank fee may be charged. To see the exact charge, check your bank’s fee schedule, review the ATM receipt, or contact customer service with the transaction ID. If you believe the fee is incorrect, you can dispute it with your bank.",

      "question": "I payed with a card and was charged an extra fee",
      "system_answer": "When you pay with a card and see an extra fee on your statement, it’s usually one of the following:\n\n1. **Merchant surcharge** – Some merchants add a small fee (often 1–3 %) for card payments, especially for small or online purchases.  \n2. **Foreign‑transaction fee** – If the purchase was made in a currency different from your card’s base currency, your card issuer may charge a 1–3 % fee.  \n3. **Card‑issuer fee** – Certain cards (e.g., some prepaid or business cards) impose a fee for each transaction or for using the card abroad.  \n4. **Processing or gateway fee** – In rare cases, the payment processor may add a fee that is passed on to the customer.\n\n**What to do**\n\n1. **Check the statement** – Look at the merchant name, date, and amount.  \n2. **Review your card agreement** – It will list any applicable fees (surcharge, foreign‑transaction, etc.).  \n3. **Contact the merchant** – Ask if they added a surcharge and request a refund if it was not disclosed.  \n4. **Contact your card issuer** – If it’s a foreign‑transaction or issuer fee, ask for clarification and whether it can be waived or refunded.  \n5. **Dispute if necessary** – If the fee is not justified, file a dispute with your bank, providing the transaction details and any correspondence with the merchant.  \n\nMost banks resolve legitimate disputes within a few business days, and many merchants will refund a surcharge if it was not clearly disclosed at the point of sale.",

      "question": "Hello. I checked my transactions and saw I was double charged on my card for a restaurant visit. I would like to get my money back.",
      "system_answer": "Double‑charging can happen when a merchant processes the same transaction twice, when a payment gateway resubmits a failed authorization, or when a card is used in a split‑payment scenario that records two separate charges. To resolve the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify the transaction details** – Check the date, amount, merchant name, and transaction ID on your statement.  \n2. **Cross‑check your purchase records** – Compare the statement entries with your receipts or order confirmations to confirm a duplicate.  \n3. **Contact the merchant** – Call or email the restaurant’s customer service, provide the transaction IDs, and request a refund for the duplicate charge.  \n4. **If the merchant does not resolve the issue** – Contact your bank or card issuer. Provide the duplicate transaction details and ask for a chargeback or reversal.  \n5. **Monitor your account** – Keep an eye on subsequent statements to confirm the duplicate has been removed and the refund has been posted.  \n\nAct promptly, as most banks can investigate and correct double charges within a few business days.",
