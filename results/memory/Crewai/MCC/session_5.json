It is a building block of proteins and is a precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. In the body, phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase; a deficiency in this enzyme causes phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylalanine is also used in the synthesis of the drug L-DOPA for Parkinson’s disease treatment.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun emits nearly white light, but the Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter‑wavelength (blue) light more efficiently than longer wavelengths. This Rayleigh scattering removes much of the blue component from the sunlight that reaches the surface, leaving a light that appears yellowish to the human eye. Additionally, the Sun’s surface temperature (~5,800 K) produces a spectral peak in the yellow‑green part of the spectrum, reinforcing the yellow appearance.",

It is caused by an aphthovirus of the Picornaviridae family, with seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia1). The disease is characterized by fever, vesicular lesions on the mouth, feet, teats, and hooves, and can lead to lameness, decreased milk production, and reproductive losses. FMD spreads rapidly through direct contact, aerosols, contaminated feed, and fomites. Control measures include vaccination, movement restrictions, culling of infected and exposed animals, and strict biosecurity protocols. The disease has significant economic impacts on livestock production and trade, and outbreaks are monitored and reported to international bodies such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).",

They are typically made from crystalline silicon (monocrystalline or polycrystalline) or thin‑film materials such as amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). When photons strike the semiconductor, they excite electrons, creating electron‑hole pairs that are separated by an internal electric field at a p‑n junction. This separation generates a flow of electrons (current) that can be harnessed as direct current (DC) electricity. Solar cells are assembled into modules and panels to increase power output, and they can be integrated into building materials, portable devices, or large utility‑scale solar farms.",
