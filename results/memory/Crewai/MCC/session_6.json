      "system_answer": "Target heart rate is the specific range of heartbeats per minute (bpm) that an individual aims to maintain during physical activity to achieve a particular fitness goal. It is usually expressed as a percentage of a person's maximum heart rate (MHR), which is commonly estimated by the formula MHR = 220 – age. For example, a moderate-intensity workout might target 50–70 % of MHR, while vigorous exercise could aim for 70–85 % of MHR. Maintaining heart rate within this target zone helps ensure that the exercise is effective for cardiovascular conditioning, calorie burning, or endurance training while staying within safe limits.",

They typically consist of one or more layers of materials such as crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, or thin‑film compounds (e.g., cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide). When photons from sunlight strike the cell, they excite electrons in the semiconductor, creating electron‑hole pairs. An internal electric field—created by doping the semiconductor to form a p‑n junction—drives the electrons toward the n‑type side and the holes toward the p‑type side, generating a flow of current when the cell is connected to an external circuit. Solar cells are the fundamental building blocks of solar panels and are used in a wide range of applications from small portable devices to large utility‑scale power plants.",

The disease is transmitted primarily through contaminated feed containing animal protein, and it can be transmitted to humans as variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD) through consumption of infected beef products. Symptoms in cattle include weight loss, behavioral changes, and ataxia, and the disease is invariably fatal. Control measures focus on strict feed bans, surveillance, and culling of infected or exposed animals.",
