      "question": "what kind of oil do i need for my ford truck and how can i change it",
      "system_answer": "**What oil do I need for my Ford truck?**  \n- **Check the owner’s manual** – it lists the exact viscosity and type.  \n- For most modern Ford pickups (F‑150, Ranger, Super Duty, etc.) the recommended oil is **5W‑20** (or 5W‑30 for older engines or those that run hotter).  \n- Use a **full‑synthetic** or **synthetic‑blend** oil that meets the Ford specification **WSS-M2C172‑X** (or the equivalent for your model year).  \n- If you have a diesel‑powered Ford (e.g., F‑250 Super Duty with a 6.7‑L Power Stroke), use a **diesel engine oil** such as **5W‑30** that meets **Ford 9W‑30** or **WSS‑M2C172‑X**.  \n\n**How to change the oil**  \n1. **Warm up the engine** for a few minutes to let the oil flow.  \n2. **Secure the truck** on a level surface, engage the parking brake, and place wheel chocks.  \n3. **Lift the front** (or rear, if you’re changing the rear‑wheel‑drive oil) with a jack and secure with jack stands.  \n4. **Locate the oil drain plug** under the engine block. Place a drain pan beneath it.  \n5. **Remove the drain plug** with a socket wrench, let the oil drain completely (usually 5–10 min).  \n6. **Replace the drain plug** and tighten to the manufacturer’s torque spec (typically 20–25 ft‑lb).  \n7. **Remove the oil filter** with an oil filter wrench; let the remaining oil drain.  \n8. **Install a new filter** – apply a small amount of new oil to the rubber seal, hand‑tighten, then give an additional ¾ turn.  \n9. **Add new oil** – open the hood, locate the oil filler cap, and pour the recommended amount (check the dipstick for the exact volume).  \n10. **Start the engine** and let it run for a minute; check for leaks around the drain plug and filter.  \n11. **Turn off the engine** and wait a few minutes for the oil to settle.  \n12. **Check the oil level** with the dipstick, add more if needed, then replace the cap.  \n13. **Dispose of the old oil** properly – take it to a recycling center or auto shop that accepts used oil.  \n\n**Quick tips**  \n- Use a **new oil filter** each time you change oil.  \n- Keep a **log** of oil changes (date, mileage, oil type).  \n- If you’re unsure about the exact oil spec, call a Ford dealer or look up your VIN on Ford’s website.  \n\nThis procedure will keep your Ford truck’s engine lubricated, running smoothly, and help maintain warranty coverage.",

      "system_answer": "**How to Change the Oil on a Typical Passenger Car**  \n\n1. **Prepare**  \n   - Read your owner’s manual for the correct oil viscosity and filter type.  \n   - Gather supplies: new oil (usually 5W‑20, 5W‑30, or 10W‑30 depending on your engine), a new oil filter, a socket wrench, an oil filter wrench, a drain pan, a funnel, and a jack with jack stands.  \n\n2. **Warm the Engine**  \n   - Run the engine for a few minutes so the oil is warm and flows easily.  \n\n3. **Secure the Vehicle**  \n   - Park on a level surface, engage the parking brake, and place wheel chocks behind the wheels.  \n\n4. **Lift the Car**  \n   - Use the jack to lift the front (or rear, if applicable) and secure with jack stands.  \n\n5. **Drain Old Oil**  \n   - Position the drain pan under the oil drain plug.  \n   - Remove the plug with a socket wrench and let the oil drain completely (5–10 min).  \n\n6. **Replace the Drain Plug**  \n   - Reinstall the plug and tighten to the manufacturer’s torque spec (usually 20–25 ft‑lb).  \n\n7. **Change the Oil Filter**  \n   - Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old filter.  \n   - Lubricate the rubber seal of the new filter with a little fresh oil, install it by hand, then give an additional ¾ turn.  \n\n8. **Add New Oil**  \n   - Open the hood, locate the oil filler cap, and pour the recommended amount of new oil using a funnel.  \n\n9. **Check for Leaks**  \n   - Start the engine, let it run for a minute, then check around the drain plug and filter for leaks.  \n\n10. **Verify Oil Level**  \n    - Turn off the engine, wait a few minutes, then pull the dipstick, wipe it clean, reinsert, and pull again to check the level. Add more oil if needed.  \n\n11. **Dispose of Old Oil**  \n    - Transfer the used oil to a sealed container and take it to a recycling center or auto shop that accepts used oil.  \n\n**Quick Tips**  \n- Use a new oil filter each time.  \n- Keep a log of oil changes (date, mileage, oil type).  \n- If unsure about the oil spec, check the owner’s manual, the fuel door label, or your VIN on the manufacturer’s website.  \n\nFollowing these steps will keep your engine lubricated, running smoothly, and help maintain warranty coverage.",

Redeem before the deadline to avoid loss.\n\n**Quick Tips**  \n- **Value**: Cash or statement credit typically offers 1 cent per point.  \n- **Avoid Fees**: Some issuers charge a small fee for cash transfers; check the terms.  \n- **Combine with Other Offers**: Use points for cash while also taking advantage of bonus categories or promotional matches for maximum value.",

      "system_answer": "**Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients**  \n- 4 boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts  \n- 4 slices Swiss cheese (or Gruyère)  \n- 4 slices cooked ham (thinly sliced)  \n- 1 cup all‑purpose flour, for dredging  \n- 2 large eggs, beaten  \n- 1 cup breadcrumbs (panko or regular)  \n- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  \n- 1 tsp dried thyme  \n- 1 tsp garlic powder  \n- Salt and pepper, to taste  \n- 2 tbsp olive oil  \n- 2 tbsp butter  \n- 1 cup chicken broth  \n- 1/2 cup heavy cream  \n- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard  \n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**Instructions**  \n\n1. **Prepare the chicken**  \n   - Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4‑inch thick.  \n   - Season both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried thyme.\n\n2. **Assemble the roulades**  \n   - On each flattened breast, lay one slice of ham and one slice of cheese.  \n   - Roll the breast tightly, securing with a toothpick or kitchen twine if desired.\n\n3. **Dredge the roulades**  \n   - Set up three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with a mixture of breadcrumbs, Parmesan, and a pinch of salt.  \n   - Coat each chicken roll first in flour, shaking off excess, then dip in egg, and finally coat with the breadcrumb mixture.\n\n4. **Sear the chicken**  \n   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil and butter over medium‑high heat.  \n   - Add the chicken rolls and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 3–4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.\n\n5. **Make the sauce**  \n   - In the same skillet, pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits.  \n   - Stir in the heavy cream and Dijon mustard, bringing to a gentle simmer.  \n   - Let the sauce reduce slightly, about 3–4 minutes, until it thickens a bit.\n\n6. **Finish and serve**  \n   - Return the chicken rolls to the skillet, spooning sauce over them.  \n   - Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).  \n   - Remove toothpicks or twine, slice the roulades into rounds if desired, and drizzle with the sauce.  \n   - Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately with your choice of sides (e.g., mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a fresh salad).",
