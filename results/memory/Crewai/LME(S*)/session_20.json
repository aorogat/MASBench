      "system_answer": "Your bike may feel better on Sunday group rides because you’ve had a rest day (or a lighter training load) during the week, allowing your muscles and the bike’s components to recover. Additionally, riding with a group can motivate you to maintain a steadier pace and use the bike more efficiently, which can translate into a smoother, more responsive ride.",

They might prefer explanations that connect these details to the observed improvement in bike performance.
