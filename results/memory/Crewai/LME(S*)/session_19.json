      "system_answer": "- **Brown the meat first**: Searing adds flavor and helps retain juices.  \n- **Use the right cuts**: Tougher cuts (chuck, round, brisket) become tender; avoid lean cuts that dry out.  \n- **Don’t overfill**: Leave at least 1–2 inches of headspace; the cooker expands as food cooks.  \n- **Add liquids gradually**: Start with the minimum required, then add more if needed; too much liquid can dilute flavors.  \n- **Layer wisely**: Place root vegetables on top of meat so they don’t overcook; add delicate greens last.  \n- **Season in stages**: Add salt and spices at the beginning for depth, then finish with fresh herbs or acid (lemon, vinegar) at the end to brighten.  \n- **Use a timer**: Even on low, set a timer for 6–8 hours; most slow cookers have a “keep warm” mode that can be used for longer cooking.  \n- **Avoid frequent opening**: Each opening releases heat and lengthens cooking time; only open at the end to check doneness.  \n- **Check for doneness**: Use a meat thermometer (145°F for pork, 165°F for poultry) or test tenderness with a fork.  \n- **Finish with a quick sear**: For a crisp exterior, sear the cooked meat in a hot pan for a minute on each side before serving.  \n- **Experiment with ratios**: Try a 3:1 liquid-to-solid ratio for stews; adjust based on desired thickness.  \n- **Use a slow cooker liner**: Makes cleanup easier and prevents sticking.  \n- **Keep a recipe log**: Note adjustments (time, liquid, seasoning) to refine future dishes.",
