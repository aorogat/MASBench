      "system_answer": "- Pick a park that matches your interests (e.g., thrill rides, family-friendly, water parks, or a specific franchise theme).  \n- Check the park’s official website for operating hours, special events, and any seasonal closures.  \n- Look up the most popular rides and create a priority list; consider using a fast pass or single rider line if available.  \n- Plan a rough itinerary: start with the biggest attractions early in the day, then move to shows or parades, and finish with a relaxed ride or a scenic walk.  \n- Pack essentials: comfortable shoes, sunscreen, a refillable water bottle, a light jacket (weather can change), and a small backpack for snacks.  \n- Bring a portable phone charger and a printed map or download the park’s app for real-time wait times and show schedules.  \n- Schedule a meal break around the park’s peak lunch hour (usually 12–1 pm) to avoid long lines; consider dining reservations if the park offers them.  \n- If the park has a water park or a special attraction, allocate a separate day or a specific time slot to avoid crowd overlap.  \n- Keep an eye on weather forecasts; bring rain gear if rain is expected.  \n- Capture memories: take photos or short videos, but also set aside time to enjoy the experience without a camera.  \n- After the park, consider a nearby restaurant or a local attraction to extend the weekend fun.",

The user might not prefer suggestions that focus solely on one aspect of theme parks, such as only thrill rides or only family-friendly attractions, and may not be interested in parks that lack special events or unique dining options.",
