      "system_answer": "- **Use the subway and JR lines**: Tokyo’s extensive metro network (Tokyo Metro, Toei Subway) and JR lines (Yamanote, Chuo, Keihin‑Tōhoku) cover almost every major district. A prepaid IC card (Suica, Pasmo, ICOCA) works on all trains, buses, and even some taxis, and you can top it up at stations.  \n- **Plan with navigation apps**: Google Maps, Citymapper, or the official Tokyo Metro app give real‑time train times, platform changes, and walking directions.  \n- **Avoid rush hour**: Trains are most crowded between 7–9 am and 5–7 pm. If possible, travel a bit earlier or later to enjoy a smoother ride.  \n- **Buses for short hops**: In areas where trains don’t reach (e.g., some parks or residential neighborhoods), local buses are handy. IC cards work on most buses, and the bus apps show live arrival times.  \n- **Taxis for convenience**: Taxis are plentiful but can be expensive, especially during peak times or late at night. Use a ride‑hailing app (Uber, JapanTaxi) to get a fare estimate and avoid language barriers.  \n- **Walking and cycling**: Many neighborhoods (Shibuya, Harajuku, Asakusa) are pedestrian‑friendly. Consider renting a bike (e.g., Docomo Bike Share) for short distances.  \n- **Etiquette**: Keep your voice low on trains, stand on the right side of escalators, and let passengers exit before you board.  \n- **Stay connected**: A pocket Wi‑Fi or a local SIM card keeps you updated on schedules and navigation.  \n\nThese tips should help you navigate Tokyo smoothly and reduce anxiety about getting around.",
