Additionally, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is another powerful war film that showcases bravery and conviction. If you're looking for more classic war films, \"Ice Cold in Alex\" (1958) and \"Battle of Britain\" (1969) are excellent choices for a Sunday afternoon marathon. Lastly, \"The Hurt Locker\" (2008) is a gripping drama that explores the psychological effects of war. Enjoy your movie watching!"

Another excellent choice is \"Zodiac\" (2007), which delves into the real-life hunt for the Zodiac Killer in San Francisco during the late 1960s and 1970s. If you haven't seen \"Prisoners\" (2013), it's a tense and emotional film about a father's desperate search for his missing daughter. These films should satisfy your craving for a good crime story!"

        "Based on your interest in detective movies like \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009) and your enjoyment of \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (2017), I recommend \"Prisoners\" (2013), which is a gripping thriller about a father's desperate search for his missing daughter. Additionally, \"Zodiac\" (2007) is an excellent choice, as it follows the real-life investigation of the Zodiac Killer in San Francisco. If you're looking for something classic, \"Se7en\" (1995) is a must-see, featuring two detectives on the trail of a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi. These films should provide you with a thrilling experience!"

        "If you enjoyed The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004), you might also like other films directed by Wes Anderson, such as The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Rushmore (1998). Both films share Anderson's unique style and humor, making them great companions to The Life Aquatic. Additionally, if you're a fan of Bill Murray, you might want to check out his performances in classics like What About Bob? (1991) and Stripes (1981), which are also highly regarded comedies. Enjoy your movie marathon!"

        "Shrek (2001) is a delightful animated film that features humor suitable for all ages, with a good balance of jokes, including some light-hearted ones. While it does have a few fart jokes, they are not overwhelming and are part of the film's charm. Eddie Murphy, who voices Donkey, delivers a memorable performance that adds to the film's appeal. Overall, it's a fun choice that should satisfy your desire for something light-hearted without being overly crude. Enjoy your movie night!"

      "system_answer": [
        "If you love David Lynch's \"Eraserhead\" (1977), I recommend checking out \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), also directed by Lynch, which explores themes of isolation and societal rejection. Another great film is \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), which features Lynch's signature surreal storytelling and complex narrative structure. For something outside of Lynch's work, consider \"Tetsuo: The Iron Man\" (1989), a Japanese cyberpunk film that shares a similar unsettling atmosphere and avant-garde style. These films should resonate well with your appreciation for Lynch's unique cinematic vision."

This can occur for several reasons: the merchant may not have completed the transaction on their end, or the payment processor may still be verifying the transaction. Additionally, pending transfers can happen if there are holds placed by the bank for security reasons or if the transaction is being processed during non-business hours. It's important to note that pending transactions can take a few hours to a few days to clear, depending on the merchant and the bank's processing times. If the pending status persists for an unusually long time, it is advisable to contact your bank or the merchant for further clarification."

Generally, cash withdrawals can take anywhere from a few minutes to several business days to reflect in your account. If the withdrawal is through a bank transfer, it may take 1-3 business days for the funds to appear. For instant payment services, the cash withdrawal may be processed immediately or within a few hours. If you are experiencing a delay, check for any notifications from your service provider regarding processing times or issues. Additionally, ensure that the transaction was successfully initiated and that there are no holds or limits affecting the withdrawal. If the pending status persists for an unusually long time, it is advisable to contact customer support for your payment service to get specific information about the status of your transaction."

      "system_answer": [
        "A pound charge that remains in a \"Pending\" status for an extended period, such as two days, typically indicates that the transaction has been authorized but not yet fully processed. This can occur for several reasons: the merchant may not have finalized the transaction, or the payment processor might still be verifying it. Additionally, pending charges can result from holds placed by the bank for security reasons or if the transaction is being processed during non-business hours. Generally, pending transactions can take a few hours to a few days to clear, depending on the merchant and the bank's processing times. If the pending status continues for an unusually long time, it is advisable to contact your bank or the merchant for further clarification."

        "Typically, you have three attempts to enter your PIN correctly before your card is blocked for security reasons. After three incorrect attempts, the card may be temporarily disabled, and you will need to contact your bank to unlock it or reset your PIN. If you are experiencing issues with your bank card, it could be due to several reasons. For instance, if you can't get cash out of the ATM, your card may be broken or there could be a problem with the ATM itself. Additionally, if your card was declined during a purchase, it might be due to insufficient funds, a blocked card, or a technical issue with the payment system. If you suspect your card has been compromised, it's crucial to contact your bank immediately to freeze your card and investigate any unauthorized transactions. Always ensure that your PIN hasn't been blocked due to multiple incorrect entries, as this can also prevent card usage."

Commonly, this can occur if you used an ATM that is not part of your bank's network, as many banks impose fees for using out-of-network ATMs. Additionally, some banks charge a fee for cash withdrawals, especially if you exceed a certain number of free withdrawals per month. It's also possible that foreign transaction fees apply if you withdrew cash in a different currency. To get a precise explanation, I recommend checking your bank's fee schedule or contacting customer service for clarification on the specific charge."
