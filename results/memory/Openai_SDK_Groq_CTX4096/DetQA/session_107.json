Misty Sketches\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative surrounding the twins, the only character explicitly credited with composing a heartfelt note of congratulations and best wishes is Misty Sketches. The other options—Itoh, Kan Yen, and McCartney—are mentioned in unrelated contexts (a surname, a pseudonym, and a famous musician, respectively) and have no documented involvement in writing the twins’ letter. Therefore, Misty Sketches is the correct answer.\"}",
