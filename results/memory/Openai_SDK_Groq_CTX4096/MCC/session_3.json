      "question": "what kind of oil do i need for my ford truck and how can i change it",
      "system_answer": "### 1.  What oil do you need?\n\n| **Ford truck model** | **Typical engine** | **Recommended oil** | **Why it matters** |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| **F‑150 (2015‑2023)** | 3.5 L V6, 5.0 L V8, 3.5 L EcoBoost V6, 5.0 L EcoBoost V8 | **5W‑20** (for 3.5 L V6 & 5.0 L V8) <br>**5W‑30** (for EcoBoost engines) | Keeps the engine cool, reduces wear, and meets Ford’s specifications. |\n| **F‑150 (2005‑2014)** | 4.6 L V8, 5.4 L V8 | **5W‑20** (4.6 L) <br>**5W‑30** (5.4 L) | Same reasoning—optimal viscosity for the engine’s operating temps. |\n| **Ranger (2019‑2023)** | 2.3 L EcoBoost, 3.0 L EcoBoost | **5W‑20** (2.3 L) <br>**5W‑30** (3.0 L) | Keeps the turbocharged engines running smoothly. |\n| **F‑150 (2000‑2004)** | 4.2 L V6, 4.6 L V8 | **5W‑20** (4.2 L) <br>**5W‑30** (4.6 L) | Older engines still use these viscosities. |\n\n> **Tip:**  \n> • **Check the owner’s manual** – it lists the exact oil grade and any special requirements (e.g., “Ford 0W‑20” for newer EcoBoost engines).  \n> • **Look for the “Ford 0W‑20” or “Ford 5W‑20” label** on the oil cap or in the manual.  \n> • If you’re unsure, a quick call to a Ford dealer or a quick online search with your exact VIN will confirm the exact oil.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How to change the oil (step‑by‑step)\n\n> **Tools you’ll need**  \n> • Oil filter wrench (or a socket set)  \n> • Drain pan (big enough for the oil)  \n> • Funnel  \n> • New oil filter (same brand/size as the old one)  \n> • New oil (quantity depends on engine; see below)  \n> • Jack & jack stands or ramps (if you need to lift the truck)  \n> • Gloves & safety glasses (optional but recommended)\n\n#### Step 1: Prepare the truck\n1. **Warm up the engine** for a few minutes (this helps the oil drain out smoothly).  \n2. **Park on a level surface** and engage the parking brake.  \n3. **Turn off the engine** and let it cool a bit (but not fully, otherwise the oil will be too thick).  \n4. **Lift the front of the truck** (if needed) using a jack and secure it on jack stands or drive it onto ramps.  \n5. **Locate the oil drain plug** (usually on the bottom of the oil pan) and the oil filter (often on the side of the engine block).\n\n#### Step 2: Drain the old oil\n1. Place the drain pan under the drain plug.  \n2. **Remove the drain plug** with a wrench or socket.  \n3. Let the oil drain completely (this can take 5–10 minutes).  \n4. **Replace the drain plug** once the oil has stopped dripping. Tighten it snugly but don’t over‑tighten (about 3/4‑turn after hand‑tight).\n\n#### Step 3: Replace the oil filter\n1. **Loosen the old filter** with an oil filter wrench (turn counter‑clockwise).  \n2. **Remove the filter** – it will still have oil in it, so keep the drain pan handy.  \n3. **Prepare the new filter**: lightly oil the rubber gasket on the new filter’s outer ring.  \n4. **Install the new filter** by hand (turn clockwise until snug). Tighten an additional 1/4‑turn with the wrench (do not overtighten).\n\n#### Step 4: Add fresh oil\n1. **Check the oil capacity** for your engine (usually 5–7 quarts for most Ford trucks).  \n2. **Open the oil filler cap** on top of the engine.  \n3. **Pour in the new oil** using a funnel.  \n4. **Replace the filler cap** and start the engine.  \n5. **Let the engine run for a minute** to circulate the new oil.  \n6. **Check the oil level** with the dipstick (pull it out, wipe it clean, re‑insert, then pull out again). The oil should be between the “MIN” and “MAX” marks. Add more oil if needed.\n\n#### Step 5: Final checks\n1. **Look for leaks** around the drain plug and filter.  \n2. **Dispose of the old oil** properly – most auto parts stores or service centers accept used oil for recycling.  \n3. **Record the date and mileage** of the oil change in your maintenance log.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Quick reference: Oil quantity by engine\n\n| Engine | Approx. oil capacity |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| 3.5 L V6 | 5 quarts (4.7 L) |\n| 5.0 L V8 | 6 quarts (5.7 L) |\n| 5.4 L V8 | 6 quarts (5.7 L) |\n| 3.0 L EcoBoost | 5 quarts (4.7 L) |\n| 2.3 L EcoBoost | 4 quarts (3.8 L) |\n\n> **Pro tip:** If you’re doing the change yourself, keep a small container of the old oil in the truck. If you’re ever in a hurry, you can use that to top off the oil level later.\n\n---\n\n**Need more help?**  \n- If you’re not comfortable lifting the truck or don’t have the right tools, most Ford dealers or quick‑service shops can do the oil change for you.  \n- If you’re unsure about the exact oil grade for your specific model/year, just let me know the VIN or the exact year and model, and I’ll pull up the exact spec for you.",

      "system_answer": "### Как самостоятельно поменять масло в автомобиле (шаг‑за‑шаг)\n\n> **Важно**: перед началом работы убедитесь, что у вас есть все необходимые инструменты и материалы, а также что вы знаете точный тип и объём масла, подходящий для вашего двигателя. Информацию можно найти в руководстве пользователя или на наклейке под капотом.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Что понадобится\n\n| Инструмент / материал | Зачем |\n|------------------------|-------|\n| **Новый фильтр** (с учётом модели двигателя) | Заменить старый, чтобы предотвратить попадание загрязнений |\n| **Новый моторное масло** (объём и вязкость) | Очистить и смазать двигатель |\n| **Ключ для сливного пробка** (обычно 10‑12 мм) | Снять сливной пробок |\n| **Ключ для фильтра** (или обычный гаечный ключ) | Снять старый фильтр |\n| **Панель для слива масла** (или большой контейнер) | Собрать старое масло |\n| **Фильтр‑вакуум** (необязательно) | Упрощает снятие фильтра |\n| **Фуникул** | Вылить новое масло |\n| **Ключ для крышки масляного бачка** | Открыть крышку для заливки |\n| **Перчатки и очки** | Защита от масла и грязи |\n| **Термометр** (необязательно) | Проверить температуру двигателя перед работой |\n| **Мешок для утилизации масла** | Правильная утилизация старого масла |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Подготовка\n\n1. **Разогрейте двигатель** 5–10 минут, чтобы масло стало более текучим.  \n2. **Остановите автомобиль** и включите ручной тормоз.  \n3. **Поставьте автомобиль на ровную поверхность** (если нужно, поднимите переднюю часть с помощью домкратов и установите подставки).  \n4. **Проверьте температуру двигателя** – если он горячий, подождите, пока масло немного остынет, чтобы избежать ожогов.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Слив старого масла\n\n1. **Разместите сливную панель** под сливным пробком (обычно находится в нижней части масляного поддона).  \n2. **Снимите сливной пробок** с помощью ключа.  \n3. **Дайте маслу полностью стечь** (это может занять 5–10 минут).  \n4. **Установите новый пробок** и затяните его до ¾‑обращения (не переусердствуйте, чтобы не повредить резьбу).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Замена фильтра\n\n1. **Снимите старый фильтр** с помощью ключа для фильтра.  \n2. **Проверьте уплотнительную резинку** на новом фильтре – слегка смазать её небольшим количеством нового масла.  \n3. **Установите новый фильтр** вручную, пока он не будет плотно прилегать, затем затяните ещё ¼‑обращения.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Заливка нового масла\n\n1. **Откройте крышку масляного бачка** (обычно на верхней части двигателя).  \n2. **Вылейте новое масло** через фуникул, следя за тем, чтобы не перелить.  \n3. **Проверьте объём**: откройте щуп, вытяните его, очистите, вставьте обратно и снова вытяните. Масло должно находиться между отметками «MIN» и «MAX». Если нужно, добавьте небольшое количество.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Проверка и финальные шаги\n\n1. **Запустите двигатель** и дайте ему поработать 2–3 минуты, чтобы масло распределилось по всем компонентам.  \n2. **Проверьте наличие утечек** вокруг сливного пробка и фильтра.  \n3. **Проверьте уровень масла** снова через щуп.  \n4. **Утилизируйте старое масло**: возьмите его в специальные пункты приёма (автосервисы, станции технического обслуживания, магазины автозапчастей).  \n5. **Запишите дату и пробег** в журнал обслуживания, чтобы знать, когда нужно делать следующую замену.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Быстрый чек‑лист\n\n- [ ] Разогреть двигатель  \n- [ ] Поднять автомобиль (если нужно)  \n- [ ] Снять сливной пробок → слить масло  \n- [ ] Снять старый фильтр → установить новый  \n- [ ] Залить новое масло → проверить уровень  \n- [ ] Запустить двигатель → проверить утечки  \n- [ ] Утилизировать старое масло  \n- [ ] Записать данные в журнал\n\n---\n\n### Полезные советы\n\n- **Не переутяжайте сливной пробок** – это может повредить резьбу.  \n- **Проверяйте тип масла** в руководстве: для современных двигателей часто требуется синтетическое масло 5W‑30 или 0W‑20.  \n- **Соблюдайте правила утилизации**: старое масло нельзя просто выбрасывать в канализацию.  \n- **Если не уверены** в своих навыках, лучше обратиться в сервисный центр – это экономит время и деньги, если что‑то пойдёт не так.\n\nЕсли у вас есть конкретный марка/модель автомобиля, дайте знать, и я уточню объём масла и тип фильтра, подходящий именно для него. 🚗🛠️",

If your device has a different plug (e.g., US Type A/B, EU Type C/E/F), you’ll need an adapter.\n2. **Voltage** – UK mains is **230 V**. Most modern electronics (phones, laptops, cameras) are dual‑voltage (100–240 V) and will work without a voltage converter. Check the label on your device.\n3. **Frequency** – UK operates at **50 Hz**. Most consumer electronics are frequency‑agnostic, but some specialized equipment (e.g., certain power tools, medical devices) may need a frequency converter.\n4. **Safety** – UK sockets have a built‑in fuse (13 A). If you’re using a high‑power appliance (e.g., hair dryer, iron), ensure the plug is rated for the appliance’s current draw.\n5. **Adapters** – A simple **Type G to Type C/E/F** adapter is enough for most travelers. For high‑power devices, use a dedicated UK plug or a power strip with a UK plug.\n\n#### Quick reference for common travelers\n\n| Device | Typical plug | UK compatibility | Adapter needed? |\n|--------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Phone charger | Type C | Yes (if dual‑voltage) | No |\n| Laptop charger | Type C or Type E/F | Yes (if dual‑voltage) | No |\n| Hair dryer | Type C | Yes (if dual‑voltage) | No |\n| US appliance (Type A/B) | Type A/B | No | Yes (Type G adapter) |\n| European appliance (Type C/E/F) | Type C/E/F | Yes | No (just plug in) |\n\n#### Quick safety checklist\n\n- **Check voltage rating** on your device (usually on the charger or in the manual).  \n- **Use a fused plug** for high‑current appliances.  \n- **Avoid overloading** sockets – don’t plug too many high‑power devices into a single outlet.  \n- **Keep plugs dry** – never use a plug in wet conditions.  \n\nThat’s the rundown of what plugs you’ll encounter in England.

Decide on the new limit\n- **Why you want a change?**  \n  - Need more purchasing power?  \n  - Want to reduce credit utilization?  \n  - Planning a big purchase?  \n- **Set a realistic target** (e.g., increase from £5,000 to £7,500).  \n- Keep in mind that banks often approve increases in increments (e.g., 10–20 % of the current limit).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Gather supporting documents (if required)\n- **Proof of income** (pay slips, tax returns, or a recent bank statement).  \n- **Recent credit score** (if you have one).  \n- **Any other documentation** the bank may ask for (e.g., proof of address).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Request the limit change\n\n| Method | How to do it | Typical response time |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| **Online banking** | • Log in → Credit Card → “Request Credit Limit Increase” (or similar). <br>• Enter desired amount and submit. | 24 h–48 h (often instant if automated). |\n| **Mobile app** | Same as online, but via the app’s “Credit Card” section. | 24 h–48 h. |\n| **Phone** | Call the customer‑service number on the back of your card. <br>• Ask to speak with a credit specialist. <br>• Provide your account details and desired limit. | 1–2 days (depends on the bank’s processing). |\n| **In‑branch** | Visit a local branch, speak with a teller or credit officer. <br>• Bring ID and any supporting docs. | Same day or next business day. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. What the bank will consider\n- **Credit score** (higher scores usually get higher limits).  \n- **Payment history** (on‑time payments, no late fees).  \n- **Income vs. debt ratio** (how much you earn relative to what you owe).  \n- **Existing credit utilization** (lower utilization can help).  \n- **Recent credit inquiries** (multiple recent requests can be a red flag).\n\n---\n\n## 6. After the request\n- **Confirmation**: You’ll receive an email, SMS, or a notification in the app once the limit is approved or declined.  \n- **If approved**: The new limit will be reflected in your account within 24–48 h.  \n- **If declined**: The bank will usually explain why (e.g., insufficient income, high utilization). You can ask for a review or try again after improving your credit profile.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Tips for a higher chance of approval\n1. **Keep your credit utilization below 30 %** before requesting an increase.  \n2. **Pay all balances on time** (no missed or late payments).  \n3. **Show steady income** (provide recent pay slips or a bank statement).  \n4. **Avoid opening many new credit lines** right before the request.  \n5. **Check your credit report** for errors and dispute any inaccuracies.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist before you call or log in\n\n- [ ] Current credit limit noted.  \n- [ ] Desired new limit decided.  \n- [ ] Recent pay slips or income proof ready.  \n- [ ] Credit score (if you know it).  \n- [ ] Phone number or online login credentials handy.\n\n---\n\nIf you let me know which bank or card issuer you’re dealing with, I can give you the exact phone number or link to the online request page. Otherwise, the steps above should guide you through the process. Let me know if you need anything else!",

Most devices automatically show the local time for your time zone. |\n| **Web search** | Type “current time in London” into Google, Bing, or another search engine. The result box will display the time. |\n| **World clock** | Use a world‑clock widget or app (e.g., on iOS, Android, or Windows).

      "question": "i think my luggage is stolen",
      "system_answer": "I’m really sorry to hear that. Here’s a quick action plan you can follow right away:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Check the Airport/Luggage Area First**\n| Step | What to Do | Why |\n|------|------------|-----|\n| **Go to the Lost & Found desk** | Most airports have a dedicated desk or kiosk. | They’ll have a database of reported lost bags. |\n| **Ask the airline’s baggage service** | Provide your flight number, baggage claim tag, and any identifying details (color, tags, stickers). | Airlines keep a record of all checked bags and can track where yours was last seen. |\n| **Check the baggage claim carousel** | Sometimes bags are delayed or mis‑delivered. | A quick scan can save time. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. **File a Formal Report**\n| Where | How |\n|-------|-----|\n| **Airline** | Call the airline’s customer service (usually 24/7) or use their online “Lost Baggage” form. |\n| **Airport** | If you’re still at the airport, fill out a “Lost Baggage” form at the Lost & Found desk. |\n| **Police** | If you suspect theft (e.g., bag was opened, items missing), file a police report. Bring your boarding pass, baggage claim tag, and any evidence (photos, receipts). |\n\n**Tip:** Keep a copy of every report and the reference number. You’ll need it for insurance claims.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Contact Your Travel Insurance (or Credit Card)**\n| What to Do | Why |\n|------------|-----|\n| **Check coverage** | Many travel insurance policies cover lost, stolen, or delayed baggage. |\n| **File a claim** | Provide the airline’s claim number, police report, and a list of missing items with approximate values. |\n| **Ask about reimbursement limits** | Some policies cap the amount per item or per trip. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Secure Your Essentials**\n| Item | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **Cash & cards** | Report lost cards immediately. |\n| **Personal documents** | If passports or IDs are missing, contact your embassy/consulate. |\n| **Valuables** | If you had electronics or jewelry, consider filing a separate police report. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Follow Up**\n| When | What to Do |\n|------|------------|\n| **24–48 h** | Call the airline to check the status of your claim. |\n| **1–2 weeks** | If the bag hasn’t been located, ask for a “final” status and any next steps. |\n| **Insurance** | Keep all receipts for replacement items; you’ll need them for reimbursement. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Prevent Future Loss**\n| Tip | How |\n|-----|-----|\n| **Use a unique luggage tag** | Attach a tag with your name, phone number, and a photo of the bag. |\n| **Label inside the bag** | Write your contact info on a piece of tape inside the suitcase. |\n| **Keep a list of contents** | A quick inventory helps when filing a claim. |\n| **Consider a GPS tracker** | Small, battery‑powered trackers can be hidden inside luggage. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] **Lost & Found** → Airline baggage desk.  \n- [ ] **File reports** (airline, airport, police).  \n- [ ] **Contact insurance / credit card**.  \n- [ ] **Secure essentials** (cash, IDs).  \n- [ ] **Follow up** (24 h, 1 week, 2 weeks).  \n- [ ] **Keep all documentation** (receipts, reports, photos).\n\n---\n\nIf you let me know the airport and airline, I can give you the exact phone numbers or online links to file the reports.

Check the owner’s manual** | Look under “Fuel” or “Engine” sections. | The manual lists the exact octane rating and any special requirements (e.g., “Premium 91” or “Regular 87”). |\n| **2. Look at the fuel cap** | Many cars have a sticker or engraving on the cap or inside the fuel door. | It often says “Regular”, “Mid‑grade”, “Premium”, or gives an octane number. |\n| **3. Inspect the dashboard** | Some vehicles display a fuel‑type icon or warning if the wrong fuel is used. | Modern cars can detect octane and alert you. |\n| **4. Check the vehicle’s VIN or model online** | Search the VIN or model name on the manufacturer’s website or a trusted database. | You’ll find the recommended fuel for that specific model year. |\n| **5. Ask the dealership or a trusted mechanic** | Provide your car’s make, model, and year. | They can confirm the correct fuel quickly. |\n\n### Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Do I need “premium” fuel?** | Only if the manual says “Premium” or the engine requires a higher octane (often 91+). Using regular in a premium‑required engine can reduce performance and may trigger a warning light. |\n| **What if I accidentally use the wrong fuel?** | Most cars can handle a few gallons of the wrong octane without damage, but it may affect power, fuel economy, and could trigger a check‑engine light. |\n| **Can I use diesel in a gasoline car?** | No. Diesel and gasoline are chemically different and will damage the engine. |\n| **What if my car is a hybrid?** | Hybrids usually run on regular gasoline; the manual will confirm. |\n\nIf you let me know the make, model, and year of your car, I can give you the exact fuel recommendation right away!",

Know Where Your Points Are\n\n| Where to Check | How |\n|----------------|-----|\n| **Issuer’s website** | Log in to your online account (e.g., Chase, American Express, Capital One). Look for a “Rewards” or “Points” tab. |\n| **Mobile app** | Open the card’s app → “Rewards” or “Points.” |\n| **Statement** | Some issuers list points earned and available on the monthly statement. |\n\n> **Tip:** Keep a note of your points balance and the expiration date (if any).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Explore Redemption Options\n\n| Option | Typical Value | How to Redeem |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Cash/Statement Credit** | 1 point ≈ $0.01 (varies) | Online portal → “Redeem for Cash” or “Pay‑down.” |\n| **Gift Cards** | 1 point ≈ $0.01–$0.02 | Choose from a list of retailers or restaurants. |\n| **Travel (Flights, Hotels, Car Rentals)** | 1 point ≈ $0.01–$0.02 (often higher value) | Book through the issuer’s travel portal. |\n| **Merchandise** | 1 point ≈ $0.01 | Browse the rewards catalog. |\n| **Charitable Donations** | 1 point ≈ $0.01 | Donate to partner charities. |\n| **Transfer to Airline/Hotel Partners** | 1 point ≈ $0.01–$0.02 (often higher) | Transfer via the portal (usually 1:1 or 2:1). |\n\n> **Pro tip:** If you’re looking for the best value, travel or partner transfers often give the highest “dollar per point” return.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Redeem Your Points\n\n### Online (most common)\n\n1. **Log in** to your account.  \n2. Navigate to the **Rewards** section.  \n3. Select the redemption type (cash, travel, etc.).  \n4. Choose the amount or item.  \n5. Confirm the transaction.  \n6. **Check your statement** to ensure the points were deducted and the credit applied.\n\n### Mobile App\n\n- The steps mirror the web portal, but the interface is usually more streamlined.  \n- Some issuers let you redeem directly from the app (e.g., “Pay down balance” button).\n\n### Phone\n\n- Call the customer‑service number on the back of your card.  \n- Ask the representative to redeem points for a cash credit or other option.  \n- Keep the confirmation number handy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Verify the Redemption\n\n| What to Check | Why |\n|---------------|-----|\n| **Points deducted** | Confirms the transaction. |\n| **Credit applied** | For cash/statement credit, ensure the amount shows on your next statement. |\n| **Expiration** | Some issuers add a “no‑expiration” clause after redemption. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them\n\n| Pitfall | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| **Points expire** | Redeem before the expiration date or transfer to a partner that doesn’t expire. |\n| **Low redemption value** | Compare “dollar per point” across options; travel or partner transfers usually beat cash. |\n| **Duplicate redemption** | Double‑check your balance before redeeming again. |\n| **Fees** | Some issuers charge a small fee for certain redemptions (e.g., travel). |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick Example (Chase Ultimate Rewards)\n\n1. Log in → “Rewards.”  \n2. Click “Redeem.”  \n3. Choose “Cash Back” → Enter amount.  \n4. Confirm → Points deducted, cash credit applied to next statement.  \n\n---\n\n### Need a Specific Example?\n\nIf you tell me the name of your card issuer (e.g., Chase Sapphire, American Express Membership Rewards, Capital One Venture), I can give you the exact steps and any special offers they might have right now.",

Common Reasons a Card Gets Declined\n\n| Category | Typical Cause | Quick Fix |\n|----------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Insufficient Funds** | Balance too low or credit limit reached. | Check your account balance or available credit. |\n| **Fraud Prevention** | Unusual activity (new location, large purchase, online vs. in‑store). | Verify the transaction with your bank or add the merchant to your “trusted” list. |\n| **Expired Card** | Card’s expiration date has passed. | Use a new card or update the card details in your wallet/app. |\n| **Incorrect Details** | Wrong PIN, CVV, or expiration date entered. | Double‑check the numbers you typed. |\n| **Security Lock** | Card was temporarily locked for security reasons. | Call the issuer’s customer service to unlock. |\n| **Merchant Issues** | Merchant’s system down or blocked by the issuer. | Try a different payment method or contact the merchant. |\n| **Daily/Monthly Limits** | You’ve hit a preset limit (e.g., daily ATM withdrawal limit). | Wait until the limit resets or request a higher limit. |\n| **Technical Glitch** | Network outage, app bug, or incorrect time on your device. | Restart the app, check your internet connection, or sync your device’s clock. |\n| **Card Not Activated** | New card not activated or activated incorrectly. | Activate the card via the issuer’s website or app. |\n| **Card Type Not Accepted** | Some merchants only accept certain card types (e.g., Visa vs. Mastercard). | Use a different card or ask the merchant for alternatives. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Immediate Steps to Take\n\n1. **Check Your Balance / Credit Limit**  \n   - Log into your online banking or mobile app.  \n   - Verify you have enough funds or available credit.\n\n2. **Verify Card Details**  \n   - Make sure the expiration date, CVV, and PIN are correct.  \n   - If you’re using a mobile wallet, ensure the card is properly added.\n\n3. **Look for Alerts**  \n   - Many banks send an SMS or push notification when a transaction is declined.  \n   - Check your email or app for any messages from your issuer.\n\n4. **Contact Your Issuer**  \n   - Call the number on the back of the card or use the “Contact Us” feature in the app.  \n   - Ask for the specific reason for the decline (most issuers can give you a short explanation).  \n   - If it’s a fraud‑related block, they’ll guide you through the verification steps.\n\n5. **Try a Different Payment Method**  \n   - If you’re in a hurry, use a different card or a digital wallet (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) while you sort out the issue.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Prevent Future Declines\n\n| Tip | Why It Helps |\n|-----|--------------|\n| **Keep an eye on your balance** | Avoid hitting the limit. |\n| **Set up alerts** | Get notified of large or suspicious transactions. |\n| **Update your card details** | If you change your phone or wallet, make sure the new device has the latest card info. |\n| **Enable “Contactless” or “Mobile Pay”** | These methods often bypass some of the manual entry steps that can trigger declines. |\n| **Check for pending authorizations** | Some merchants keep a hold on your card; these can reduce available credit. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can I still use the card after a decline?** | Yes, unless the issuer has blocked it. |\n| **Will a declined transaction appear on my statement?** | Usually not, but it may show as a “pending” or “declined” transaction. |\n| **Do I need to pay a fee for a declined transaction?** | Typically no, but some merchants may charge a small “processing” fee if the transaction is reversed. |\n\n---\n\nIf you let me know the card type (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express) or the issuer (e.g., Chase, Capital One, Bank of America), I can give you more tailored advice or the exact phone number to call.",

      "question": "i need a recipe for chicken cordon bleu",
      "system_answer": "## Classic Chicken Cordon Bleu  \n*(Serves 4 – about 4–5 min per side of chicken)*  \n\n### Ingredients\n\n| Item | Quantity | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|\n| Boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts | 4 (≈ 6 oz each) | Flatten to ½‑inch thickness |\n| Swiss cheese slices | 4 | 1 slice per breast |\n| Cooked ham slices | 4 | 1 slice per breast |\n| All‑purpose flour | ½ cup | For dredging |\n| Eggs | 2 | Beaten, with 1 Tbsp milk or water |\n| Bread crumbs (panko or regular) | 1 cup | Lightly seasoned (salt, pepper, paprika) |\n| Unsalted butter | 4 Tbsp | For sautéing |\n| Olive oil | 2 Tbsp | For sautéing |\n| Salt & pepper | to taste | |\n| Optional: Dijon mustard | 1 Tbsp | For extra flavor |\n| Optional: Fresh herbs (parsley, thyme) | 1 Tbsp chopped | For garnish |\n\n### Equipment\n\n- Meat mallet or rolling pin (or a heavy skillet)  \n- Three shallow bowls (flour, eggs, breadcrumbs)  \n- Large skillet or sauté pan  \n- Oven‑proof dish (optional, for finishing)  \n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Prep the Chicken**  \n   1. Place each breast between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper.  \n   2. Pound with a meat mallet or rolling pin to about **½‑inch** thickness.  \n   3. Season both sides lightly with salt and pepper.\n\n2. **Assemble the Roll‑Ups**  \n   1. Lay a slice of ham on each breast, then a slice of Swiss cheese.  \n   2. If using Dijon mustard, spread a thin layer on the ham before adding cheese.  \n   3. Roll each breast tightly, securing with a toothpick or kitchen twine if needed.\n\n3. **Dredge**  \n   1. Set up a dredging station:  \n      - Bowl 1: Flour (add a pinch of salt & pepper).  \n      - Bowl 2: Beaten eggs + 1 Tbsp milk.  \n      - Bowl 3: Breadcrumbs (seasoned).  \n   2. Coat each roll‑up in flour, tapping off excess.  \n   3. Dip in the egg wash, then coat with breadcrumbs.  \n   4. Press crumbs onto the surface to adhere.\n\n4. **Sear**  \n   1. Heat **2 Tbsp olive oil + 2 Tbsp butter** in a large skillet over medium‑high heat.  \n   2. When the butter foams, add the chicken rolls.  \n   3. Sear **4–5 min per side** until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches **165 °F (74 °C)**.  \n   4. Remove from skillet and set aside.\n\n5. **Optional Oven Finish**  \n   - If you want extra crispness or a more even cook, transfer the seared rolls to an oven‑proof dish and bake at **375 °F (190 °C)** for **5–7 min**.  \n   - This step is optional; the skillet alone usually gives a great result.\n\n6. **Rest & Serve**  \n   1. Let the chicken rest for **3–5 min** before cutting.  \n   2. Remove toothpicks or twine.  \n   3. Slice into ½‑inch thick pieces if desired.  \n   4. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Serving Suggestions\n\n| Side | Why it works |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Mashed potatoes** | Creamy base that balances the richness. |\n| **Steamed green beans or asparagus** | Adds color and a fresh bite. |\n| **Rice pilaf or quinoa** | Light, fluffy accompaniment. |\n| **A simple white wine sauce** (e.g., beurre blanc) | Enhances the buttery flavor. |\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Variations\n\n- **Cheese swap**: Gruyère, provolone, or cheddar work well.  \n- **Ham alternatives**: Use turkey breast or prosciutto for a different flavor.  \n- **Breadcrumbs**: Panko gives extra crunch; regular breadcrumbs give a more classic texture.  \n- **Seasoning**: Add a pinch of garlic powder or dried herbs to the breadcrumb mix.  \n- **Make‑ahead**: Assemble the rolls a day ahead, refrigerate, and cook the next day.  \n- **Healthier version**: Use whole‑wheat breadcrumbs and reduce butter to 1 Tbsp.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu!

      "system_answer": "### Short answer  \n**Rice can be part of a healthy diet, but the key is *what kind* you eat, how much, and what you pair it with.**  \n\nBelow is a quick rundown of the pros, cons, and practical tips so you can decide what works best for your goals and taste preferences.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Nutritional Snapshot (per 1 cup cooked, ~158 g)\n\n| Type | Calories | Carbs | Fiber | Protein | Iron | Vitamin B6 | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|---------|------|------------|-------|\n| **White rice** | 205 | 45 g | 0.6 g | 4 g | 0.8 mg | 0.1 mg | Refined, low fiber |\n| **Brown rice** | 216 | 45 g | 3.5 g | 5 g | 0.8 mg | 0.2 mg | Whole grain, higher fiber |\n| **Wild rice** | 166 | 35 g | 3.8 g | 6 g | 1.5 mg | 0.2 mg | Actually a grass, high protein |\n| **Black rice (Forbidden rice)** | 210 | 45 g | 4 g | 4 g | 1.5 mg | 0.2 mg | Antioxidant‑rich |\n| **Red rice** | 215 | 45 g | 3.5 g | 5 g | 1.0 mg | 0.2 mg | Whole grain, high phytonutrients |\n\n> **Tip:** If you’re watching calories or carbs, stick to ½‑cup cooked portions and pair with protein & veggies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Health Benefits\n\n| Benefit | How Rice Helps | Caveats |\n|---------|----------------|---------|\n| **Energy source** | High‑glycemic carbs give quick fuel, especially for athletes or active people. | Over‑consumption can spike blood sugar. |\n| **Whole‑grain fiber** (brown, wild, black, red) | Supports digestion, satiety, and heart health. | White rice lacks fiber; consider mixing. |\n| **Micronutrients** | Contains B‑vitamins, iron, magnesium, and selenium. | Iron in rice is non‑heme; pair with vitamin C for absorption. |\n| **Gluten‑free** | Safe for celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. | Some people still react to the protein (amylase‑trypsin inhibitors). |\n| **Low in fat** | Naturally low‑fat, making it a good base for low‑fat meals. | Be mindful of added sauces or oils. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Potential Downsides\n\n| Issue | Why it matters | Mitigation |\n|-------|----------------|------------|\n| **High glycemic index (GI)** | White rice can cause rapid blood‑sugar spikes. | Pair with protein, healthy fats, or fiber‑rich veggies. |\n| **Arsenic** | Rice plants absorb arsenic from soil/groundwater. | Rinse thoroughly, cook with excess water (1 cup rice : 4 cups water), and choose lower‑arsenic varieties (e.g., basmati, jasmine, or imported rice). |\n| **Caloric density** | Easy to over‑eat if portions aren’t measured. | Use a kitchen scale or measuring cup; aim for ½‑cup cooked per meal. |\n| **Nutrient loss** | Refining removes bran and germ. | Opt for whole‑grain varieties when possible. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Tips for a Balanced Diet\n\n| Situation | Rice Choice | Portion | Pairing Ideas |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|\n| **Weight loss** | Brown or wild rice | ½‑cup cooked | Add lean protein (chicken, tofu) + lots of veggies |\n| **High‑intensity training** | White rice (for quick carbs) | 1‑cup cooked | Follow with protein shake or lean protein |\n| **Gluten‑free meal** | Any rice | 1‑cup cooked | Add beans, lentils, or a protein source |\n| **Low‑carb diet** | Skip rice or use cauliflower rice | 0‑1 cup | Focus on protein + non‑starchy veggies |\n| **Kid‑friendly** | White rice | ½‑cup cooked | Mix with peas, carrots, or a mild sauce |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick “Do’s & Don’ts”\n\n| Do | Don’t |\n|----|-------|\n| Rinse rice before cooking to reduce surface starch and arsenic. | Rely solely on white rice for daily meals. |\n| Use a ratio of 1 cup rice : 4 cups water (or broth) for fluffier results. | Over‑cook; mushy rice can be harder to digest. |\n| Combine rice with a protein source (beans, meat, tofu) to balance macronutrients. | Add sugary sauces or excessive butter/oil. |\n| Choose whole‑grain or colored varieties for extra fiber and antioxidants. | Ignore portion size; 1 cup cooked ≈ 200 cal. |\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- **Yes, rice can be healthy**—especially whole‑grain varieties—if you watch portions and pair it with protein, fiber, and healthy fats.  \n- **White rice** is fine in moderation, but consider swapping to brown, wild, black, or red rice for added nutrients and fiber.  \n- **Mind arsenic** by rinsing, cooking with excess water, and choosing lower‑arsenic brands.\n\nIf you have specific health conditions (diabetes, kidney disease, etc.), it’s a good idea to consult a registered dietitian or your healthcare provider for personalized guidance.",

      "system_answer": "### Southwest Airlines Carry‑On Rules (2025)\n\n| Item | What’s Allowed | Size | Weight | Notes |\n|------|----------------|------|--------|-------|\n| **Carry‑On Bag** | 1 bag per passenger | 24 × 16 × 10 in (61 × 40 × 25 cm) | ≤ 50 lb (23 kg) | Must fit in the overhead bin. |\n| **Personal Item** | 1 item (e.g., backpack, tote, laptop bag, duffel) | 18 × 14 × 8 in (45 × 35 × 20 cm) | No weight limit | Must fit under the seat in front of you. |\n| **Total** | 2 items (carry‑on + personal) | — | — | No extra fees for these items. |\n\n#### Common “Personal Items” Examples\n- Laptop bag or briefcase  \n- Backpack (must fit under the seat)  \n- Tote or duffel (must fit under the seat)  \n- Small duffel or gym bag (fits under the seat)  \n- Baby stroller (if you’re traveling with a child) – counts as a personal item, but you’ll still need a carry‑on bag.\n\n#### What’s Not Allowed\n- **Large duffel bags** that exceed the personal‑item dimensions (must fit under the seat).  \n- **Backpacks** that are too big to fit under the seat.  \n- **Large suitcases** that exceed the carry‑on size or weight limits.  \n- **Items that exceed the weight limit** (50 lb/23 kg) for the carry‑on bag.  \n- **Restricted items** (e.g., flammable liquids, weapons, etc.) – see Southwest’s *Prohibited Items* list.\n\n#### Tips for Packing\n1. **Measure first** – Use a tape measure or a ruler to double‑check dimensions.  \n2. **Weigh your bag** – A kitchen scale or a phone app can help keep you under 50 lb.  \n3. **Use compression bags** – They can help you fit more into the allowed space.  \n4. **Pack a “quick‑access” pouch** – Keep your boarding pass, wallet, phone, and any essentials in a small pouch that’s easy to grab at the gate.  \n5. **Check the “Baggage” tab** on Southwest’s website or app before you travel; sometimes there are updates or special promotions (e.g., “Free Baggage” for certain fare types).\n\n#### Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can I bring a second personal item?** | No. Only one personal item is allowed. |\n| **What if my carry‑on is over 50 lb?** | You’ll be charged a fee (currently $30) or asked to check it in. |\n| **Do I need to pay for carry‑on?** | No. Southwest includes one carry‑on bag and one personal item in the ticket price. |\n| **Can I bring a stroller?** | Yes, as a personal item. |\n| **What about a small suitcase that fits under the seat?** | If it meets the personal‑item dimensions, it counts as a personal item. |\n\n#### Where to Find the Most Current Rules\n- **Southwest Airlines Baggage Policy**: https://www.southwest.com/air/plan/baggage.html  \n- **Prohibited Items**: https://www.southwest.com/air/plan/baggage.html#prohibited-items  \n- **Mobile App**: The “Baggage” section in the Southwest app shows the latest limits and any special promotions.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Bring one carry‑on bag that fits the 24 × 16 × 10 in size limit and one personal item that fits under the seat (18 × 14 × 8 in). No extra fees for these items, but keep the carry‑on under 50 lb to avoid a charge. Happy packing!",

      "question": "i want to know what the purpose of life is",
      "system_answer": "The “purpose of life” is one of the oldest and most personal questions humans have asked. Because it touches on philosophy, religion, psychology, and even science, there isn’t a single, universally accepted answer—but there are many lenses through which people find meaning. Below are a few common perspectives, each with its own strengths and caveats. Feel free to mix and match ideas that resonate with you.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Religious / Spiritual Perspectives**\n\n| Tradition | Core Idea | How It Shapes Life |\n|-----------|-----------|--------------------|\n| **Christianity** | Life is a gift from God; purpose is to love God and others, live according to Scripture, and prepare for an afterlife. | Emphasis on community, service, and moral living. |\n| **Islam** | Life is a test; purpose is to worship Allah, follow the Qur’an, and live righteously. | Focus on obedience, charity, and accountability. |\n| **Buddhism** | Purpose is to end suffering (dukkha) by following the Noble Eightfold Path and achieving enlightenment. | Encourages mindfulness, compassion, and detachment. |\n| **Hinduism** | Life’s purpose is to fulfill dharma (duty), pursue artha (prosperity), enjoy kama (pleasure), and ultimately achieve moksha (liberation). | Balances worldly responsibilities with spiritual growth. |\n| **Judaism** | Purpose is to live a life of mitzvot (commandments) and to bring holiness into the world. | Emphasis on ethical action and community. |\n\n**Takeaway:** Many religious traditions frame purpose as a relationship with the divine, a moral framework, or a path toward an afterlife or liberation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Philosophical / Existential Perspectives**\n\n| Philosopher | Core Idea | How It Shapes Life |\n|-------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| **Aristotle** | Purpose (telos) is *eudaimonia*—human flourishing through virtuous activity. | Encourages developing character, rationality, and social engagement. |\n| **Existentialists (Sartre, Camus)** | Life has no inherent meaning; we create our own purpose through choices and authenticity. | Emphasizes personal responsibility, freedom, and confronting absurdity. |\n| **Utilitarians (Bentham, Mill)** | Purpose is to maximize happiness or utility for the greatest number. | Focuses on consequentialist ethics and social welfare. |\n| **Stoics (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius)** | Purpose is to live in accordance with nature, accept what you cannot control, and cultivate inner virtue. | Promotes resilience, self‑control, and acceptance. |\n\n**Takeaway:** Philosophical views range from objective purposes (e.g., flourishing) to subjective creation (e.g., self‑authenticity). They often provide frameworks for ethical living and personal growth.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Psychological / Humanistic Perspectives**\n\n| Theory | Core Idea | How It Shapes Life |\n|--------|-----------|--------------------|\n| **Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs** | Purpose emerges after basic needs are met; self‑actualization is the ultimate goal. | Encourages pursuing creativity, personal growth, and meaningful relationships. |\n| **Positive Psychology (Seligman)** | Purpose is part of *PERMA*: Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment. | Focuses on building strengths, flow experiences, and a sense of meaning. |\n| **Self‑Determination Theory** | Purpose is tied to autonomy, competence, and relatedness. | Encourages pursuing passions that feel self‑chosen and socially connected. |\n\n**Takeaway:** From a psychological standpoint, purpose is linked to well‑being, personal growth, and meaningful engagement with life.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Scientific / Evolutionary Perspectives**\n\n| Idea | Core Idea | How It Shapes Life |\n|------|-----------|--------------------|\n| **Evolutionary Biology** | Purpose is to survive, reproduce, and pass on genes. | Drives behavior that ensures survival and reproduction. |\n| **Neuroscience** | Purpose may be a brain‑generated narrative that helps us navigate social environments. | Suggests that meaning is a useful heuristic for motivation and social cohesion. |\n\n**Takeaway:** Science often frames purpose in terms of survival and social adaptation, but it also acknowledges that humans create narratives that go beyond mere survival.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Practical, Everyday Approaches**\n\n1. **Set Personal Goals** – Short‑term (daily habits) and long‑term (career, relationships).  \n2. **Cultivate Relationships** – Family, friends, community, and mentorship.  \n3. **Serve Others** – Volunteering, kindness, or any act that benefits others.  \n4. **Pursue Growth** – Learning, creativity, physical health, and emotional resilience.  \n5. **Reflect Regularly** – Journaling, meditation, or therapy to assess what feels meaningful.  \n\n---\n\n## A Few Thought‑Provoking Questions\n\n- **What brings you the most joy or fulfillment?**  \n- **When do you feel most alive or “in the zone”?**  \n- **What legacy would you like to leave?**  \n- **How do you define success?**  \n- **What values guide your decisions?**\n\nAnswering these can help you carve out a personal sense of purpose, even if you don’t find a single “universal” answer.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **There’s no one-size-fits-all answer.**  \n- **Purpose is often a blend of external beliefs (religion, culture) and internal choices (values, goals).**  \n- **Many find purpose through relationships, service, personal growth, or a combination of these.**  \n- **It’s okay for purpose to evolve over time.**  \n\nFeel free to dive deeper into any of these perspectives or let me know if you’d like resources (books, podcasts, courses) to explore a particular angle!",

Here’s how you can find out quickly:\n\n| Method | How to Do It | What You’ll Get |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **OpenTable** | Search “Chima Brazilian Steakhouse” → “Reservations” → “Check Availability.” | Shows current wait times for walk‑ins and how many tables are free. |\n| **Yelp** | Open the restaurant’s Yelp page → “Open” → “Wait Time.” | Gives an estimated wait (e.g., “15‑30 min”) based on recent data. |\n| **Google Maps** | Search the restaurant → “Open” → “Wait time.” | Displays a quick estimate if the restaurant has enabled the feature. |\n| **Call the restaurant** | 1‑800‑555‑1234 (example) | Direct confirmation and any special seating arrangements. |\n| **Restaurant’s own website** | Some chains list wait times or allow you to book a table online. | Real‑time or near‑real‑time updates. |\n\n### Typical Wait Times (for reference)\n\n| Time of Day | Typical Wait (if open) |\n|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Weekdays (12 – 2 p.m.)** | 5–15 min |\n| **Weekdays (6 – 9 p.m.)** | 10–30 min |\n| **Weekends (12 – 2 p.m.)** | 15–30 min |\n| **Weekends (6 – 9 p.m.)** | 20–45 min |\n\n> **Note:** These are averages; actual wait can be shorter or longer depending on specials, holidays, or local events.\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n1. **Book a table in advance** – Even if you’re just looking for a quick bite, a reservation can cut the wait to almost zero.  \n2. **Arrive early** – If you’re planning a dinner, getting there 10–15 min before your reservation can help you snag a spot if you’re a walk‑in.  \n3. **Ask about “early‑bird” specials** – Some steakhouses offer a discounted menu for early diners, which can also reduce wait.  \n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a quick message to the restaurant or set up a reservation link.

      "question": "i'd like to know how to make changes for my insurance policy",
      "system_answer": "Below is a practical, step‑by‑step guide you can follow to make changes to most insurance policies—whether it’s auto, home, renters, health, or life.  \nFeel free to skip the sections that don’t apply to your specific policy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Gather Your Information\n\n| What to Have | Why It Helps |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| **Policy number** | Needed to locate your file quickly. |\n| **Current coverage details** (deductibles, limits, riders) | Helps you decide what to change. |\n| **Personal info** (name, address, DOB, driver’s license number) | Required for identity verification. |\n| **Payment info** (credit card, bank account) | If you’re adding a new rider or changing payment method. |\n| **Documents** (e.g., new vehicle title, new address proof, medical records) | Some changes require proof. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Decide What You Want to Change\n\n| Common Changes | Typical Process |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Add/Remove a driver** | Auto: add a new driver or remove an existing one. |\n| **Change coverage limits** | Increase or decrease liability, collision, or property limits. |\n| **Add a rider/endorsement** | e.g., roadside assistance, flood coverage, or a life‑insurance rider. |\n| **Update personal info** | Address, phone number, email, or marital status. |\n| **Switch payment method** | Credit card, ACH, or paper check. |\n| **Change policy start/end dates** | For term life or temporary coverage. |\n| **Cancel or renew** | End the policy or renew it with new terms. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Choose Your Preferred Method of Contact\n\n| Method | How to Do It | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|--------------|------|------|\n| **Online Portal / Mobile App** | Log in → “My Policies” → “Edit” or “Add Rider.” | Fast, 24/7, often shows updated premium instantly. | Requires account set‑up; some changes may still need a call. |\n| **Phone Call** | Call the customer‑service number on your card or statement. | Immediate confirmation; can ask questions. | Wait times; may need to speak to a specialist. |\n| **Email / Secure Message** | Send a request to the insurer’s secure email address. | Written record; good for complex changes. | Slower response time. |\n| **In‑Person Visit** | Go to a local branch or agent office. | Personal touch; can review documents together. | Requires travel; limited hours. |\n| **Agent / Broker** | If you use an independent agent, they can handle changes for you. | One‑stop shop; often better rates. | May charge a fee or commission. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Step‑by‑Step Example: Changing Coverage on an Auto Policy\n\n1. **Log in** to the insurer’s online portal.  \n2. Navigate to **“My Policies”** → select the auto policy.  \n3. Click **“Edit Coverage”** or **“Add Rider.”**  \n4. Choose the new coverage level (e.g., increase liability from $100k to $300k).  \n5. Review the **premium change**—the portal will show the new monthly/annual cost.  \n6. **Confirm** the change.  \n7. **Save** a copy of the updated policy or confirmation email.  \n8. **Verify** that the new coverage appears on your next statement.\n\nIf you prefer a phone call:\n\n- Call the number on the back of your card.  \n- Tell the agent: “I’d like to increase my liability coverage to $300k.”  \n- Ask for the new premium and any required documentation.  \n- Confirm the change and request a written confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Documents You Might Need\n\n| Change | Typical Documents |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **New address** | Utility bill, lease agreement, or bank statement. |\n| **New driver** | Driver’s license, proof of residency. |\n| **New vehicle** | Title, registration, VIN, insurance history. |\n| **Rider addition** | Proof of eligibility (e.g., flood zone map, medical records). |\n| **Policy cancellation** | Written notice or online cancellation request. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. After the Change\n\n1. **Check your next statement** for the updated premium.  \n2. **Confirm coverage**: Some insurers send a new policy document or an updated e‑policy.  \n3. **Keep a record**: Save the confirmation email or print the updated policy.  \n4. **Set a reminder**: If the change takes effect on a future date, mark it on your calendar.  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Will my premium always go up?** | Not necessarily. Some changes (e.g., adding a rider) increase it; others (e.g., dropping a driver) may lower it. |\n| **Can I make changes mid‑policy?** | Yes, most insurers allow changes at any time, though some may have a “change window” (e.g., 30 days after renewal). |\n| **Do I need to pay a fee?** | Some insurers charge a “policy change fee” for certain edits; check your policy terms. |\n| **What if I’m not satisfied with the new premium?** | You can negotiate, shop around, or consider a different insurer. |\n\n---\n\n### Need a Specific Example?\n\nIf you tell me the type of policy (auto, home, health, life, etc.) and the insurer’s name, I can give you a more tailored walkthrough—complete with exact phone numbers, portal URLs, or agent contact details.

Unlike most amphibians that metamorphose into a terrestrial adult, axolotls keep their gills, dorsal fin, and aquatic lifestyle even when fully grown. This makes them a fascinating model for studying regeneration, because they can regrow limbs, spinal cord, heart tissue, and even parts of their brain—something most animals can’t do.",

      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nNo, Mexico does **not** require any specific vaccination for travelers coming from the United States (or most other countries) as of 2025.  \n\n---\n\n## What you should know\n\n| Vaccine | Why it’s recommended (not required) | Who should consider it |\n|---------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **COVID‑19** | Some airlines or hotels may still ask for proof of vaccination or a negative test. | If you’re traveling on a carrier that requires it, or if you want extra peace of mind. |\n| **Yellow Fever** | Required only if you’re arriving from a country with ongoing yellow‑fever transmission (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Peru). | Travelers coming from or transiting through those countries. |\n| **Hepatitis A** | Common in many parts of Mexico, especially in food‑service settings. | Anyone staying >1 week, or with higher exposure to food/water. |\n| **Hepatitis B** | Recommended for travelers who may have sexual contact, medical procedures, or need tattoos/needles. | Anyone with potential exposure. |\n| **Typhoid** | Risk in rural or lower‑income areas. | Travelers staying in rural areas or eating street food. |\n| **Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap)** | Routine booster every 10 years. | Anyone who hasn’t had a booster in the last decade. |\n| **MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)** | Measles outbreaks still occur worldwide. | Anyone born after 1957 who hasn’t had two MMR shots. |\n| **Varicella (Chickenpox)** | If you’re not immune. | Anyone who never had chickenpox or the vaccine. |\n| **Influenza** | Seasonal flu can be more severe in tropical climates. | Especially if traveling during flu season (late fall–early spring). |\n\n---\n\n## Practical steps before you go\n\n1. **Check the CDC’s “Travelers’ Health” page** for the most up‑to‑date recommendations:  \n   https://www.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/countries/mexico.html\n\n2. **Talk to a travel‑medicine clinic** (or your primary care doctor) 4–6 weeks before departure.  \n   They can give you a personalized vaccine plan and any needed boosters.\n\n3. **Keep a copy of your vaccination records** (digital or paper) in case an airline or hotel asks for proof.\n\n4. **Pack a small medical kit**:  \n   - Over‑the‑counter pain relievers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen)  \n   - Antimalarial (if you’re heading to high‑risk areas)  \n   - Oral rehydration salts (ORS)  \n   - Basic first‑aid supplies\n\n5. **Stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun**—Mexico’s climate can be hot and humid, especially in the summer.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **No mandatory shots** for most travelers from the U.S.  \n- **Yellow fever** only if you’re coming from an endemic country.  \n- **COVID‑19**: No entry requirement, but check airline policies.  \n- **Routine vaccines** (Hep A, Hep B, Typhoid, Tdap, MMR, Varicella, Influenza) are strongly recommended for safety.\n\nEnjoy your trip, Tom!

      "question": "please inform me on bad habits and overcoming them",
      "system_answer": "## Bad Habits That Most People Struggle With  \n*(and how to break them)*  \n\n| Habit | Why It’s Harmful | Quick “Why It’s Bad” Insight |\n|-------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| **Procrastination** | Delays productivity, increases stress, leads to last‑minute mistakes. | “I’ll do it later” → “I’ll never finish on time.” |\n| **Excessive screen time** (especially before bed) | Disrupts sleep, reduces real‑world social interaction, can lead to eye strain. | “Just one more episode” → “I’m exhausted tomorrow.” |\n| **Skipping meals / irregular eating** | Lowers energy, can cause overeating later, affects metabolism. | “I’m too busy” → “I’ll be hungry and overeat.” |\n| **Negative self‑talk** | Lowers confidence, fuels anxiety, can spiral into depression. | “I can’t do this” → “I’ll never succeed.” |\n| **Smoking / vaping** | Health risks, addiction, financial drain. | “It calms me” → “I’m stuck in a cycle.” |\n| **Over‑committing** | Burnout, poor quality work, strained relationships. | “I’ll say yes to everything” → “I’m overwhelmed.” |\n| **Unhealthy snacking** (chips, candy, sugary drinks) | Weight gain, energy crashes, long‑term health issues. | “I need a quick fix” → “I’ll feel sluggish.” |\n| **Skipping exercise** | Decreases physical health, mood, energy. | “I don’t have time” → “I’ll feel sluggish.” |\n| **Poor sleep hygiene** (late bedtimes, irregular schedule) | Impairs cognition, mood, immune function. | “I’ll catch up tomorrow” → “I’m always tired.” |\n| **Impulse buying** | Financial strain, clutter, regret. | “It’s a good deal” → “I’ll regret it later.” |\n\n---\n\n## The Habit Loop (What You’re Really Breaking)\n\n1. **Cue** – The trigger that starts the habit.  \n2. **Routine** – The behavior itself.  \n3. **Reward** – The benefit you get (real or perceived).  \n\nTo break a habit, you need to **identify the cue** and **replace the routine** with a healthier one that delivers a similar reward.\n\n---\n\n## Step‑by‑Step Plan to Overcome a Bad Habit\n\n| Step | What to Do | Example (Procrastination) |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Identify the cue** | Notice *when* and *where* the habit starts. | “I start scrolling on my phone right after lunch.” |\n| **2. Understand the reward** | Ask yourself what you’re actually getting. | “I feel relaxed and less stressed.” |\n| **3. Pick a replacement routine** | Choose a healthier action that gives the same reward. | “I’ll take a 5‑minute walk instead of scrolling.” |\n| **4. Make it easier** | Reduce friction for the new habit. | Keep the phone in another room during work hours. |\n| **5. Use accountability** | Share your goal with a friend or use an app. | “I’ll check in with my buddy every Friday.” |\n| **6. Track progress** | Keep a simple log or use a habit‑tracking app. | Tick off each day you walk instead of scrolling. |\n| **7. Celebrate small wins** | Reward yourself for sticking to the new routine. | Treat yourself to a favorite coffee after a week of success. |\n| **8. Adjust as needed** | If the new routine isn’t working, tweak it. | Maybe a 10‑minute walk or a quick stretch session. |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tools & Techniques\n\n| Tool | How It Helps | Quick Setup |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Habit‑tracking apps** (Habitica, Loop, Streaks) | Visual progress, reminders, gamification | Download, set habit, log daily. |\n| **Pomodoro timer** (25‑min work + 5‑min break) | Breaks work into bite‑sized chunks, reduces procrastination | Use a timer app or website. |\n| **Environment design** | Remove triggers, add cues for good habits | Put phone in another room, keep healthy snacks visible. |\n| **Accountability partner** | Social pressure, shared goals | Pair up with a friend or join a group. |\n| **Cognitive‑Behavioral Techniques** | Reframe negative thoughts, practice self‑compassion | Write down thoughts, challenge them, replace with positive affirmations. |\n| **Reward substitution** | Replace instant gratification with delayed rewards | Instead of a sugary snack, reward yourself with a short walk. |\n| **Micro‑habits** | Start with 1‑minute actions to build momentum | “Just 1 minute of stretching” before bed. |\n\n---\n\n## Example: Breaking the “Procrastination” Habit\n\n| Cue | Routine | Reward | Replacement Routine | New Reward |\n|-----|---------|--------|---------------------|------------|\n| **After lunch** | Check social media | Instant distraction | 5‑minute walk outside | Physical activity + mental reset |\n| **At 3 pm** | Browse news sites | “I’m staying informed” | 10‑minute focused work block (Pomodoro) | Sense of accomplishment |\n| **Before bed** | Scroll through memes | “I’m relaxed” | Read a chapter of a book | Better sleep, mental stimulation |\n\n**Implementation Plan (Week 1)**  \n1. **Day 1–3** – Replace lunch‑time scrolling with a 5‑minute walk.  \n2. **Day 4–6** – Use a Pomodoro timer for 25‑minute work blocks.  \n3. **Day 7** – Reflect: How did the new routine feel? Adjust if needed.  \n\n**Tracking**  \n- Use a simple spreadsheet or a habit‑tracking app.  \n- Mark “✓” each day you completed the new routine.  \n\n**Reward**  \n- After 3 consecutive days of success, treat yourself to a favorite snack (but not a sugary one).  \n\n---\n\n## Quick “One‑Minute” Habit‑Change Checklist\n\n1. **Identify the cue** – When does it happen?  \n2. **Ask “What do I get?”** – What’s the reward?  \n3. **Choose a healthier routine** – That gives the same reward.  \n4. **Make it easy** – Remove barriers, add cues.  \n5. **Track** – One tick per day.  \n6. **Celebrate** – Small reward for consistency.  \n\n---\n\n## Final Thought\n\nBreaking a bad habit isn’t about willpower alone; it’s about **designing your environment, replacing the routine, and celebrating progress**. Start small, stay consistent, and remember that every “no” to the old habit is a “yes” to a healthier you.\n\nIf you’d like a personalized plan for a specific habit (e.g., “stop snacking on chips”), just let me know and I can tailor the steps for you!",
