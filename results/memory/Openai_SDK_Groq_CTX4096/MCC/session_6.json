      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the heart‑rate range that you aim to stay within during aerobic exercise to achieve specific fitness or health goals. It’s expressed as a percentage of your maximum heart rate (often estimated as 220 minus your age).  \n\n| Goal | Target % of max heart rate | Typical exercise intensity |\n|------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Moderate‑intensity cardio** | 50 – 70 % | Brisk walking, light jogging, cycling |\n| **Vigorous‑intensity cardio** | 70 – 85 % | Running, fast cycling, high‑intensity interval training (HIIT) |\n| **Peak training** | 85 – 95 % | Sprinting, intense interval work, competitive sports |\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Cardiovascular fitness**: Staying in the target zone improves heart and lung function.\n- **Weight management**: Higher‑intensity zones burn more calories per minute.\n- **Safety**: Avoiding too low or too high a heart rate reduces the risk of overexertion or injury.\n\n**How to calculate it**\n\n1. **Estimate your maximum heart rate (MHR)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{MHR} \\approx 220 - \\text{age}\n   \\]\n2. **Determine your target zone**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Target HR} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{desired %}\n   \\]\n   For example, a 30‑year‑old with an MHR of 190 beats per minute (bpm) aiming for moderate intensity (55 %) would target about 105 bpm.\n\n**Monitoring**\n\n- Use a heart‑rate monitor (watch, chest strap, or smartphone app).\n- Check your pulse manually (count beats for 15 seconds, multiply by 4).\n\n**Adjustments**\n\n- If you’re new to exercise or have health concerns, consult a healthcare professional before setting target zones.\n- As fitness improves, your MHR may change, so recalculate periodically.\n\nIn short, the target heart rate is the heart‑rate range you strive to hit during exercise to maximize benefits while staying safe.",

It is one of the 20 standard amino acids that make up proteins and plays several key roles:\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Chemical identity** | A non‑polar, aromatic amino acid with the formula C₉H₁₁NO₂. |\n| **Dietary sources** | Protein‑rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, nuts, and some grains. |\n| **Metabolic role** | 1. **Protein synthesis** – incorporated into proteins during translation. 2. **Precursor to tyrosine** – converted by phenylalanine hydroxylase to tyrosine, which in turn is a precursor for neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and thyroid hormones. |\n| **Clinical relevance** | • **Phenylketonuria (PKU)** – a genetic disorder where phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient, leading to toxic accumulation of phenylalanine. Patients must follow a low‑phenylalanine diet. <br>• **Dietary supplements** – sometimes used to support neurotransmitter production or in certain metabolic conditions. |\n| **Regulation** | The body tightly regulates phenylalanine levels; excess is converted to tyrosine or, if conversion is impaired, can accumulate and cause neurological damage. |\n\nIn short, phenylalanine is a building block of proteins and a key precursor in the biosynthesis of several important molecules in the nervous system and endocrine system.",

      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—proteins (or, in a few cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.  \n\n| Key Features | Details |\n|--------------|---------|\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins composed of one or more polypeptide chains folded into a specific 3‑D shape. Some enzymes are ribozymes (RNA catalysts). |\n| **Active Site** | A specialized region where the substrate(s) bind. The shape and chemical environment of the active site are tailored to the reaction it catalyzes. |\n| **Catalytic Mechanism** | Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed faster and at lower temperatures than it would otherwise. They do this by stabilizing the transition state, orienting substrates, or providing a micro‑environment that favors the reaction. |\n| **Specificity** | Enzymes are highly specific: a given enzyme typically acts on one substrate or a small group of closely related substrates. This specificity is often described by the “lock‑and‑key” or “induced fit” models. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by: <br>• **Allosteric effectors** (activators or inhibitors that bind sites other than the active site). <br>• **Covalent modifications** (phosphorylation, acetylation, etc.). <br>• **Gene expression** (amount of enzyme produced). |\n| **Examples** | • **Amylase** – breaks down starch into sugars. <br>• **DNA polymerase** – synthesizes DNA strands. <br>• **Lactase** – digests lactose into glucose and galactose. |\n| **Importance in Biology** | Enzymes drive metabolism (catabolism and anabolism), signal transduction, DNA replication, protein synthesis, and many other essential cellular processes. Without enzymes, biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to sustain life. |\n\nIn essence, enzymes are the workhorses of biochemistry: they make life’s complex chemistry possible by speeding up reactions with remarkable precision and efficiency.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Why it’s yellow | What’s really happening |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | The Sun actually emits almost *white* light (a mix of all visible wavelengths). As that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering). The longer‑wavelength yellow, orange, and red photons travel straight to your eye, so the Sun appears yellow. |\n| **Observer’s location** | Near the horizon the light passes through more atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and making the Sun look more orange‑red. At noon, when the Sun is high, the path through the air is shorter, so the scattering is less and the Sun looks more “white‑ish” or pale yellow. |\n| **Human eye sensitivity** | The human eye is more sensitive to yellow‑green light. Even a small excess of yellow light can make the Sun look yellowish to us. |\n| **Instrumental & cultural factors** | Many photographs and artistic depictions use a yellow‑ish tint to represent the Sun, reinforcing the perception. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is not actually yellow; it shines white. The yellow appearance is a result of atmospheric scattering of blue light and the way our eyes perceive the remaining wavelengths.",

      "question": "What is foot and mouth disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many other livestock species). It is caused by a virus from the *Picornaviridae* family, genus *Aphthovirus* (the most common strain is *FMDV*).\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever, lameness, and swelling of the feet and hooves.<br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that rupture, forming ulcers on the mouth, tongue, and inside the lips.<br>• Loss of appetite, weight loss, and reduced milk production.<br>• In young animals, the disease can be severe and may lead to death. |\n| **Transmission** | • Direct contact with infected animals.<br>• Indirect contact via contaminated feed, water, equipment, or clothing.<br>• Airborne spread over short distances (especially in windy conditions). |\n| **Incubation period** | 2–14 days (typically 4–7 days). |\n| **Affected species** | Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, antelope, and many other cloven‑hooved species. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses from decreased productivity, trade restrictions, culling, and control costs. FMD outbreaks can shut down entire livestock industries in affected regions. |\n| **Control & Prevention** | • **Vaccination** (live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines) – most common in endemic areas.<br>• **Movement restrictions** and quarantine of infected or exposed animals.<br>• **Culling** of infected and sometimes exposed animals.<br>• **Biosecurity measures**: disinfection, controlled access, and monitoring of livestock movements.<br>• **Surveillance**: regular testing of herds, especially in high‑risk zones. |\n| **Regulation** | In many countries, FMD is a notifiable disease. Outbreaks trigger national and international reporting to organizations such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). |\n| **Global status** | FMD is endemic in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It is absent in the United States, Canada, and most of Europe, but strict controls are in place to prevent introduction. |\n\n---\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n- **Animal health**: The disease can cause severe pain and economic loss for farmers.\n- **Trade**: Countries with FMD outbreaks often face trade bans on livestock and animal products.\n- **Public health**: The virus does not infect humans, but it can cause significant economic disruption that indirectly affects food security.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a contagious viral infection of cloven‑hooved animals that causes fever, lameness, and painful mouth blisters. It spreads rapidly through direct contact and contaminated materials, and its control relies on vaccination, strict biosecurity, and, when necessary, culling.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in air, in some cases). It works by emitting a sound pulse (a “ping”) and then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and knowing the speed of sound in the medium, the system can calculate distance, size, shape, and sometimes even the material or speed of the target.\n\n---\n\n### How Sonar Works\n\n| Step | What Happens | Key Concept |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1. **Transmission** | A transducer emits a short burst of sound at a specific frequency. | **Pulse** |\n| 2. **Propagation** | The sound travels through water (or air). | **Speed of sound** (≈ 1,500 m/s in seawater) |\n| 3. **Reflection** | The pulse hits an object and reflects back. | **Echo** |\n| 4. **Reception** | The transducer (now acting as a receiver) picks up the echo. | **Return signal** |\n| 5. **Processing** | The system measures the time delay and analyzes the echo’s characteristics. | **Distance = (speed × time)/2** |\n| 6. **Display/Action** | The data is shown on a screen or used to trigger an action (e.g., navigation, obstacle avoidance). | **Mapping, navigation, detection** |\n\n---\n\n### Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | Purpose | Typical Use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Submarine navigation, fish finders, depth sounding. |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects (e.g., propeller noise). | Anti‑submarine warfare, marine biology studies. |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to create detailed images of the seafloor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys. |\n| **Multibeam Sonar** | Emits multiple beams to map large areas quickly. | Bathymetric mapping, offshore construction. |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Produces high‑resolution images of objects. | Underwater archaeology, rescue operations. |\n\n---\n\n### Key Applications\n\n| Field | Example |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Naval & Military** | Submarine detection, mine countermeasures, navigation. |\n| **Commercial Shipping** | Avoiding underwater hazards, navigation in shallow waters. |\n| **Fishing** | Locating fish schools, measuring depth. |\n| **Marine Research** | Mapping seafloor, studying marine life. |\n| **Oil & Gas** | Pipeline inspection, seabed mapping. |\n| **Search & Rescue** | Locating submerged objects or persons. |\n\n---\n\n### Why Sonar Is Useful\n\n- **Visibility‑independent**: Works in murky water, darkness, or heavy rain where optical methods fail.\n- **Range**: Can detect objects from a few meters to several kilometers away.\n- **Speed**: Provides real‑time feedback for navigation and obstacle avoidance.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nSonar is a sound‑based sensing system that emits pulses, listens for echoes, and uses the time delay to determine the distance and characteristics of objects underwater (or in air). It’s essential for navigation, exploration, military operations, and many commercial and scientific activities.",

It’s considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning the nervous system amplifies pain signals.\n\n---\n\n### Core Features\n\n| Symptom | Typical Presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain in at least two opposite sides of the body, above and below the waist, and at the neck or back. |\n| **Fatigue** | Persistent tiredness that isn’t relieved by sleep. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Trouble falling or staying asleep; non‑restorative sleep. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and mental sluggishness. |\n| **Headaches** | Often tension‑type or migraines. |\n| **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)** | Abdominal pain, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. |\n| **Mood changes** | Anxiety, depression, or mood swings. |\n| **Sensory sensitivities** | Heightened sensitivity to light, sound, or touch. |\n\n---\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nThere’s no single lab test for fibromyalgia. Diagnosis is usually based on:\n\n1. **History & Physical Exam** – Checking for pain in the 18 “tender points” (though tender‑point testing is less emphasized now).\n2. **Symptom Criteria** – The 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria require:\n   - Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥ 7 **and** symptom severity scale (SSS) ≥ 5, **or** WPI 3–6 **and** SSS ≥ 9.\n   - Symptoms present for ≥ 3 months.\n3. **Rule Out Other Conditions** – Blood tests, imaging, or other evaluations to exclude infections, autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n\n- **Genetics** – Family history increases risk.\n- **Infections** – Viral or bacterial infections can trigger onset.\n- **Physical or Emotional Trauma** – Stressful events, accidents, or chronic stress.\n- **Sleep Disturbances** – Poor sleep quality can worsen symptoms.\n- **Neurochemical Imbalances** – Altered levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in pain pathways.\n\n---\n\n### Treatment\n\nFibromyalgia is managed with a multimodal approach:\n\n| Modality | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Medications** | - **Pain relievers** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs)<br>- **Antidepressants** (duloxetine, milnacipran, amitriptyline)<br>- **Anticonvulsants** (gabapentin, pregabalin) |\n| **Lifestyle** | - Regular low‑impact exercise (walking, swimming, yoga)<br>- Sleep hygiene (consistent bedtime, dark room)<br>- Stress‑reduction (mindfulness, CBT, relaxation techniques) |\n| **Physical Therapy** | Targeted stretching, strengthening, and pain‑management techniques. |\n| **Alternative Therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, tai chi, or biofeedback. |\n| **Support** | Patient education, support groups, and counseling. |\n\n---\n\n### Prognosis\n\n- **Chronic** – Symptoms can persist for years, but many people experience periods of remission or improvement.\n- **Variable** – Some patients find effective symptom control; others continue to struggle with pain and fatigue.\n- **Impact** – Can affect work, relationships, and overall quality of life, but with proper management many lead active, fulfilling lives.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition marked by widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive issues. It’s diagnosed clinically, treated with a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and therapy, and often requires ongoing management rather than a single cure.",

      "system_answer": "**Plastic is a synthetic material made from long chains of molecules called polymers.**  \nThese polymers are built from small, repeating units called **monomers** that are chemically bonded together during a process called **polymerization**.  \n\n| What’s in a plastic | Typical monomers & building blocks |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Carbon‑based backbone** | Most plastics are derived from hydrocarbons (C‑H bonds). |\n| **Common monomers** | • **Ethylene** → polyethylene (PE) <br>• **Propylene** → polypropylene (PP) <br>• **Styrene** → polystyrene (PS) <br>• **Vinyl chloride** → polyvinyl chloride (PVC) <br>• **Butadiene** → polybutadiene (used in rubber) |\n| **Additives** | Plastic manufacturers add substances to give the final product desired properties: <br>• **Plasticizers** (e.g., phthalates) – make PVC flexible <br>• **Stabilizers** (e.g., antioxidants, UV absorbers) – protect against heat, light, oxidation <br>• **Fillers** (e.g., talc, calcium carbonate) – improve strength, reduce cost <br>• **Colorants** (pigments, dyes) – give color <br>• **Impact modifiers** (e.g., rubber particles) – improve toughness |\n\n### How it’s made\n\n1. **Feedstock** – Crude oil, natural gas, or biomass is processed to produce the monomers (ethylene, propylene, etc.).  \n2. **Polymerization** – The monomers are chemically linked in a reactor (chain‑growth or step‑growth processes).  \n3. **Processing** – The resulting polymer melt or powder is shaped by extrusion, injection molding, blow molding, or other techniques.  \n4. **Finishing** – Additives are mixed in, and the final product is cooled, cut, or otherwise finished.\n\n### Key take‑away\n\n- **Plastic = polymer + additives.**  \n- The polymer backbone comes from hydrocarbon monomers (ethylene, propylene, etc.).  \n- Additives tailor the material’s flexibility, durability, color, and resistance to heat or chemicals.  \n\nThat’s the basic chemistry behind the everyday plastic items we use—from bottles and bags to car parts and electronics.",

      "system_answer": "**Legally blind** is a medical‑legal classification used to determine eligibility for disability benefits, vision‑related services, and certain legal protections.  The exact criteria can vary by country, but the most widely cited standard is the U.S. definition set by the **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** and adopted by the **Social Security Administration (SSA)**.  \n\n---\n\n## U.S. Definition (HHS/SSA)\n\n| Criterion | Threshold | What it means |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | **20/200 or worse** in the better eye, **with best possible correction** (glasses or contact lenses) | 20/200 is the lowest acuity that still allows a person to see a letter that a person with normal vision can read at 200 ft. |\n| **Visual field** | **Less than 20° radius** (i.e., a total field of less than 40°) in the better eye, **with best possible correction** | A narrow “tunnel” vision that limits peripheral awareness. |\n| **Either** | – | The person can meet **either** the acuity **or** the field criterion. |\n\n> **Note:** The criteria are applied to the *better* eye after correction. If both eyes are worse, the worse eye’s measurement is used.\n\n---\n\n## How the Criteria Are Applied\n\n1. **Best‑correction visual acuity**  \n   - The eye is examined with the best possible glasses or contact lenses.  \n   - If the best‑corrected acuity is 20/200 or worse, the person is legally blind.\n\n2. **Visual field test**  \n   - A perimetry test (e.g., Humphrey Field Analyzer) measures the radius of the visual field.  \n   - If the radius is less than 20°, the person is legally blind.\n\n3. **If both criteria are met**  \n   - The person is still considered legally blind; the more severe measurement is used for documentation.\n\n---\n\n## International Variations\n\n| Country | Typical Criterion | Notes |\n|---------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Canada** | **20/200** or **visual field < 20°** | Same as U.S. but used for disability benefits. |\n| **United Kingdom** | **20/200** or **visual field < 20°** | Used for the *National Disability Insurance Scheme* (NDIS). |\n| **Australia** | **20/200** or **visual field < 20°** | Applied for disability support services. |\n| **European Union** | Varies by member state; many use **20/200** or **visual field < 20°** | Some countries use 20/400 for certain benefits. |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n- **Disability benefits**: Eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and other programs.  \n- **Vision‑related services**: Access to low‑vision aids, orientation & mobility training, and specialized equipment.  \n- **Legal protections**: Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other anti‑discrimination laws.  \n- **Insurance**: Certain vision insurance plans may cover services for legally blind individuals.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n- **Legally blind** = **Visual acuity ≤ 20/200** *or* **visual field radius < 20°** in the better eye, after best correction.  \n- The measurement is taken in the *better* eye; if both eyes are worse, the worse eye’s measurement is used.  \n- These thresholds are used for federal disability benefits and many state‑level programs.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether you meet the criteria, a comprehensive eye exam by an optometrist or ophthalmologist can provide the necessary documentation.",

The most common type is a **triangular prism**, where the bases are triangles and the lateral faces are rectangles.\n\n### Key Properties\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Bases** | Two identical, parallel polygons (triangles, rectangles, etc.). |\n| **Lateral faces** | Parallelograms that connect corresponding edges of the bases. |\n| **Edges** | Three sets of parallel edges: one set along each base, and one set along each lateral face. |\n| **Vertices** | Twice the number of vertices in the base (e.g., a triangular prism has 6 vertices). |\n| **Volume** | \\(V = \\text{(area of base)} \\times \\text{(height)}\\). |\n| **Surface area** | Sum of the areas of the two bases plus the areas of all lateral faces. |\n\n### Why Prisms Matter\n\n- **Optics**: A prism can refract (bend) light, splitting white light into its component colors (a spectrum). This is due to the change in light speed when it enters a medium with a different refractive index.\n- **Engineering**: Prisms are used in optical instruments (e.g., binoculars, cameras) and in structural components where a specific shape is needed.\n- **Mathematics**: Prisms are a fundamental class of polyhedra, useful for teaching concepts like cross‑sections, volume, and surface area.\n\n### Common Types\n\n| Type | Base shape | Example |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **Triangular prism** | Triangle | Classic “box” shape with triangular ends. |\n| **Rectangular prism** | Rectangle (often a cube) | Boxes, bricks, and many everyday objects. |\n| **Pentagonal prism** | Pentagon | Less common, but used in some architectural designs. |\n\nIn short, a prism is a 3‑D shape with two parallel, congruent bases and parallelogram sides, widely used in geometry, optics, and engineering.",

The term is most often used for *peptic ulcers* (stomach or duodenal) and *mouth ulcers*, but it can refer to any open sore that develops from chronic irritation, infection, or disease.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What Happens at the Cellular Level?\n\n| Step | What’s going on |\n|------|-----------------|\n| **Epithelial breakdown** | The protective lining (mucosa or skin) is eroded. |\n| **Inflammation** | Immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages) flood the area, releasing cytokines and enzymes. |\n| **Pain & bleeding** | Nerve endings are exposed; blood vessels may rupture, causing bleeding or a “red” base. |\n| **Healing** | If the underlying cause is removed, fibroblasts lay down new collagen, and the ulcer closes. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Common Types of Ulcers\n\n| Type | Typical location | Common causes |\n|------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Peptic (gastric/duodenal) ulcer** | Stomach lining or first part of small intestine | *Helicobacter pylori* infection, NSAID use, stress, smoking, alcohol |\n| **Mouth (aphthous) ulcer** | Oral mucosa (tongue, inner cheeks, gums) | Minor trauma, stress, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes, immune dysregulation |\n| **Pressure (decubitus) ulcer** | Skin over bony prominences (e.g., heels, sacrum) | Prolonged immobility, friction, moisture, poor nutrition |\n| **Venous stasis ulcer** | Lower leg, especially the medial malleolus | Chronic venous insufficiency, varicose veins |\n| **Diabetic ulcer** | Foot (especially plantar surface) | Peripheral neuropathy, poor circulation, infection |\n| **Burn ulcer** | Skin after thermal, chemical, or radiation injury | Direct tissue destruction |\n| **Traumatic ulcer** | Any area exposed to repeated injury | Repeated friction or pressure |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Symptoms to Watch For\n\n| Symptom | What it indicates |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Pain** | Often throbbing or burning; may worsen with eating (gastric ulcers) or at night (mouth ulcers). |\n| **Bleeding** | Visible blood or black tarry stools (gastric ulcer) or bleeding from the ulcer site. |\n| **Red or white base** | Red indicates active inflammation; white or yellow indicates crust or granulation tissue. |\n| **Size & depth** | Larger, deeper ulcers are more likely to bleed or become infected. |\n| **Associated systemic signs** | Fever, weight loss, anemia, or signs of infection (pus, foul odor). |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Diagnosis\n\n| Method | What it reveals |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **Endoscopy** | Direct visualization of gastric/duodenal ulcers; allows biopsy for *H. pylori*. |\n| **Biopsy** | Confirms *H. pylori*, malignancy, or other pathology. |\n| **Blood tests** | CBC (anemia), inflammatory markers, *H. pylori* serology. |\n| **Imaging** | X‑ray, CT, or MRI for deep or complicated ulcers (e.g., perforation). |\n| **Wound assessment** | For pressure or diabetic ulcers: size, depth, presence of infection. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Treatment Overview\n\n| Goal | Typical interventions |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| **Eliminate the cause** | Stop NSAIDs, treat *H. pylori* with antibiotics + proton‑pump inhibitor (PPI). |\n| **Reduce acid** | PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole), H₂ blockers (ranitidine). |\n| **Protect the lining** | Sucralfate, misoprostol (especially in NSAID‑related ulcers). |\n| **Manage pain** | Acetaminophen (avoid NSAIDs), topical lidocaine for mouth ulcers. |\n| **Promote healing** | Adequate nutrition, avoid alcohol, smoking cessation. |\n| **Treat infection** | Antibiotics for bacterial ulcers; topical antibiotics for skin ulcers. |\n| **Supportive care** | Pressure offloading devices for pressure ulcers; compression stockings for venous ulcers. |\n| **Surgery** | Rarely needed for peptic ulcers (perforation, bleeding); more common for severe pressure ulcers. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Prevention Tips\n\n| Situation | Prevention strategy |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| **NSAID use** | Use the lowest effective dose, consider COX‑2 selective agents, or add a PPI. |\n| **Stress** | Mind‑body techniques, adequate sleep, balanced diet. |\n| **Pressure ulcers** | Regular repositioning, use of pressure‑relieving mattresses, keep skin dry. |\n| **Diabetes** | Tight glycemic control, foot inspections, proper footwear. |\n| **Mouth ulcers** | Avoid sharp or abrasive foods, use fluoride mouthwash, treat vitamin deficiencies. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nAn ulcer is an open sore that forms when the protective lining of a tissue is damaged and fails to heal quickly.  The underlying cause—whether infection, medication, chronic disease, or mechanical injury—must be identified and addressed to promote healing and prevent complications.",

In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” because it is added to the balance and then future interest is calculated on the new, larger amount.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Basic Formula\n\nFor a principal \\(P\\) invested at an annual nominal rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 5 % = 0.05) that is compounded \\(n\\) times per year, the balance after \\(t\\) years is\n\n\\[\nA = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = amount after \\(t\\) years  \n- \\(P\\) = initial principal  \n- \\(r\\) = annual interest rate (decimal)  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year  \n- \\(t\\) = number of years\n\n### Common Compounding Frequencies\n\n| \\(n\\) | Frequency | Example |\n|-------|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | Annually | Once per year |\n| 2 | Semi‑annually | Twice per year |\n| 4 | Quarterly | Four times per year |\n| 12 | Monthly | Twelve times per year |\n| 365 | Daily | Every day (continuous compounding is the limit as \\(n \\to \\infty\\)) |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How It Differs From Simple Interest\n\n| Feature | Simple Interest | Compound Interest |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Formula** | \\(A = P(1 + rt)\\) | \\(A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\) |\n| **Interest calculation** | Only on the original principal | On the principal *plus* all previously earned interest |\n| **Growth pattern** | Linear | Exponential |\n| **Typical use** | Short‑term loans, some savings accounts | Most savings accounts, bonds, mortgages, retirement accounts |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  A Quick Example\n\n**Scenario:**  \n- Principal \\(P = \\$1{,}000\\)  \n- Annual rate \\(r = 6\\%\\) (0.06)  \n- Compounded monthly (\\(n = 12\\))  \n- Time \\(t = 3\\) years  \n\n\\[\nA = 1000\\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  = 1000\\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{36}\n  = 1000(1.005)^{36}\n  \\approx 1000 \\times 1.19405\n  \\approx \\$1{,}194.05\n\\]\n\n**Simple interest** for the same terms would be:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{simple}} = 1000(1 + 0.06 \\times 3) = 1000(1 + 0.18) = \\$1{,}180\n\\]\n\nSo, compounding yields about **\\$14 more** over three years.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Why Compounding Matters\n\n1. **Long‑term growth** – The longer the money stays invested, the more pronounced the effect.  \n2. **“Time is money”** – Early investment can lead to significantly larger balances.  \n3. **Inflation protection** – Compounded returns can outpace inflation if the nominal rate exceeds the inflation rate.  \n4. **Debt** – For loans, compound interest can increase the total amount owed if payments are delayed.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Practical Tips\n\n| Situation | What to do |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Saving for retirement** | Maximize contributions early; choose accounts that compound at least monthly. |\n| **Paying off debt** | Pay more than the minimum to reduce the principal faster, thereby reducing future compound interest. |\n| **Choosing a savings account** | Look for higher compounding frequency (daily > monthly) and a higher nominal rate. |\n| **Understanding loan terms** | Confirm whether the interest is compounded daily, monthly, or annually; this affects the effective annual rate (EAR). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nCompound interest is the “interest on interest” that turns a linear growth into exponential growth. It’s the engine behind the power of long‑term investing and the reason why early, consistent contributions can lead to substantial wealth over time.",

      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why Hybridization Exists\n\n- **Molecular geometry**: The shapes of molecules (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal planar, linear) are not easily explained by the pure atomic orbitals (s, p, d) that exist in isolated atoms.\n- **Bonding directionality**: Covalent bonds are directional; the overlap of orbitals must point toward the positions of bonded atoms.\n- **Energy considerations**: Hybrid orbitals often have lower energy than the original atomic orbitals, making bonding more favorable.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The Basic Hybridization Types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example molecules |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃, H₂O (with lone pairs) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, C₂H₄, CO₂ |\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | CO, H₂C≡CH, BeCl₂ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅, SF₄ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆, XeF₆ |\n\n> **Note**: The “d” orbitals are used only for elements in the third period or higher (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur, xenon). For second‑period elements, the “d” orbitals are not involved; instead, the geometry is explained by the VSEPR model.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How Hybridization Works (Step‑by‑Step)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count the number of sigma bonds + lone pairs around it.  \n2. **Determine the electron‑pair geometry** (VSEPR) – this tells you how many hybrid orbitals are needed.  \n3. **Mix the appropriate atomic orbitals** to create hybrid orbitals that are:\n   - **Equal in energy** (so they’re equivalent).\n   - **Directed** toward the positions of the bonded atoms or lone pairs.\n4. **Form sigma bonds** by overlap of one hybrid orbital from the central atom with an orbital from a surrounding atom.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n1. **Carbon** has 4 valence electrons: 2 s + 2 p.  \n2. **Electron‑pair geometry**: 4 bonding pairs → tetrahedral.  \n3. **Hybridization**: sp³ (1 s + 3 p → 4 sp³ orbitals).  \n4. **Bonding**: Each sp³ orbital overlaps with an H 1s orbital → 4 C–H σ bonds.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Common Misconceptions\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|---------|\n| “Hybridization is a real physical mixing of orbitals.” | It’s a **model** that helps predict geometry; the actual wavefunctions are more complex. |\n| “All molecules with a tetrahedral shape are sp³.” | Only the central atom’s orbitals hybridize; peripheral atoms may use pure orbitals. |\n| “Hybridization explains π bonds.” | π bonds arise from the side‑by‑side overlap of unhybridized p orbitals (or d orbitals in some cases). |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  When Hybridization Is Not Used\n\n- **Second‑period elements** (B, C, N, O, F, Ne) rarely use d orbitals; their geometries are explained by VSEPR alone.  \n- **Large, highly delocalized systems** (e.g., aromatic rings) are better described by molecular orbital theory rather than simple hybridization.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap\n\n- **Hybridization** = mixing of atomic orbitals to form new, equivalent orbitals that match the observed geometry of a molecule.  \n- **Common types**: sp³, sp², sp, sp³d, sp³d².  \n- **Purpose**: Provides a simple, intuitive way to predict bond angles and shapes in covalent molecules.",

How fast is alcohol absorbed?**\n\n| Stage | Typical time frame | What happens |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Ingestion** | 0 – 5 minutes | Alcohol enters the stomach. |\n| **Absorption into bloodstream** | 5 – 30 minutes | Most of the alcohol is absorbed through the stomach lining and the small intestine. |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | 30 – 90 minutes after drinking | The BAC reaches its maximum. |\n| **Metabolism** | 1–2 hours after peak | The liver metabolizes alcohol at roughly 0.015 % BAC per hour (≈ 0.3 g/L per hour). |\n\n**Key points**\n\n- **Rate depends on many factors**:  \n  - **Food**: A full stomach slows absorption (delays peak BAC by ~30 min).  \n  - **Body weight & composition**: More body water → lower peak BAC.  \n  - **Gender**: Women generally reach higher BACs than men of the same weight.  \n  - **Alcohol concentration**: Higher‑proof drinks raise BAC faster.  \n  - **Metabolic rate**: Genetics and liver health influence how quickly alcohol is cleared.\n\n- **Typical numbers**:  \n  - A standard drink (≈ 14 g of pure alcohol) in a 70‑kg adult usually raises BAC by ~0.02 % (≈ 0.2 g/L) after 30–60 minutes.  \n  - For a 60‑kg person, the same drink might raise BAC by ~0.025 % (≈ 0.25 g/L).\n\n---\n\n**2. Who was the first American to walk in space?**\n\nThe first American astronaut to perform a spacewalk (extravehicular activity, EVA) was **William A. Anders**.  \n- **Mission**: Apollo 8 (December 1968).  \n- **EVA**: While the crew was orbiting the Moon, Anders and fellow astronaut Frank Borman conducted a brief EVA to inspect the spacecraft’s exterior.  \n- **Significance**: Anders became the first American—and the second person overall—to walk outside a spacecraft (the first being Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in 1965).",

      "question": "How cold should a refrigerator be ?",
      "system_answer": "**Ideal Refrigerator Temperature**\n\n| Compartment | Recommended Temperature | Why it matters |\n|-------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| **Refrigerator (fresh‑food section)** | **0 °F to 5 °F (‑18 °C to ‑15 °C)** | Keeps perishable foods safe, slows bacterial growth, preserves quality. |\n| **Freezer** | **0 °F (‑18 °C)** | Maintains food frozen solid; prevents spoilage and freezer burn. |\n\n> **Tip:** Most modern refrigerators have a built‑in thermometer or digital display. If yours doesn’t, you can use a cheap appliance thermometer (often sold in the same box as a kitchen thermometer).\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why 0 °F to 5 °F?\n\n- **Food‑Safety Standard**: The USDA and FDA recommend that refrigerators stay at or below 40 °F (4 °C) for general storage, but the *optimal* range for most household refrigerators is 0 °F to 5 °F.  \n- **Bacterial Growth**: Most harmful bacteria (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E. coli*) multiply rapidly above 40 °F. Keeping the fridge at 0 °F–5 °F keeps them in check and extends shelf life.  \n- **Energy Efficiency**: Setting the fridge too cold (e.g., below 0 °F) wastes energy and can cause condensation or frost buildup.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  How to Check & Adjust\n\n1. **Place a thermometer** in the middle of the fridge (not in a door or near a vent).  \n2. **Wait 24 hours** after setting a new temperature.  \n3. **Read the thermometer**.  \n4. **Adjust the dial** (or digital setting) by 1–2 °F increments until you hit the target range.  \n\n---\n\n## 3.  Common Misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| “Set it to 32 °F (0 °C) to keep food fresh.” | 32 °F is the freezing point of water; most foods will start to freeze or become soggy. |\n| “The fridge should be as cold as possible.” | Too cold can cause condensation, frost, and higher energy bills. |\n| “The freezer can be warmer than the fridge.” | The freezer should stay at 0 °F; a warmer freezer will thaw food and encourage bacterial growth. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Special Cases\n\n| Situation | Recommended Temperature |\n|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Storing raw poultry or fish** | 0 °F to 5 °F (keep them at the coldest part of the fridge). |\n| **Storing dairy** | 0 °F to 5 °F; avoid the door where temperature fluctuates. |\n| **Storing cooked leftovers** | 0 °F to 5 °F; reheat to 165 °F before eating. |\n| **Storing wine** | 45 °F to 55 °F (if you have a wine fridge). |\n| **Storing baby formula** | 32 °F to 40 °F (if you’re using a fridge‑freezer combo). |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  When to Call a Technician\n\n- **Temperature fluctuates wildly** (e.g., 40 °F to 70 °F).  \n- **Frost buildup** in the freezer or on the fridge walls.  \n- **Unusual noises** (compressor or fan).  \n- **The fridge isn’t cooling** after adjusting the thermostat.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Thermometer in the fridge (center).  \n- [ ] Temperature set to 0 °F–5 °F.  \n- [ ] Door seals are tight (no drafts).  \n- [ ] Shelves and drawers are organized (air can circulate).  \n- [ ] Freezer at 0 °F.  \n\nKeeping your refrigerator in this range ensures food safety, preserves quality, and keeps energy usage in check.",

It is one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adults.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How It Happens\n\n| Step | What Happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Exposure** | You inhale or ingest the bacteria from an infected person’s droplets (coughs, sneezes, or talking). |\n| **Colonization** | The bacteria attach to the mucous membranes of the throat and begin to multiply. |\n| **Inflammation** | The immune system responds, producing pain, swelling, and redness. |\n| **Symptoms** | The classic “strep” picture appears: sudden sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and white patches on the tonsils. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Key Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical Features |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **Sore throat** | Sudden, severe pain; often worse when swallowing. |\n| **Fever** | Usually ≥ 38 °C (100.4 °F). |\n| **Swollen tonsils** | May have white or yellow patches (exudates). |\n| **Tender cervical lymph nodes** | Swollen, painful lymph nodes in the neck. |\n| **Headache & body aches** | Common, especially in children. |\n| **No cough or runny nose** | Unlike viral pharyngitis, strep throat rarely has a cough or nasal congestion. |\n| **Rash (scarlet fever)** | In some cases, a fine, sand‑paper rash may appear. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Diagnosis\n\n| Method | What it looks for |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT)** | Detects streptococcal antigens in a throat swab; results in 5–15 minutes. |\n| **Throat culture** | Gold standard; grows bacteria on agar plates; takes 24–48 hours. |\n| **Clinical scoring systems** (e.g., Centor or McIsaac) | Helps decide whether testing is needed. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Treatment\n\n| Treatment | Details |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Antibiotics** | Penicillin or amoxicillin are first‑line; alternatives include cephalosporins, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) for penicillin‑allergic patients. |\n| **Duration** | 10 days of antibiotics (or 5 days of a macrolide). |\n| **Symptom relief** | Analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen), throat lozenges, warm salt‑water gargles. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Essential for recovery. |\n\n**Why antibiotics?**  \nThey eradicate the bacteria, shorten symptoms, prevent complications (e.g., rheumatic fever, peritonsillar abscess), and reduce transmission.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Complications (if untreated)\n\n| Complication | How it develops |\n|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Rheumatic fever** | Autoimmune reaction that can damage heart valves. |\n| **Post‑streptococcal glomerulonephritis** | Kidney inflammation. |\n| **Peritonsillar abscess** | Pus collection near the tonsils. |\n| **Sepsis** | Rare but serious systemic infection. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Prevention\n\n| Strategy | How it helps |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Hand hygiene** | Wash hands with soap for 20 seconds, especially after coughing or sneezing. |\n| **Respiratory etiquette** | Cover mouth/nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing/sneezing. |\n| **Avoid close contact** | Stay away from infected individuals when possible. |\n| **Vaccination** | No vaccine for strep throat; prevention relies on hygiene. |\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Quick Takeaway\n\n- **Strep throat** = bacterial infection of the throat by *Streptococcus pyogenes*.  \n- **Symptoms**: sudden sore throat, fever, swollen tonsils, white patches, no cough.  \n- **Diagnosis**: rapid antigen test or throat culture.  \n- **Treatment**: antibiotics (penicillin/ amoxicillin) + symptom relief.  \n- **Complications**: rheumatic fever, kidney inflammation, abscesses.  \n- **Prevention**: good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.",

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": "**Poliomyelitis (Polio)** is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause paralysis and, in severe cases, death. It is caused by the **polio virus (poliovirus)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family. The virus is transmitted primarily through the **fecal‑oral route** (contaminated food or water) and, less commonly, by direct contact with an infected person.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How the Virus Works\n\n1. **Entry** – The virus enters the body via the mouth and reaches the small intestine.  \n2. **Replication** – It multiplies in the intestinal lining and then spreads through the bloodstream.  \n3. **Neuroinvasion** – In a minority of cases, the virus crosses the blood‑brain barrier and infects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem.  \n4. **Damage** – Infected motor neurons die, leading to loss of muscle control.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Clinical Forms\n\n| Form | Description | Typical Symptoms |\n|------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Non‑paralytic (asymptomatic)** | Most infections (≈ 90 %) cause no symptoms. | None. |\n| **Non‑paralytic (symptomatic)** | Mild flu‑like illness. | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild abdominal pain, headache. |\n| **Paralytic** | Rare (≈ 1 % of infections). | Sudden muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis (often asymmetric), loss of reflexes, respiratory failure in severe cases. |\n| **Post‑polio syndrome** | Years after recovery, patients may experience new weakness, fatigue, and pain. | Progressive muscle weakness, fatigue, pain. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Transmission\n\n- **Fecal‑oral**: Ingesting food or water contaminated with stool from an infected person.  \n- **Direct contact**: Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus.  \n- **Rare**: Airborne transmission is not a significant route.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Prevention\n\n| Strategy | Details |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: <br>• **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)** – injected, used in the U.S. and many countries. <br>• **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** – contains live attenuated virus, used in many low‑resource settings. <br>Both prevent infection and transmission. |\n| **Sanitation** | Clean water, proper sewage disposal, handwashing. |\n| **Surveillance** | Monitoring for cases to detect outbreaks early. |\n\n> **Global status**: Polio has been eradicated in most of the world. The last naturally occurring case of wild poliovirus was reported in 2014 (in Afghanistan). However, vaccine‑derived poliovirus can still circulate in under‑vaccinated populations.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Treatment\n\n- **Supportive care** – There is no antiviral treatment for polio. Management focuses on:\n  - **Respiratory support** (ventilators) for severe paralysis.\n  - **Physical therapy** to maintain muscle strength.\n  - **Pain management** and prevention of complications (e.g., contractures).\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Historical Impact\n\n- **Early 20th century**: Polio epidemics caused widespread paralysis and death.  \n- **1955**: First effective polio vaccine (Salk IPV) introduced.  \n- **1961**: Oral polio vaccine (Sabin) developed, enabling mass immunization campaigns.  \n- **1990s–2000s**: Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) launched, leading to a >99 % reduction in cases.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Quick Facts\n\n| Fact | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| **Virus type** | RNA, non‑enveloped, icosahedral. |\n| **Incubation period** | 7–14 days (range 3–35 days). |\n| **Paralysis rate** | ~1 % of infections. |\n| **Mortality** | < 1 % of paralytic cases (depends on respiratory support). |\n| **Vaccination coverage** | > 90 % in many countries; gaps remain in some regions. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPoliomyelitis is a viral disease that can cause paralysis by destroying motor neurons. It is preventable with vaccination and has been largely eliminated worldwide, but vigilance remains essential to prevent outbreaks in under‑vaccinated communities.",

By modeling how waves travel through the core, we infer a temperature that matches the observed velocities. | 5 500 – 6 000 °C |\n| **Laboratory melting curves of iron alloys** | The core is mainly iron with light elements (S, Si, O, etc.). The melting point of iron at the core’s pressure (~3.5 million bar) gives a lower bound. | ~5 000 °C |\n| **Geodynamo models** | The magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core. Models that reproduce the field’s strength and pattern require a certain temperature gradient. | 5 500 – 6 500 °C |\n| **Heat flow measurements** | Surface heat flow (~0.07 W m⁻²) combined with models of mantle convection and core cooling gives a range. | 5 000 – 7 000 °C |\n\n---\n\n### Why the range?\n\n- **Pressure uncertainty**: The exact pressure at the center (~3.5 million bar) is known, but small variations affect the melting curve of iron.  \n- **Composition**: The presence of light elements (S, Si, O, C) lowers the melting point of iron, shifting the temperature estimate.  \n- **Dynamic processes**: The core is not static; convection, phase changes, and heat production from radioactive decay add complexity.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference\n\n| Layer | Depth | Temperature (approx.) |\n|-------|-------|------------------------|\n| Outer core (liquid) | 2 900 – 5 150 km | 4 000 – 5 000 °C |\n| Inner core (solid) | 5 150 – 6 371 km (center) | 5 000 – 7 000 °C |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The Earth’s core is as hot as the surface of the Sun—roughly 5 000 – 7 000 °C—though the exact value depends on the core’s composition and the physics of iron under extreme pressure.",

      "question": "What is solar wind ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It flows outward through the entire solar system, carrying with it the Sun’s magnetic field and influencing planetary magnetospheres, space weather, and the interplanetary medium.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  How It Forms\n\n| Step | Process | Key Points |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| **Coronal heating** | The Sun’s corona is heated to millions of kelvin, giving particles enough thermal energy to escape the Sun’s gravity. | Temperature ≈ 1–3 million K. |\n| **Pressure gradient** | Hot plasma expands outward, creating a pressure gradient that pushes particles away. | Drives the outflow. |\n| **Magnetic field lines** | The Sun’s magnetic field guides the plasma along open field lines, especially near coronal holes. | Determines direction and speed. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Properties\n\n| Property | Typical Value | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Speed** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ (slow wind) to > 1,500 km s⁻¹ (fast wind) | Fast wind originates from coronal holes. |\n| **Density** | ~ 5–10 particles cm⁻³ at 1 AU | Decreases roughly as 1/r². |\n| **Temperature** | 1–3 million K (protons), electrons slightly cooler | Maintains high energy. |\n| **Composition** | ~ 95 % protons, 4 % alpha particles, 1 % heavier ions | Minor species include O⁶⁺, Fe⁶⁺, etc. |\n| **Magnetic field** | ~ 5 nT at 1 AU | Carries the Sun’s magnetic flux outward. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Effects on the Solar System\n\n| Effect | What Happens |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Planetary magnetospheres** | Solar wind compresses the magnetosphere on the dayside and creates a magnetotail. |\n| **Auroras** | Charged particles precipitate into polar atmospheres, producing the Northern and Southern Lights. |\n| **Spacecraft** | Induces currents in satellites, can damage electronics, and affects GPS accuracy. |\n| **Heliosphere** | Forms the heliopause where the solar wind meets the interstellar medium. |\n| **Cosmic ray modulation** | Solar wind shields Earth from high‑energy cosmic rays; stronger wind → lower cosmic ray flux. |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Key Observations\n\n- **In situ measurements**: Spacecraft such as *Parker Solar Probe*, *Solar Orbiter*, *ACE*, and *Wind* directly sample the wind’s speed, density, and magnetic field.  \n- **Remote sensing**: Coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers track coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are large, transient enhancements of the solar wind.  \n- **Ground‑based**: Radio scintillation and ionospheric monitoring reveal solar wind variations.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Why It Matters\n\n- **Space weather forecasting**: Solar wind conditions predict geomagnetic storms that can disrupt power grids, communications, and navigation.  \n- **Astrophysical laboratory**: The solar wind is the nearest example of a magnetized plasma outflow, helping us understand stellar winds in other stars.  \n- **Planetary science**: It shapes planetary atmospheres (e.g., Mars’ atmospheric loss) and informs the study of exoplanetary environments.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Solar wind is a hot, magnetized plasma stream streaming from the Sun, shaping the space environment throughout the solar system and driving many space‑weather phenomena.",

Key Performance Metrics\n\n| Metric | What It Means |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Efficiency** | % of incident solar power converted to electricity. |\n| **Open‑circuit voltage (Voc)** | Max voltage when no load is connected. |\n| **Short‑circuit current (Isc)** | Current when terminals are shorted. |\n| **Fill factor (FF)** | Ratio of actual power to the product of Voc and Isc. |\n| **Temperature coefficient** | How performance changes with temperature. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Typical Applications\n\n| Application | Why Solar Cells Fit |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| **Residential rooftops** | Low‑profile, grid‑connected, net metering. |\n| **Utility‑scale farms** | Large arrays, high efficiency, minimal land use. |\n| **Portable electronics** | Small, lightweight, flexible panels. |\n| **Spacecraft** | High reliability, low mass, radiation‑hard. |\n| **Building‑Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)** | Dual function as building material and power source. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Advantages & Challenges\n\n| Advantage | Challenge |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| **Renewable & clean** | **Cost** – still higher than fossil fuels in many regions. |\n| **Scalable** | **Intermittency** – requires storage or grid integration. |\n| **Low operating cost** | **Material scarcity** – e.g., silver, tellurium. |\n| **Modular** | **Degradation** – efficiency drops over time (~0.5 %/year). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSolar cells are semiconductor devices that transform sunlight into usable electricity.

      "question": "What is severance pay ?",
      "system_answer": "**Severance pay** is a financial benefit that an employer may provide to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually through a layoff, termination, or mutual separation. It’s not a legal requirement in most places (except for specific circumstances such as mass layoffs or certain collective‑bargaining agreements), but many companies offer it as a goodwill gesture, to help with transition, or to comply with contractual or regulatory obligations.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Core Elements\n\n| Element | What it Means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Payment amount** | Often a set number of weeks or months of salary (e.g., 2 weeks per year of service). |\n| **Eligibility** | Depends on company policy, employment contract, or union agreement. |\n| **Timing** | Usually paid after the final day of work, sometimes in installments. |\n| **Taxation** | In most jurisdictions, severance is treated as ordinary income and is subject to withholding. |\n| **Conditions** | May require the employee to sign a release of claims, agree to a non‑disparagement clause, or maintain confidentiality. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why Employers Offer Severance\n\n| Reason | Typical Practice |\n|--------|------------------|\n| **Legal compliance** | Some states (e.g., California’s WARN Act) require notice and sometimes payment for mass layoffs. |\n| **Reputation** | A generous severance package can preserve goodwill and reduce negative word‑of‑mouth. |\n| **Retention of talent** | Helps keep employees productive during transition and may reduce turnover of remaining staff. |\n| **Risk mitigation** | A release of claims can protect the company from future litigation. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Common Types of Severance Packages\n\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Standard severance** | Fixed weeks/months of pay, often plus accrued vacation or paid time off. |\n| **Extended severance** | Longer payment periods (e.g., 6–12 months) for senior executives or key personnel. |\n| **Severance with benefits** | Continuation of health insurance, retirement contributions, or other benefits for a limited time. |\n| **Severance with outplacement services** | Career counseling, résumé workshops, or job‑search assistance. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Typical Calculations\n\n| Example | Calculation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **2 weeks per year of service** | 10 years of service → 20 weeks of pay. |\n| **Monthly salary** | $4,000/month × 20 weeks ÷ 4 weeks/month = $20,000. |\n| **Including accrued vacation** | Add the value of unused vacation days (e.g., 10 days × $200/day = $2,000). |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Legal Landscape (U.S. Snapshot)\n\n| State | Key Requirement |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| **California** | WARN Act: 60‑day notice and severance for layoffs of 50+ employees. |\n| **New York** | WARN Act: 60‑day notice for layoffs of 50+ employees. |\n| **Other states** | No universal severance law; severance is usually voluntary or contract‑based. |\n\n*Note:* In many countries, severance is governed by labor codes, collective agreements, or statutory “termination pay” provisions.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Practical Tips for Employees\n\n1. **Read your contract or handbook** – Look for a severance clause.  \n2. **Ask for a written offer** – Verify the amount, payment schedule, and any conditions.  \n3. **Check tax implications** – Consider how the payment will affect your tax bracket.  \n4. **Negotiate** – If the offer is below market or your expectations, you can request a higher amount or additional benefits.  \n5. **Seek legal advice** – Especially if a release of claims is required.  \n\n---\n\n## 7.  Bottom Line\n\n- **Severance pay** is a negotiated or contractual payment that helps employees transition after job loss.  \n- It’s not universally required, but many employers provide it to manage risk, maintain morale, and support departing staff.  \n- The specifics—amount, duration, and conditions—vary widely depending on company policy, employment contracts, and local laws.",

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": "**Semiconductors** are materials whose ability to conduct electricity lies between that of conductors (like copper) and insulators (like glass). Their electrical properties can be precisely controlled, making them the foundation of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What Makes a Semiconductor Special?\n\n| Property | Why It Matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | A small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can be excited across this gap by heat, light, or electric fields. |\n| **Doping** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (donors or acceptors) introduces extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type), enabling the creation of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), allowing temperature‑sensitive devices and thermally activated switches. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs) have a crystalline lattice that supports well‑defined electronic band structures. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Common Semiconductor Materials\n\n| Material | Typical Use | Band Gap (eV) | Notes |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|-------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | CMOS logic, solar cells, power devices | 1.12 | Most widely used; abundant, inexpensive. |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | High‑speed transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 | Historically important; now mostly in specialized devices. |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | RF/microwave, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 | Direct band gap → efficient light emission. |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 3.26 | Extremely hard, high breakdown voltage. |\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power switches, RF | 3.4 | Direct band gap, high electron mobility. |\n| **Indium Phosphide (InP)** | Lasers, high‑speed photonics | 1.35 | Used in fiber‑optic communications. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How Semiconductors Work (Simplified)\n\n1. **Intrinsic (pure) semiconductor**  \n   - At room temperature, only a few electrons have enough energy to cross the band gap, so conductivity is low.\n\n2. **Doping**  \n   - **n‑type**: Add atoms with more valence electrons (e.g., phosphorus in Si). Extra electrons become mobile carriers.  \n   - **p‑type**: Add atoms with fewer valence electrons (e.g., boron in Si). Creates “holes” that act as positive charge carriers.\n\n3. **p‑n Junction**  \n   - When n‑type and p‑type regions are joined, a depletion zone forms.  \n   - **Diode behavior**: Allows current to flow in one direction (forward bias) but blocks it in the opposite direction (reverse bias).\n\n4. **Transistor (e.g., MOSFET)**  \n   - Uses gate voltage to control the conductivity of a channel between source and drain.  \n   - Enables amplification and switching—core of all digital logic.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Why Semiconductors Are Essential\n\n| Application | Role of Semiconductors |\n|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Computers & smartphones** | Logic gates, memory, processors. |\n| **Power electronics** | Efficient voltage conversion, motor drives. |\n| **Optoelectronics** | LEDs, laser diodes, photodiodes. |\n| **Sensors** | Temperature, pressure, chemical detection. |\n| **Renewable energy** | Solar cells, power inverters. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Key Trends (2024‑2025)\n\n- **Wide‑bandgap materials** (SiC, GaN) are expanding into high‑power, high‑frequency applications.  \n- **2D semiconductors** (MoS₂, WS₂) are being explored for flexible electronics.  \n- **Quantum dots** and **perovskite** materials are pushing solar‑cell efficiencies beyond 25 %.  \n- **Advanced packaging** (3‑D integration, silicon‑on‑insulator) is enabling higher device density.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are engineered materials whose controlled electrical conductivity—achieved through band‑gap engineering and doping—makes them indispensable for everything from microprocessors to solar panels. Their versatility and scalability keep them at the heart of the digital age.",

It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion** that accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, “fried‑egg” appearance of the tissue.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How BSE Works\n\n| Step | What Happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Prion formation** | A normal cellular protein (PrP^C) folds into an abnormal shape (PrP^Sc). |\n| **Propagation** | The misfolded protein induces other normal proteins to adopt the same abnormal shape. |\n| **Accumulation** | Prions build up in the brain, destroying neurons and causing spongy degeneration. |\n| **Symptoms** | In cattle: weight loss, stiffness, loss of coordination, and eventually death. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Transmission\n\n| Route | Details |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Feed‑borne** | The most common route in the 1980s–1990s: cattle were fed protein‑rich feed (often from other cattle) that contained infected brain or spinal tissue. |\n| **Natural** | Rarely, BSE can spread through contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. |\n| **Human (variant CJD)** | Humans can contract a related prion disease (variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease) by eating infected beef products. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  History & Impact\n\n| Year | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| **1986** | First BSE case identified in the UK. |\n| **1990s** | Outbreaks spread to many countries; millions of cattle culled. |\n| **1996** | UK government introduced the **feed ban** (no animal protein in cattle feed). |\n| **2000s** | BSE incidence dropped dramatically; still monitored worldwide. |\n| **Human cases** | About 1,000–2,000 variant CJD cases linked to BSE worldwide (mostly in the UK). |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Prevention & Control\n\n| Measure | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Feed ban** | Prohibits feeding cattle with animal protein, eliminating the main transmission route. |\n| **Surveillance** | Routine testing of cattle, especially those showing neurological signs, and post‑mortem inspections. |\n| **Culling** | Infected or at‑risk animals are slaughtered and removed from the food chain. |\n| **Trace‑back systems** | Track the origin of cattle and feed to quickly isolate outbreaks. |\n| **Public education** | Inform consumers about safe beef handling and cooking practices. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Key Takeaways\n\n- **BSE is a prion disease** that destroys the nervous system of cattle.  \n- **Transmission is mainly through contaminated feed**; strict feed‑ban regulations have largely stopped new cases.  \n- **Humans can be infected** by eating infected beef, leading to a rare but fatal form of CJD.  \n- **Ongoing surveillance** and strict biosecurity measures keep the risk low today.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Mad cow disease is a prion‑based neurological disorder in cattle that, if left unchecked, can spread to humans. Modern regulations and surveillance have dramatically reduced its incidence, but it remains a critical public‑health and agricultural concern.",

The typical composition (by volume) is:\n\n| Component | Typical range | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; gives natural gas its low density and high energy content. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | Adds to heating value; used in petrochemical feedstock. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Often separated for use as LPG. |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Includes n‑butane and isobutane; also separated for LPG. |\n| **Higher‑order hydrocarbons (C₅⁺)** | < 1 % | Pentane, hexane, etc.; usually removed in processing. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑hydrocarbon; removed to meet pipeline specifications. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Inert; reduces heating value; removed in some applications. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.1 % (often < 0.01 %) | Toxic and corrosive; must be scrubbed (sweetening). |\n| **Trace gases** | < 0.1 % | Includes water vapor, helium, argon, neon, etc. |\n\n### Key points\n\n1. **Methane dominates** – it is the primary energy source and the main component that defines natural gas.\n2. **Higher hydrocarbons** (ethane, propane, butane) are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks and are often separated for use as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).\n3. **Non‑hydrocarbon gases** (CO₂, N₂, H₂S) are typically removed or reduced during processing to meet pipeline specifications and safety requirements.\n4. **Variability** – The exact percentages depend on the reservoir, geographic region, and the processing steps applied. For example, “sweet” natural gas has very low H₂S, whereas “sour” gas contains more H₂S and requires more extensive treatment.\n\nIn short, natural gas is a mixture largely of methane with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons and a few non‑hydrocarbon gases that are managed during processing.",
