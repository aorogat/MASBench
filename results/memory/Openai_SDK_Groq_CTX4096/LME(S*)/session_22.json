      "question": "Current Date: 2023/05/30 (Tue) 02:48,\n\n Now Answer the Question: I've been feeling like my chocolate chip cookies need something extra. Any advice?",
      "system_answer": "Here are a handful of tasty ways to give your chocolate‑chip cookies a little extra oomph:\n\n| What to add | Why it works | Quick tip |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Sea‑salt flakes** | A pinch of salt balances sweetness and brings out the chocolate flavor. | Sprinkle a few flakes on top right before baking. |\n| **Nuts** (walnuts, pecans, almonds, or hazelnuts) | Adds crunch, protein, and a nutty depth. | Toast the nuts lightly first for extra flavor. |\n| **Espresso or instant coffee powder** | Intensifies chocolate flavor without making the cookie taste like coffee. | Add 1 tsp per 2 cups of flour. |\n| **Brown butter** | Gives a nutty, caramel‑like richness. | Melt butter until it turns golden brown, then cool slightly before mixing. |\n| **Dried fruit** (cranberries, raisins, chopped dates) | Adds chewiness and a touch of natural sweetness. | Use about ½ cup per 2 cups of flour. |\n| **Caramel or toffee bits** | Sweet, buttery crunch that pairs well with chocolate. | Fold in ½ cup of small caramel pieces. |\n| **Cocoa powder** | Turns them into “double‑chocolate” cookies. | Replace ¼ cup of flour with ¼ cup cocoa. |\n| **Vanilla bean or vanilla extract** | Enhances overall flavor profile. | Use a fresh vanilla bean for a more intense aroma. |\n| **Zest of orange or lemon** | Adds a bright, citrusy contrast. | Grate 1 tsp of zest into the dough. |\n| **Spices** (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom) | Warm, aromatic undertones. | Add ½ tsp of your chosen spice per 2 cups of flour. |\n| **Swirl of peanut butter or Nutella** | Creates a fun “lava” effect and adds protein. | Drop spoonfuls of peanut butter into the dough, then swirl with a knife. |\n| **Chocolate chips in different sizes** | Mix large chunks with small chips for varied texture. | Use a mix of ½‑inch chunks and ¼‑inch chips. |\n| **Mini chocolate chips** | Gives a “sprinkled” look and extra bite. | Sprinkle a handful on top before baking. |\n| **Baking soda vs. baking powder** | Baking soda gives a chewier texture; baking powder yields a lighter cookie. | Try swapping 1 tsp baking soda for 1 tsp baking powder. |\n| **Add a splash of milk or cream** | Moistens the dough for a softer cookie. | Add 1–2 tbsp of milk/cream per 2 cups of flour. |\n\n### A quick “extra‑flavor” recipe tweak\n\n**Ingredients**  \n- 1 cup butter, softened  \n- ¾ cup brown sugar  \n- ½ cup white sugar  \n- 1 egg + 1 egg yolk  \n- 2 tsp vanilla extract (or a split vanilla bean)  \n- 2 cups all‑purpose flour  \n- 1 tsp baking soda  \n- ½ tsp salt  \n- 1 tsp espresso powder (optional)  \n- 1 tsp sea‑salt flakes (optional)  \n- 1 cup chocolate chips  \n- ½ cup chopped walnuts (optional)  \n- ½ tsp cinnamon (optional)\n\n**Method**  \n1. Preheat oven to 350 °F (175 °C).  \n2. Cream butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until fluffy.  \n3. Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla.  \n4. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, espresso powder, sea‑salt flakes, and cinnamon.  \n5. Gradually fold into the butter mixture.  \n6. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.  \n7. Drop rounded tablespoons onto a parchment‑lined sheet.  \n8. Bake 10–12 min, or until edges are golden.  \n9. Cool on a rack; enjoy the extra flavor layers!\n\nFeel free to mix and match any of the suggestions above to suit your taste. Happy baking!",
      "gold_answer": "The user would prefer responses that build upon their previous experimentation with turbinado sugar, suggesting ingredients or techniques that complement its richer flavor. They might not prefer generic cookie-making advice or suggestions that don't take into account their existing use of turbinado sugar.",

Here’s a quick guide to help you feel confident and enjoy the city:\n\n| Topic | Tips |\n|-------|------|\n| **Public Transit** | • **Tokyo Metro & JR lines** are the backbone—use a **Suica** or **Pasmo** card (reloadable, works on buses, subways, and even some taxis). <br>• **Tokyo Metro 24‑hour ticket** (¥1,200) is great if you’ll be hopping between lines. <br>• For longer trips, consider a **JR Pass** (if you’re a foreign visitor) or a **Tokyo Subway Ticket** (24/48/72 h). |\n| **Navigation Apps** | • **Google Maps** or **NAVITIME** (Japanese) give real‑time train schedules and walking directions. <br>• **Hyperdia** is excellent for planning multi‑leg journeys. <br>• **Citymapper** (English) is handy for quick route suggestions. |\n| **Walking & Biking** | • Many neighborhoods (Shibuya, Harajuku, Asakusa) are best explored on foot. <br>• **Tokyo’s bike lanes** are expanding—rent a bike from a **bike‑share** service (e.g., Docomo Bike Share). |\n| **Taxis & Ride‑hailing** | • Taxis are reliable but can be pricey. <br>• Use **JapanTaxi** or **Uber Japan** for fare estimates and driver ratings. <br>• Keep a Japanese address handy; most drivers don’t speak English. |\n| **Etiquette** | • Keep your phone on silent while on trains. <br>• Queue politely at ticket gates and elevators. <br>• Avoid eating or drinking on the train (though it’s becoming more common). |\n| **Safety** | • Tokyo is one of the safest cities in the world—just stay aware of your belongings. <br>• In crowded places, keep your bag close and avoid leaving it unattended. |\n| **Language** | • A few key phrases help: “すみません” (excuse me), “駅はどこですか？” (Where is the station?), “ありがとうございます” (Thank you). <br>• Many station signs now include English, but a translation app can bridge gaps. |\n| **Nightlife & Late‑Night Travel** | • The **JR Yamanote Line** runs 24 h on weekends (check the schedule). <br>• **Night buses** (e.g., Toei Bus) cover major routes after midnight. |\n| **Planning Your Day** | • Map out your itinerary the night before. <br>• Group nearby attractions to minimize back‑tracking. <br>• Use the **Tokyo Official Travel App** for event schedules and discount coupons. |\n\n**Quick Checklist Before You Go:**\n\n1. **Buy a Suica/Pasmo card** (or load a JR Pass).  \n2. **Download a transit app** (Google Maps, Hyperdia).  \n3. **Print or save a map** of the area you’ll visit.  \n4. **Learn a few Japanese phrases** for basic interactions.  \n5. **Check the weather**—Tokyo can be humid in summer and chilly in winter.  \n\nWith these tools and a bit of preparation, you’ll navigate Tokyo like a local in no time. Enjoy your adventure!",

      "system_answer": "The spot you’re thinking of is **Nasi Goreng Bakar** – the little chain‑style restaurant that’s tucked into the 2nd‑floor food court of Cihampelas Walk.  \n\n- **What makes it special:**  \n  - The rice is fried to a slightly charred, smoky finish and then topped with a generous drizzle of sweet‑spicy sauce.  \n  - It comes with a fried egg, a side of sambal, and sometimes a small portion of tempeh or chicken.  \n  - The portion size is just right for a quick lunch or a light dinner, and the price is very reasonable for the quality.\n\n- **Location:**  \n  - Inside Cihampelas Walk, on the 2nd floor, near the food‑court entrance.  \n  - Easy to spot because of its bright red signage and the distinctive “Bakar” (grilled) logo.\n\nIf you’re heading back to Bandung, just head to Cihampelas Walk and look for the red‑signaled Nasi Goreng Bakar – you’ll get that classic, smoky fried‑rice experience again.

      "system_answer": "Here’s a quick, practical guide to help you refresh your bedroom layout without a full renovation:\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why It Helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Clear the space** | Take everything out of the room (or at least move it to the center). | Gives you a blank canvas and lets you see the room’s true dimensions. |\n| **2. Map the room** | Measure the room and create a simple floor‑plan on paper or use a free app (e.g., RoomSketcher, Planner 5D). | Helps you visualize different arrangements and avoid “trial‑and‑error” moves. |\n| **3. Identify focal points** | Decide what you want the room to “look at” – bed, desk, window, or a piece of art. | Keeps the layout intentional and balanced. |\n| **4. Consider traffic flow** | Leave at least 2–3 ft (60–90 cm) of clearance around furniture for easy movement. | Prevents the room from feeling cramped. |\n| **5. Use the “Rule of Three”** | Place three major pieces (bed, dresser, desk) in a balanced arrangement. | Creates visual harmony and makes the room feel cohesive. |\n| **6. Anchor with the bed** | Position the bed against the longest wall or the wall opposite the door (if privacy is a concern). | Gives the room a natural anchor point. |\n| **7. Add a secondary focal point** | Place a desk or a small sofa opposite the bed or near a window. | Adds functional zones without cluttering. |\n| **8. Keep symmetry or intentional asymmetry** | If you like symmetry, mirror the side tables. If you prefer a relaxed vibe, offset one side slightly. | Influences the room’s mood. |\n| **9. Layer lighting** | Combine overhead, task, and ambient lights. Place lamps on side tables or a desk. | Creates depth and flexibility. |\n| **10. Test the layout** | Move furniture into place and walk around. Check for any awkward gaps or blocked doors. | Ensures the arrangement feels comfortable before you commit. |\n| **11. Add personal touches** | Hang art, add plants, or rearrange décor items to finish the look. | Makes the space feel uniquely yours. |\n| **12. Keep a “before” photo** | Take a picture of the room before you start. | Helps you compare and decide if you like the new layout. |\n\n**Quick “Do‑It‑Now” Checklist**\n\n- [ ] Remove all items from the room.\n- [ ] Measure the room and furniture.\n- [ ] Sketch a floor plan (paper or app).\n- [ ] Decide on a focal point (bed, window, art).\n- [ ] Arrange the bed first, then add secondary pieces.\n- [ ] Test traffic flow and adjust as needed.\n- [ ] Add lighting and décor.\n\n**Pro‑Tip:** If you’re unsure about a particular arrangement, try using a cardboard cut‑out of each piece of furniture. Move the cut‑outs around on the floor to see how they fit before moving the actual items.\n\nHappy rearranging!

      "system_answer": "It’s definitely possible that something in your living room is triggering your sneezes. Here’s a quick checklist to help you pinpoint the culprit and get relief:\n\n| Potential Source | Why It Triggers Sneezing | Quick Fix / Test |\n|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Dust & Dust Mites** | Tiny particles and their waste can irritate the nasal passages. | 1. Vacuum the floor, rugs, and upholstery with a HEPA‑filter vacuum.<br>2. Wash bedding, curtains, and any removable fabric in hot water (≥ 60 °C).<br>3. Consider a dust‑mite‑proof cover for pillows and mattresses. |\n| **Pet Dander** | Proteins in pet skin cells, saliva, and urine are common allergens. | 1. Keep pets out of the living room or bathe them regularly.<br>2. Use an air purifier with a HEPA filter.<br>3. Wash pet bedding frequently. |\n| **Mold / Dampness** | Fungal spores can be airborne and cause sneezing. | 1. Inspect for visible mold on walls, ceilings, or behind furniture.<br>2. Use a dehumidifier if humidity > 60 %.<br>3. Clean any moldy spots with a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water). |\n| **New Paint / Wallpaper** | Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or dust from renovation can irritate. | 1. Ensure the room is well‑ventilated (open windows, use fans).<br>2. If you recently painted, consider a low‑VOC or “no‑VOC” paint. |\n| **Pollen / Outdoor Allergens** | Pollen can drift indoors, especially on windy days. | 1. Keep windows closed during high‑pollen periods.<br>2. Use a HEPA air purifier.<br>3. Wash hands and face after outdoor activities. |\n| **Cleaning Products** | Strong fragrances or chemicals can irritate the nose. | 1. Switch to fragrance‑free or hypoallergenic cleaners.<br>2. Use natural alternatives (vinegar, baking soda). |\n| **Air Quality / Ventilation** | Poor airflow can concentrate irritants. | 1. Run a fan or open windows to circulate air.<br>2. Check that HVAC filters are clean and replaced regularly. |\n\n### Quick “Sneezing‑Check” Routine\n1. **Observe** – Note when sneezing spikes (morning, after cleaning, when you open windows, etc.).  \n2. **Isolate** – If possible, spend a few hours in a different room (e.g., bedroom) and see if sneezing decreases.  \n3. **Test** – After cleaning or removing a potential allergen (e.g., vacuuming, washing pet bedding), monitor if symptoms improve.  \n\n### When to Seek Medical Help\n- Sneezing is accompanied by **runny nose, itchy eyes, wheezing, or shortness of breath** → consider an allergy test.  \n- Symptoms persist for **more than a week** or worsen → see a healthcare provider.  \n\n### Quick Relief Tips\n- **Nasal saline rinse** (e.g., Neti pot or saline spray) to clear irritants.  \n- **Over‑the‑counter antihistamines** (diphenhydramine, loratadine) if you suspect allergies.  \n- **Humidifier** (if the air is dry) to keep nasal passages moist.  \n\nIf you try the above steps and still feel like the living room is the culprit, a professional indoor air quality assessment can pinpoint hidden allergens or mold. Let me know if you’d like more detailed guidance on any of these steps!",
