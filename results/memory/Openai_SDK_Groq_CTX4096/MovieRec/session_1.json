      "system_answer": "I’ve seen *Get Out* (2017) and it’s definitely worth watching—especially if you’re looking for a horror film that’s more about social commentary than just jump‑scares. The film blends psychological thriller elements with sharp satire, and Jordan Peele’s direction keeps the tension high while delivering a surprisingly thoughtful narrative.\n\nIf you enjoy *Get Out*, you might also like:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it’s similar |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| **Us** | 2019 | Peele’s follow‑up, with a creepy twist on identity and family dynamics. |\n| **The Babadook** | 2014 | A psychological horror that focuses on grief and mental health. |\n| **Hereditary** | 2018 | A slow‑burn supernatural thriller that builds dread over time. |\n| **Midsommar** | 2019 | A folk horror that’s unsettling in daylight, with strong social themes. |\n| **The Cabin in the Woods** | 2011 | A meta‑horror that plays with genre conventions while still delivering scares. |\n\nIf you’re looking for something a bit lighter but still in the horror‑comedy vein, *Shaun of the Dead* (2004) or *Tucker & Dale vs. Evil* (2010) are great choices.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these or if you’re after a different sub‑genre!",

      "system_answer": "Hey! 👋\n\n**Short answer:**  \n- **A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)** – Absolutely a classic slasher horror. It’s creepy, atmospheric, and definitely scary (especially if you’re into the “dream‑world” terror vibe).  \n- **A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge (1985)** – Still a horror film, but it leans more into a supernatural/psychological thriller. It’s not as relentlessly scary as the first one, but it has its own eerie moments.\n\n---\n\n### If you’re looking for more “scary” vibes similar to those films:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it fits |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| **The Shining** | 1980 | Classic psychological horror with a chilling atmosphere. |\n| **The Exorcist** | 1973 | One of the most terrifying supernatural horror movies ever made. |\n| **The Ring** | 2002 | A modern horror with a creepy videotape and a slow‑burn dread. |\n| **The Others** | 2001 | A spooky, atmospheric ghost story that keeps you on edge. |\n| **The Babadook** | 2014 | A psychological horror that’s both unsettling and emotionally resonant. |\n| **Hereditary** | 2018 | A modern horror that’s intense, disturbing, and truly scary. |\n| **The Conjuring** | 2013 | A supernatural horror that’s well‑crafted and genuinely frightening. |\n| **It (2017)** | 2017 | You already watched it—great choice! It’s a mix of supernatural horror and psychological terror. |\n| **The Cabin in the Woods** | 2011 | A meta‑horror that plays with classic tropes while delivering genuine scares. |\n| **Sinister** | 2012 | A horror film that’s creepy, atmospheric, and full of unsettling imagery. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick recommendation if you want something that blends action (like *Avengers: Infinity War*) with horror:\n\n- **The Dark Knight (2008)** – Not horror, but a dark, gritty action‑thriller with a menacing villain (the Joker).  \n- **Blade (1998)** – A superhero action film with a strong horror vibe (vampires, dark atmosphere).  \n- **The Matrix (1999)** – Action‑packed with a cyber‑punk, slightly dystopian feel that can feel a bit “scary” in its world‑building.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re in the mood for a different genre (comedy, sci‑fi, etc.).

The trio must retrace their steps, piecing together the chaos to find the missing pieces before the wedding.\n- **Tone:** R‑rated, raunchy comedy with a lot of slap‑stick and absurd situations.\n\n### **The Hangover Part II (2011)**\n- **Plot:** The same trio travels to Thailand for a wedding. They again wake up with no recollection of the previous night, only to discover a missing friend, a kidnapped bride, and a series of outrageous mishaps. They must navigate the Thai jungle and local customs to recover everyone.\n- **Tone:** Similar to the first film—over‑the‑top humor, but with a tropical twist.\n\n### **The Hangover Part III (2014)**\n- **Plot:** The gang is on a road trip to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, but the groom’s brother is missing.
