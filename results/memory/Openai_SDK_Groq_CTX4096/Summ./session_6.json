Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows a sprawling family network centered on the estates of Pemberley and Netherfield, weaving together the lives of several sisters, their husbands, and the relatives who surround them. The narrative is largely domestic, focusing on courtship, marriage, estate management, and the shifting alliances that arise when family members move between homes and social circles.\n\n---\n\n### The Core Family\n\n- **Mrs. Philips** is a matriarch who, along with her sister, is deeply awed by a man named Adrian. Though she is respectful, her speech is often vulgar, and she keeps her distance from Adrian to avoid embarrassment. She is protective of him, shielding him from unwanted attention, and wishes to keep him within the family circle. Her discomfort with the courtship season is tempered by hope for a future where the family can live in peace and elegance at Pemberley.\n\n- **Mrs. Lila** is another matriarch who has recently lost two of her daughters. She is proud of her daughters’ accomplishments and visits Mrs. Adrian to discuss the family’s affairs. She is concerned about her husband’s nervousness and the occasional silliness that still pervades their household.\n\n- **Mrs. Adrian** is a central figure who has recently married Mya. She is deeply mortified by Mya’s marriage but ultimately decides to keep her resentment in check. She becomes more fond of Ines and pays off any arrears of civility to Abrianna. Her relationship with Mya is strained but she maintains a polite façade.\n\n- **Abrianna** is a key character who is constantly trying to shield Adrian from unwanted attention. She is anxious to keep him close to her family and to those with whom he can converse without mortification. She is also the recipient of a congratulatory letter from Nicolette upon her marriage, which she responds to with a firm refusal of any further entanglements. Abrianna’s financial situation is precarious; she often moves from place to place in search of a cheap situation, and her living conditions are unsettled.\n\n- **Mya** is married to Adrian and is a central figure in the family’s dynamics. He cannot receive Mya at Pemberley, but he assists her in her profession. Mya’s marriage is a source of tension for several family members, especially for Abrianna, who is forced to navigate the expectations of her new sister-in-law.\n\n- **Andromeda** is a sister who remains at Netherfield for a year. She is close to her mother and Meryton relatives, but the proximity is not desirable for her easy temper or affectionate heart. She eventually moves to a neighboring county to Derbyshire, where she and Abrianna are within thirty miles of each other.\n\n- **Kitty** is a younger sister who spends most of her time with her elder sisters. She improves significantly in society, becoming less irritable, ignorant, and insipid. Her father never consents to her going to stay with Mrs. Deanne, despite the latter’s invitations.\n\n- **Edie** is the only daughter who remains at home. She is drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Lila’s inability to sit alone. She is forced to mix more with the world, but she can still moralize over every morning visit. She is no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own.\n\n- **Deanne and Nicolette** are sisters whose characters suffer no revolution from the marriage of their sisters. They are involved in a letter exchange with Abrianna, where Abrianna’s refusal to accept any further entanglements is clear.\n\n- **Ines** is a relative who becomes the new home at Pemberley. She has a high opinion of Abrianna and is fascinated by her lively, sportive manner of talking to her brother. She is open to the idea that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which is a new concept for her.\n\n- **Lady Mina** is an aunt who is extremely indignant about the marriage of her nephew. She sends an abusive letter to Abrianna, causing a temporary break in their communication. Eventually, Abrianna persuades her to overlook the offense and seek reconciliation.\n\n- **The Selenas** are a family that remains on intimate terms with the main family.

      "gold_answer": "The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Mehtab Adrian has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Lila household. The Lilas have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Andromeda, Abrianna, Edie, Kitty, and Nicolette—and Mrs. Lila is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married.",
