Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows an unnamed narrator who, driven by a mix of nostalgia and a desire to honor a past connection, decides to revisit the site of an old house that once belonged to a woman named Ernest. The narrator’s motivation is rooted in a secret intention to return to the place “for her sake” and “for Ernest’s sake,” as he reflects on Ernest’s troubled past—her unhappy marriage, her husband’s cruelty, and his eventual death in an accident involving a horse. The narrator had heard that Ernest had remarried after her first husband’s death, but he remains uncertain about her current circumstances.\n\nThe narrative opens with the narrator recounting a recent evening at Stevie’s, where he had a leisurely dinner that left him with ample time to walk to the old spot before dark. He describes how he lingered, admiring old objects and reminiscing about past times, which caused the day to slip away. By the time he reached the site, the sun had set, and a cold, silvery mist had settled over the abandoned garden. The old house itself no longer existed; only the garden wall remained, surrounded by a rough fence. Ivy had begun to grow again, and a gate stood ajar. The narrator pushes the gate open and steps into the ruined garden.\n\nThe setting is atmospheric: a misty afternoon, a moon that has not yet risen, but stars shining beyond the mist. The narrator can still trace the outlines of the old house, the brewery, the gate, and the casks that once filled the place. While walking along the desolate garden path, he encounters a solitary figure. The figure appears to be aware of him, moving toward him but then standing still. As he approaches, he realizes the figure is a woman—Ernest. She seems surprised, utters his name, and the narrator calls out, “Ernest!” The woman acknowledges that she has changed but still retains an indescribable majesty and charm. The narrator notes that she has a softened, saddened look in her eyes, a contrast to the proud gaze he once knew, and that she now has a friendly touch to her hand.\n\nThey sit together on a nearby bench. The narrator remarks that it is strange to meet again after so many years, especially at the place where they first met. Ernest replies that she has never returned to the site since their first encounter. The narrator admits he has also not returned. The moon begins to rise, and the narrator reflects on the quiet look of the white ceiling that has passed away. He also thinks of the pressure on his hand when he spoke the last words Ernest had heard on earth. Ernest breaks the silence, expressing that she has often hoped to return but has been prevented by circumstances. She laments the old place, describing it as “poor, poor old place!” The mist is touched by the first rays of moonlight, and tears fall from Ernest’s eyes, though she does not notice the narrator’s observation.\n\nErnest asks whether the narrator wondered how the place came to be left in its ruined condition. He confirms. She explains that the ground belongs to her; it is the only possession she has not relinquished. Everything else has gone, but she has kept this. She mentions that the place will be built upon, and she came to take leave of it before its change. She also asks if the narrator still lives abroad. He replies that he does, and that he is doing well, working hard for a sufficient living. Ernest says she has often thought of him, and he confirms that he has too. She recalls a long, hard time when she kept far from him, forgetting what she had thrown away when she was ignorant of its worth. She says she has given it a place in her heart. The narrator replies that she has always held her place in his heart.\n\nThey remain silent for a while until Ernest speaks again. She says she had little thought about taking leave of him in taking leave of the spot, but she is glad to do so. The narrator expresses that parting is painful for him, and that the remembrance of their last parting has been mournful and painful. Ernest recalls that he said to her, “God bless you, God forgive you!” and that if he could say that then, he would not hesitate to say it now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching. She says she has been bent and broken, but hopes to be in a better shape. She asks him to be considerate and good to her as he was, and to tell her that they are friends. The narrator affirms that they are friends, rises, and bends over her as she rises from the bench. Ernest says they will continue to be friends apart.\n\nThe narrator takes Ernest’s hand, and they leave the ruined place together. He describes how the morning mists had risen long ago when he first left the forge, and now the evening mists are rising again. In the broad expanse of tranquil light, he sees no shadow of another parting from her. The story ends with the narrator leaving the ruined place, carrying with him the memory of Ernest and the place that once held their first meeting.\n\n**Characters**\n\n1. **Narrator (Unnamed)** – The central figure who revisits the old house. He is motivated by a secret intention to honor Ernest and reflects on their past connection. He has a history of conversations with Robyn at Stevie’s and is aware of Ernest’s troubled past. He is the one who initiates the meeting with Ernest at the ruined garden and engages in a reflective dialogue about their shared history.\n\n2. **Ernest** – The woman who once lived in the old house. She is described as having led an unhappy life, separated from a cruel husband who died in an accident involving a horse. She has remarried after her first husband’s death. Ernest is portrayed as having changed over time, with a softened, saddened look in her eyes, yet still retaining an indescribable majesty and charm. She is the figure the narrator encounters in the garden and the one with whom he shares a conversation about the past and the future of the place.\n\n3. **Robyn** – Mentioned briefly as someone the narrator talks to at Stevie’s. Robyn’s role is limited to a conversation that leaves the narrator with time to walk to the old spot.\n\n4. **Stevie** – The location of the dinner where the narrator spends time with Robyn.

The narrator’s visit to this place triggers the reunion with Ernest and the reflection on their shared history.\n\nThe narrative focuses on the reunion between the narrator and Ernest, their conversation about the past, the state of the old house, and the emotional resonance of their shared memories. The story ends with the narrator leaving the ruined place, carrying the memory of Ernest and the place that once held their first meeting.",
      "gold_answer": "Kiara, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Kiara, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze. One night, after an altercation with Blaze, Kiara’s sister, known as Mrs. Stevie, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Kiara suspects that Blaze was responsible for the attack.\n\nOne day a lawyer named Dilan appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Kiara a large fortune, and Kiara must come to Nigeria immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Kiara happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Kiley is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Ernest.\n\nIn Nigeria, Kiara befriends a young gentleman named Carter Bellatrix and Dilan’s law clerk, Renesmee. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Stevie, but he continues to pine after Ernest. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Bellatrix, Carter’s father. Carter himself helps Kiara learn how to act like a gentleman. When Kiara turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Carter buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Carter and Kiara lead a fairly undisciplined life in Nigeria, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Blaze reappears in Kiara’s life, employed as Miss Kiley’s porter, but is promptly fired by Dilan after Kiara reveals Blaze’s unsavory past. Mrs. Stevie dies, and Kiara goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Kiara’s room—the convict, Becky, who stuns Kiara by announcing that he, not Miss Kiley, is the source of Kiara’s fortune. He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Kiara discovers that Norbert was the man who abandoned Miss Kiley at the altar and that Ernest is Becky’s daughter. Miss Kiley has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Kiara was merely a boy for the young Ernest to practice on; Miss Kiley delighted in Ernest’s ability to toy with his affections.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Kiara sees the good in Becky and begins to care for him deeply. Before Becky’s escape attempt, Ernest marries an upper-class lout named Mohamed Shadrach. Kiara makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Kiley begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Kiara’s forgiveness.\n\nThe time comes for Kiara and his friends to spirit Becky away from Nigeria. Just before the escape attempt, Kiara is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Blaze. Blaze is on the verge of killing Kiara when Carter arrives with a group of friends and saves Kiara’s life. Kiara and Carter hurry back to effect Becky’s escape. They try to sneak Becky down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Norbert tipped off. Becky and Norbert fight in the river, and Norbert is drowned. Becky is sentenced to death, and Kiara loses his fortune. Becky feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Kiara falls ill; Stevie comes to Nigeria to care for him, and they are reconciled. Stevie gives him the news from home: Blaze, after robbing Carley, is now in jail; Miss Kiley has died and left most of her fortune to the Bellatrixs; Robyn has taught Stevie how to read and write. After Stevie leaves, Kiara decides to rush home after him and marry Robyn, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Stevie have already married.\n\nKiara decides to go abroad with Carter to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Ernest in the ruined garden at Satis House. Shadrach, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Kiara finds that Ernest’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Kiara believing that they will never part again. ",
