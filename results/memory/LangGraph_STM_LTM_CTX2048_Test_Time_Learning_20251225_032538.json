      "system_answer": [
        "Hey there! 🎉\n\n**Ocean’s 8** is a fun, slick heist comedy that follows a new generation of thieves—this time all women—who plan a daring robbery at the Met Gala. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can expect:\n\n| Element | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **All‑female ensemble** | Sandra Bullock (Diana), Cate Blanchett (Lily), Anne Hathaway (Molly), Mindy Kaling (Maya), Awkwafina (Megan), Melissa McCarthy (Judy), and Rihanna (Molly’s sister). |\n| **Tone** | Light‑hearted, witty, and full of playful banter—think *Ocean’s 7* meets *The Hangover* with a female twist. |\n| **Plot** | The crew pulls off a high‑stakes heist at the Met Gala, but the stakes are higher than ever—there’s a new mastermind, a rival crew, and a lot of “who’s going to get the loot?” drama. |\n| **Why the all‑female cast matters** | It’s a fresh take on the classic heist formula, showcasing strong, diverse female leads who are as clever, charismatic, and resourceful as any male counterpart. It also adds a layer of camaraderie and humor that’s unique to this group. |\n| **Similar films you might enjoy** | • *The Heat* (2004) – a buddy cop comedy with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy<br>• *The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants* (2005) – a fun ensemble of young women on a summer adventure<br>• *The Women* (1939) – a classic all‑female cast drama (for a bit of nostalgia)<br>• *The Last Five Years* (2014) – a musical comedy‑drama with an all‑female cast (if you’re into music) |\n\n**Quick tip:** If you’re looking for more all‑female ensemble movies, *The Heat* and *The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants* are great follow‑ups. If you want something a bit more action‑heavy, *The Last of the Mohicans* (1992) has a strong female lead in a historical adventure.\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you want more recommendations or a deeper dive into the cast’s previous work. Enjoy the heist!"

It’s still creepy, but the scares are more about the psychological breakdown of the protagonist and the idea of possession. |\n\nIf you liked *It* (2017) and are looking for more modern slasher or supernatural horror, you might enjoy:\n\n- **The Conjuring** (2013) – atmospheric ghost‑story with a solid scare factor.  \n- **The Conjuring 2** (2016) – continues the haunting vibe.  \n- **The Cabin in the Woods** (2012) – meta‑horror that’s both clever and genuinely scary.  \n- **Hereditary** (2018) – psychological horror that’s deeply unsettling.  \n- **The Others** (2001) – gothic, atmospheric thriller with a great twist.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like more suggestions in a particular sub‑genre (e.g., pure slasher, psychological, supernatural) or if you’re curious about any of the titles above!

        "Hey! I’ve seen *Men in Black II*—it’s definitely a bit lighter and less iconic than the first one, but it still has that fun Will‑Smith‑Jude‑Lawrence chemistry and a few cool gadgets. If you’re looking for something that keeps the action‑comedy vibe going, you might enjoy:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it fits |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| **Men in Black III** | 2012 | A time‑travel twist that brings back the original duo and adds a new generation of agents. |\n| **I, Robot** | 2004 | A sci‑fi action film starring Will Smith that blends mystery and high‑speed chases. |\n| **Bad Boys II** | 2003 | Another Will‑Smith action‑comedy with a buddy‑cop dynamic and plenty of gunplay. |\n| **The Last Stand** | 2013 | A high‑octane action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, great if you want pure adrenaline. |\n| **The Expendables 2** | 2012 | A star‑packed action ensemble that’s all about big‑screen set pieces. |\n\nIf you’re leaning more toward the fantasy/sci‑fi side, *The Last Airbender* is a fun, albeit campy, take on the original series—though it’s definitely a different flavor from the action‑comedy you seem to enjoy.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more suggestions or if there’s a particular vibe you’re after!"

Here’s a quick list that should hit the spot:\n\n| # | Title | Year | Why it’s a good pick |\n|---|-------|------|----------------------|\n| 1 | **Superbad** | 2007 | Classic teen stoner comedy with hilarious chemistry. |\n| 2 | **Step Brothers** | 2008 | Over‑the‑top humor and a great “stupid” vibe. |\n| 3 | **The Hangover** | 2009 | Wild, unpredictable, and perfect for a laugh‑out‑loud night. |\n| 4 | **This Is the End** | 2013 | Star‑packed comedy‑horror that’s a cult favorite. |\n| 5 | **The Big Lebowski** | 1998 | A cult classic that blends stoner culture with quirky humor. |\n| 6 | **Pineapple Express** | 2008 | (You already love it!) – a solid stoner action‑comedy. |\n| 7 | **Bad Boys** | 1995 | Action‑packed with a comedic buddy dynamic. |\n| 8 | **The 40‑Year‑Old Virgin** | 2005 | Classic Adam Sandler comedy with a good mix of humor and heart. |\n| 9 | **Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy** | 2004 | Over‑the‑top satire that’s still a go‑to for laughs. |\n|10 | **Pitch Perfect** | 2012 | Musical comedy with a fun, upbeat vibe (if you’re up for something a bit different). |\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Mood‑Match” Picks\n\n| Mood | Film | Why |\n|------|------|-----|\n| **Stoner‑Comedy** | *Superbad* | Relatable, goofy, and full of memorable lines. |\n| **Action‑Comedy** | *Bad Boys* | Fast‑paced, witty banter, and solid action. |\n| **Cult‑Comedy** | *The Big Lebowski* | Iconic characters and a laid‑back feel. |\n| **Horror‑Comedy** | *This Is the End* | Combines your love of horror (old *It*) with a laugh‑out‑loud twist. |\n| **Musical Comedy** | *Pitch Perfect* | If you’re in the mood for something lighter and musical. |\n\n---\n\n### About *It*  \nI’m a big fan of the 1990 version—Tim Curry’s Pennywise is unforgettable. The 2017 remake is a bit more “modern” and less creepy for me, but it still has its moments. If you’re into the original, you might also enjoy:\n\n- **The Shining** (1980) – psychological horror with a classic vibe.  \n- **The Exorcist** (1973) – a timeless horror staple.  \n- **The Texas Chain Saw Massacre** (1974) – raw, gritty terror.\n\nLet me know if you want more suggestions in a specific sub‑genre (e.g., stoner, action, or horror‑comedy), or if you’d like a deeper dive into any of the titles above! 🎬🍿"

        "Hey! 👋  \nGot it—looking for a mix of stoner‑comedy vibes and a quick rundown on the 2017 *It* remake. Let’s dive in!\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 2017 *It* – Quick Synopsis\n\n- **Plot**: A group of kids in the town of Derry, Maine, are terrorized by a shape‑shifting entity that takes the form of a clown named Pennywise. The kids, who call themselves the “Losers’ Club,” must confront their deepest fears and band together to defeat the monster.  \n- **Tone**: Dark, atmospheric horror with a strong focus on the kids’ friendship and coming‑of‑age moments.  \n- **Why it’s different from the 1990 version**: The 2017 film is a modern, high‑budget adaptation that expands on the novel’s lore, adds more backstory, and delivers a mix of horror, drama, and a touch of humor (think the “Pennywise” dance scene). It’s definitely scarier and more intense than the 1990 version.\n\n---\n\n## 🍿 Stoner‑Comedy & Party‑Movie Picks\n\n| # | Title | Year | Why it’s a good fit |\n|---|-------|------|---------------------|\n| 1 | **Pineapple Express** | 2008 | Classic stoner‑action comedy with a buddy‑buddy dynamic. |\n| 2 | **Super Troopers** | 2001 | Low‑budget, high‑energy cop comedy—perfect for a laugh‑out‑loud night. |\n| 3 | **Super Troopers 2** | 2018 | Sequel that keeps the same goofy vibe and new shenanigans. |\n| 4 | **The Hangover** | 2010 | Wild, unpredictable, and full of outrageous moments. |\n| 5 | **Girls Trip** | 2017 | Female‑centric comedy with a fun, carefree vibe. |\n| 6 | **Step Brothers** | 2008 | Classic “grown‑up kids” comedy—great for a relaxed binge. |\n| 7 | **The Big Lebowski** | 1998 | Cult classic with a laid‑back, stoner‑friendly tone. |\n| 8 | **This Is the End** | 2013 | A group of actors in a post‑apocalyptic party—fun, meta, and hilarious. |\n| 9 | **The World's End** | 2013 | A group of friends reunite for a pub crawl that turns into a sci‑fi adventure. |\n|10 | **The Nice Guys** | 2016 | A buddy‑cop comedy with a 70s vibe—fun, witty, and action‑packed. |\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 Quick “Watch‑List” for a Party Night\n\n1. **Pineapple Express** (2008) – Start with the classic stoner‑action vibe.  \n2. **Super Troopers** (2001) – Keep the laughs rolling.  \n3. **The Hangover** (2010) – For a wild, unpredictable twist.  \n4. **Girls Trip** (2017) – Add a fun, female‑centric energy.  \n5. **Step Brothers** (2008) – Finish with a goofy, family‑friendly laugh.\n\n---\n\n### Want More?\n\n- **If you’re into more stoner‑comedy**: *Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle* (2004), *Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay* (2008), *The 40‑Year‑Old Virgin* (2005).  \n- **If you want a horror‑comedy blend**: *Shaun of the Dead* (2004), *Zombieland* (2009).  \n- **If you’re curious about the 2017 *It***: I can give you a deeper breakdown of the plot, key scenes, or how it compares to the 1990 version.\n\nJust let me know what you’re in the mood for! 🚀"

        "Hey! 🎬\n\nGot it—looking for a **movie based on a book** that’s either action‑packed or historically grounded (or both). Here are a few solid picks that hit those marks:\n\n| # | Title | Year | Book Source | Why It Fits |\n|---|-------|------|-------------|-------------|\n| **1** | **The Last Samurai** | 2003 | *The Last Samurai* by Helen DeWitt (adapted from the novel “The Last Samurai” by Thomas Keneally) | Epic action, samurai battles, and a deep historical backdrop of 19th‑century Japan. |\n| **2** | **The Revenant** | 2015 | *The Revenant* by Michael Punke | Rugged survival action set in the 1820s American frontier; gritty, intense, and historically flavored. |\n| **3** | **The Imitation Game** | 2014 | *The Imitation Game* by Andrew Hodges | Historical drama with a bit of thriller/action (code‑breaking) set during WWII. |\n| **4** | **The Last of the Mohicans** | 1992 | *The Last of the Mohicans* by James Fenimore Cooper | Classic action‑adventure set during the French & Indian War; full of sword fights and historical context. |\n| **5** | **The Book Thief** | 2013 | *The Book Thief* by Markus Zusak | While more of a drama, it’s a powerful WWII story with moments of tension and historical depth. |\n| **6** | **The Dark Knight** | 2008 | *The Dark Knight* (comic book) | Action‑heavy, but the plot is grounded in a realistic, gritty Gotham City—almost a modern historical setting. |\n| **7** | **The Last of Us** (upcoming) | 2024 (planned) | *The Last of Us* video game (not a book, but a narrative‑rich action story) | If you’re open to a story that’s not strictly a book, this will give you a mix of action and a post‑apocalyptic “historical” feel. |\n\n### Quick Tips for Picking One:\n- **Action + History**: *The Last Samurai* or *The Revenant* are great if you want a lot of fight scenes plus a real historical setting.\n- **Historical Drama with Tension**: *The Imitation Game* or *The Book Thief* give you a more cerebral, period‑accurate vibe.\n- **Classic Adventure**: *The Last of the Mohicans* is a timeless action‑adventure set in colonial America.\n\n---\n\n**Anything else you’re curious about?**  \n- Want a specific era (e.g., WWII, 19th‑century, modern)?  \n- Prefer a certain type of action (sword fights, car chases, espionage)?  \n- Or maybe you’d like a short “watch‑list” for a movie night?\n\nLet me know, and I’ll fine‑tune the suggestions! 🚀"

Here’s the low‑down on the two things you asked about:\n\n| Topic | What to Expect |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Fart jokes** | Shrek has a few classic “fart” moments (think the swamp‑fart scene with the ogre’s “fart‑scented” swamp), but it’s not a *fart‑comedy*. The humor leans more on wordplay, visual gags, and the banter between the characters. So you’ll get plenty of laughs without it feeling like a “fart‑fest.” |\n| **Eddie Murphy (Donkey)** | Eddie’s voice work is a huge part of the film’s charm. He brings a goofy, energetic, and slightly sarcastic vibe to Donkey that balances Shrek’s gruffness. If you enjoy his stand‑up or movies like *Coming to America* or *The Nutty Professor*, you’ll definitely find his performance in *Shrek* worth it. |\n\n**Quick bonus: similar “childish”‑but‑mature comedies you might enjoy:**\n\n| Title | Year | Why it fits |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| **The Princess Bride** | 1987 | A fairy‑tale adventure with witty banter and a mix of romance, action, and humor. |\n| **Monsters, Inc.** | 2001 | Animated, family‑friendly, with a good dose of slapstick and heart. |\n| **The Lego Movie** | 2014 | Fast‑paced, visually playful, and full of jokes that work for all ages. |\n| **Despicable Me** | 2010 | Animated, goofy, and surprisingly heartfelt. |\n| **The Grand Budapest Hotel** | 2014 | Wes Anderson’s quirky style, clever dialogue, and a bit of adult humor. |\n\nEnjoy your Shrek marathon! If you want more suggestions or a different vibe, just let me know. 🍿✨"

      "system_answer": [
        "Sure! Here’s a quick guide on common bad habits and practical ways to break them:\n\n| Bad Habit | Why It’s Harmful | Practical Steps to Overcome It |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Procrastination** | Leads to missed deadlines, increased stress, and lower productivity. | 1. **Set micro‑goals** – break tasks into 5‑minute chunks.<br>2. **Use a timer** (Pomodoro technique).<br>3. **Reward yourself** after each chunk. |\n| **Excessive Screen Time** | Can disrupt sleep, cause eye strain, and reduce real‑world social interaction. | 1. **Schedule “screen‑free” blocks** (e.g., 30 min before bed).<br>2. **Use blue‑light filters** or night‑mode.<br>3. **Replace with a hobby** (reading, drawing, exercise). |\n| **Skipping Meals / Unhealthy Eating** | Causes energy crashes, weight gain, and long‑term health issues. | 1. **Plan meals** ahead of time.<br>2. **Keep healthy snacks** (nuts, fruit) handy.<br>3. **Set reminders** to eat at regular intervals. |\n| **Smoking / Vaping** | Major health risk, costly, and hard to quit. | 1. **Set a quit date** and stick to it.<br>2. **Use nicotine replacement** (patches, gum) if needed.<br>3. **Seek support** (counseling, quitlines, apps). |\n| **Negative Self‑Talk** | Lowers confidence, increases anxiety. | 1. **Catch the thought** and label it.<br>2. **Reframe** it into a positive or neutral statement.<br>3. **Practice gratitude** daily. |\n| **Over‑committing** | Leads to burnout and poor performance. | 1. **Prioritize tasks** (Eisenhower matrix).<br>2. **Learn to say “no”** politely.<br>3. **Schedule downtime** in your calendar. |\n| **Impulse Buying** | Hurts finances and creates clutter. | 1. **Implement a 24‑hour rule** before purchases.<br>2. **Track spending** in a budgeting app.<br>3. **Create a wish list** and review it weekly. |\n| **Poor Sleep Hygiene** | Affects mood, cognition, and health. | 1. **Keep a consistent bedtime**.<br>2. **Create a wind‑down routine** (no screens, dim lights).<br>3. **Limit caffeine** after 2 pm. |\n| **Avoiding Physical Activity** | Increases risk of chronic disease and lowers energy. | 1. **Set a realistic goal** (e.g., 10 min walk daily).<br>2. **Find a workout buddy** or join a class.<br>3. **Track progress** with a fitness app. |\n| **Neglecting Self‑Care** | Leads to burnout and emotional exhaustion. | 1. **Schedule “me time”** weekly.<br>2. **Try mindfulness** or meditation apps.<br>3. **Set boundaries** with work and social media. |\n\n### Quick Action Plan\n1. **Pick one habit** to tackle first.  \n2. **Write down** why it matters to you and what the benefit of change will be.  \n3. **Create a concrete, small step** you can do today (e.g., “I’ll take a 5‑minute walk after lunch”).  \n4. **Track your progress** in a journal or habit‑tracking app.  \n5. **Reward yourself** for sticking to the plan for a week, then reassess.\n\n### Resources\n- **Habit‑building apps**: Habitica, Streaks, or Loop.  \n- **Mindfulness**: Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer.  \n- **Financial tracking**: Mint, YNAB, or PocketGuard.  \n- **Quit smoking**: Smokefree.gov, QuitNow, or local support groups.\n\nFeel free to let me know which habit you’d like to focus on, and I can give you a more tailored plan!"

This helps ensure you’re exercising at the right intensity for your goals and reduces the risk of over‑ or under‑training."

        "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—proteins (or, in rare cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms.  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Catalytic role** | They lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed faster and at lower temperatures than it would otherwise. |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one particular substrate (or a small group of related substrates) and converts it into a specific product. |\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins with a unique three‑dimensional shape. The active site, a pocket or groove on the enzyme, binds the substrate(s) and facilitates the reaction. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by factors such as pH, temperature, inhibitors, activators, and allosteric effectors. |\n| **Reusability** | Enzymes are not consumed in the reaction; they can catalyze many cycles of the same reaction. |\n| **Biological importance** | They drive essential processes—digestion, DNA replication, energy production (e.g., ATP synthesis), signal transduction, and many others. |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the “workhorses” of metabolism, enabling life‑sustaining reactions to occur efficiently and under the mild conditions found in cells."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Reason | What Happens | Why It Matters |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Earth’s Atmosphere** | Sunlight is a mix of all visible colors (a white spectrum). As it passes through the atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength light (blue, violet) is scattered in all directions by air molecules and tiny particles (Rayleigh scattering). | The scattered blue light is what we see from the sky, so the direct beam that reaches our eyes is depleted of blue and appears more yellow‑white. |\n| **Observer’s Position** | When the Sun is high in the sky (mid‑day), the light travels a shorter path through the atmosphere, so less scattering occurs and the Sun looks whiter. When it’s near the horizon (sunrise/sunset), the light travels through more atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving a stronger yellow‑red tint. | This explains why the Sun can look “pale” at noon and “golden” at sunrise/sunset. |\n| **Human Vision** | Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light. Even a small shift toward the yellow part of the spectrum can make the Sun appear yellowish to us. | The perception of color is partly a function of the eye’s photoreceptors. |\n| **Sun’s True Color** | The Sun’s surface (photosphere) emits light with a temperature of about 5,800 K, which is close to a “white” or slightly “yellowish‑white” color in the visible spectrum. | Astronomical observations (outside Earth’s atmosphere) show the Sun as essentially white. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun itself is not yellow; it emits white light. It appears yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters away the blue part of the spectrum, leaving a yellow‑white beam that reaches our eyes."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many other livestock).  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | A picornavirus of the *Picornaviridae* family (FMD virus, FMDV). There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 104 °F) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, inside the mouth, and on the teats (in dairy cattle) <br>• Vesicles on the feet and hooves (hence the name) <br>• Lameness, difficulty chewing, and reduced milk production. <br>• In young animals, severe dehydration and death can occur. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from: <br>• Reduced milk and meat production <br>• Culling of infected animals <br>• Trade restrictions (countries often ban imports from FMD‑affected regions) <br>• Costs of vaccination, biosecurity, and surveillance. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Strict quarantine and movement controls <br>• Vaccination (live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines) – often required in endemic regions <br>• Biosecurity measures: disinfectants, controlled access to farms, and proper disposal of carcasses <br>• Rapid reporting and isolation of suspected cases. |\n| **Human health** | FMD is **not** transmissible to humans. Humans can handle infected animals or products safely if proper hygiene is observed. |\n| **Global status** | The disease is endemic in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It has caused major outbreaks in the UK (2001), the US (2004), and other countries, leading to significant economic losses. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of cloven‑hooved animals, leading to serious economic consequences for livestock producers worldwide."

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media).  \n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission** – A sonar system emits a short burst of sound (a “ping”) into the water.  \n2. **Propagation** – The sound travels through the medium at a known speed (≈1,500 m/s in seawater).  \n3. **Reflection** – When the sound wave hits an object (e.g., a submarine, fish, or the seafloor), part of it is reflected back.  \n4. **Reception** – Hydrophones (underwater microphones) pick up the echo.  \n5. **Processing** – The time delay between transmission and reception, combined with the known sound speed, gives the distance to the target. The echo’s frequency shift (Doppler effect) can reveal the target’s speed and direction.\n\n### Types of Sonar\n| Type | Purpose | Typical Use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active sonar** | Emits sound and listens for echoes | Navigation, depth sounding, submarine detection |\n| **Passive sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects | Detecting ships, submarines, marine life |\n| **Imaging sonar** | Creates detailed images of objects or the seafloor | Underwater archaeology, mine detection |\n| **Side‑scan sonar** | Scans a wide area to produce a panoramic image | Mapping the seafloor, locating wrecks |\n\n### Key Applications\n- **Naval**: submarine detection, mine hunting, navigation.  \n- **Commercial**: fishing (to locate schools of fish), offshore oil & gas (pipeline inspection).  \n- **Scientific**: mapping ocean topography, studying marine life.  \n- **Recreational**: fishing, diving, underwater photography.\n\n### Why It Matters\n- Sound travels far better in water than light, making sonar the primary means of “seeing” underwater.  \n- It enables safe navigation, resource exploration, and national security operations.\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound waves instead of radio waves to “see” what lies beneath the surface."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain, tenderness, and a range of other symptoms. It is considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning the nervous system amplifies pain signals.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n| Symptom | Typical Presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain in muscles, tendons, and soft tissues, often described as a constant dull ache lasting at least 3 months. |\n| **Tender points** | 18 specific spots on the body (e.g., neck, shoulders, elbows, hips) that are especially painful when pressed. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after adequate sleep; often “sleep‑deprived” despite sleeping 7–9 hours. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Trouble falling or staying asleep, non‑refreshing sleep, or “sleep apnea”‑like symptoms. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Mood changes** | Higher rates of anxiety, depression, and irritability. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, and sensitivity to light, sound, or temperature. |\n\n---\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n\n- **Genetics**: Family history increases risk.\n- **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger or worsen symptoms.\n- **Infections**: Some viral or bacterial infections precede onset.\n- **Trauma**: Physical injury or emotional trauma can precipitate fibromyalgia.\n- **Sleep disorders**: Poor sleep quality can exacerbate pain.\n\nThe exact mechanism isn’t fully understood, but it involves:\n\n- **Central sensitization**: The brain and spinal cord become hypersensitive to pain signals.\n- **Neurochemical imbalances**: Altered levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and substance P.\n- **Hormonal dysregulation**: Stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) may be abnormal.\n\n---\n\n### Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical criteria**: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria require widespread pain for ≥3 months and tenderness in ≥11 of 18 specific points.\n- **Exclusion of other conditions**: Blood tests, imaging, and other evaluations rule out rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Treatment\n\n| Approach | What it does |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Medications** | *Pain relievers* (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), *antidepressants* (duloxetine, milnacipran), *anticonvulsants* (gabapentin, pregabalin). |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Regular aerobic exercise, stretching, yoga, tai chi. |\n| **Sleep hygiene** | Consistent bedtime routine, limiting caffeine/alcohol, treating sleep apnea if present. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps manage pain perception and coping strategies. |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening, posture correction, and pain‑relief techniques. |\n| **Complementary therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, mindfulness meditation, biofeedback. |\n| **Support groups** | Peer support and education. |\n\n---\n\n### Prognosis\n\n- Fibromyalgia is a **chronic** condition; symptoms can fluctuate.\n- With a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and therapy, many people achieve significant relief and improved quality of life.\n- Ongoing research is exploring new treatments targeting central pain pathways and neuroinflammation.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nFibromyalgia is a complex, chronic pain syndrome that affects the nervous system’s processing of pain, leading to widespread discomfort, fatigue, and cognitive issues. While there’s no cure, a multimodal treatment plan can help manage symptoms and improve daily functioning."

      "question": "What is plastic made of ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Plastic is made from long chains of molecules called polymers.**  \nThese polymers are built from small building blocks (monomers) that are chemically bonded together in a repeating pattern. The most common monomers and resulting polymers are:\n\n| Monomer | Polymer (plastic) | Typical use |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Ethylene | Polyethylene (PE) | Plastic bags, bottles, containers |\n| Propylene | Polypropylene (PP) | Food containers, automotive parts |\n| Styrene | Polystyrene (PS) | Foam cups, insulation |\n| Vinyl chloride | Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) | Pipes, siding, vinyl flooring |\n| Terephthalic acid + ethylene glycol | Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) | Beverage bottles, polyester fibers |\n| Acrylonitrile + butadiene + styrene | Acrylonitrile‑butadiene‑styrene (ABS) | Toys, automotive interiors |\n| Various | Polyurethane (PU) | Foam cushions, coatings |\n\n### How it’s made\n1. **Raw materials** – Usually petroleum‑derived hydrocarbons (oil or natural gas).  \n2. **Polymerization** – Monomers are linked together through chemical reactions (addition or condensation polymerization).  \n3. **Processing** – The molten polymer is shaped by extrusion, injection molding, blow‑molding, or other techniques.  \n4. **Additives** – Colorants, stabilizers, plasticizers, flame retardants, and fillers are mixed in to give the plastic desired properties.\n\n### Key points\n- **Not a single substance** – “Plastic” is a generic term for many different polymers.  \n- **Recyclable or not** – Some plastics (e.g., PET, HDPE) can be recycled; others (e.g., PVC, polystyrene foam) are harder to recycle.  \n- **Environmental impact** – Because most plastics are derived from fossil fuels and degrade slowly, waste management and recycling are major concerns.\n\nSo, plastic is essentially a synthetic material made from polymer chains built from simple hydrocarbon monomers, processed and combined with additives to create the wide variety of products we use every day."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Legally blind** is a legal definition used by governments, insurance companies, and disability programs to determine eligibility for benefits, services, and accommodations.  \nThe exact criteria vary by country, but the most common standard (U.S. and many other jurisdictions) is:\n\n| Criterion | Threshold | What it means |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | **20/200 or worse** in the better eye, even with corrective lenses | You can see at 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see at 200 ft. |\n| **Or visual field** | **Less than 20°** (i.e., a “tunnel vision” of 20 degrees or less) | The area you can see without moving your eyes is very narrow. |\n\nIf **either** of these conditions is met, the person is considered legally blind.  \nIn practice:\n\n1. **Best-corrected visual acuity** is measured with a Snellen chart (or equivalent).  \n2. **Visual field** is tested with a perimeter (e.g., Humphrey or Goldmann).  \n\n### Why the two measures?\n\n- **Acuity** captures sharpness of vision (e.g., a cataract).  \n- **Field** captures loss of peripheral vision (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma).  \n\n### Other common definitions\n\n| Country | Typical threshold |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Canada** | 20/200 or visual field < 20° |\n| **UK** | 20/200 or visual field < 20° (or 20/400 in the better eye) |\n| **Australia** | 20/200 or visual field < 20° |\n| **EU** | 20/200 or visual field < 20° (often used for disability benefits) |\n\n### Practical implications\n\n- **Eligibility for services**: Vision‑screening programs, low‑vision aids, transportation subsidies, and disability benefits.  \n- **Legal rights**: Accessibility requirements (e.g., wheelchair ramps, Braille signage).  \n- **Insurance**: Some health plans use the definition to determine coverage for low‑vision devices.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA person is legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity is 20/200 or worse in the better eye, or if their visual field is narrower than 20 degrees. This standard is widely used in the U.S. and many other countries to determine eligibility for assistance and accommodations."

In other words, the interest “compounds” or “re‑invests” itself, so each period you earn interest on a larger amount.\n\n### How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example |\n|------|--------------|---------|\n| **1. Start with a principal** | The initial amount of money you invest or borrow. | $1,000 |\n| **2. Apply the interest rate** | The rate (e.g., 5 % per year). | 5 % of $1,000 = $50 |\n| **3.

      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why do we need hybridization?\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have different shapes and energies.  \n- In many molecules, the observed bond angles and shapes (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal‑planar, linear) cannot be explained by a single type of orbital.  \n- Hybridization provides a way to combine orbitals of the same atom into new orbitals that are **spatially equivalent** and match the observed geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The basic idea\n\n1. **Take the valence orbitals** of an atom (e.g., 1 s, 2 p).  \n2. **Mix** them mathematically to create new orbitals that are linear combinations of the originals.  \n3. **Use** these new orbitals to form σ‑bonds (and sometimes π‑bonds) with other atoms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common hybridization types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example molecule |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal‑planar (120°) | BF₃, ethylene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal‑bipyramidal (120°, 90°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n> **Note:** The “d” orbitals are used only when the central atom is in the third period or higher (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur).\n\n---\n\n## 4. How hybridization works (simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count its valence electrons.  \n2. **Determine the number of σ‑bonds** (and lone pairs) it forms.  \n3. **Assign hybrid orbitals**:  \n   - 1 σ‑bond → sp  \n   - 2 σ‑bonds → sp²  \n   - 3 σ‑bonds → sp³  \n   - 4 σ‑bonds → sp³d  \n   - 5 σ‑bonds → sp³d²  \n4. **Place lone pairs** in the remaining hybrid orbitals.  \n5. **Draw the geometry** using the hybrid orbitals as axes.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons → 4 σ‑bonds with H.  \n- Hybridization: **sp³** (1 s + 3 p).  \n- Geometry: tetrahedral, 109.5°.  \n- Each C–H bond is formed by overlap of a C sp³ orbital with an H 1s orbital.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Hybridization vs. Molecular Orbital Theory\n\n- **Hybridization** is a *localized* model (focuses on individual atoms).  \n- **Molecular orbital (MO) theory** treats electrons as delocalized over the whole molecule.  \n- For many simple molecules, both models give the same geometry predictions, but MO theory is more accurate for larger, conjugated systems.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick “cheat sheet”\n\n| Bonding situation | Hybridization | Bond angle | Typical shape |\n|-------------------|---------------|------------|---------------|\n| 2 bonds + 2 lone pairs | sp | 180° | Linear (e.g., BeCl₂) |\n| 3 bonds + 1 lone pair | sp² | 120° | Trigonal‑planar (e.g., BF₃) |\n| 4 bonds | sp³ | 109.5° | Tetrahedral (e.g., CH₄) |\n| 5 bonds | sp³d | 90°/120° | Trigonal‑bipyramidal (e.g., PCl₅) |\n| 6 bonds | sp³d² | 90° | Octahedral (e.g., SF₆) |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a useful conceptual tool that explains how atoms form bonds with specific geometries by mixing their atomic orbitals into new, equivalent orbitals. It’s especially handy for predicting shapes of molecules in organic chemistry and for understanding the bonding in many inorganic compounds."

        "**Alcohol is absorbed very quickly – most of it enters the bloodstream within the first hour after you start drinking.**  \n\n| What happens | Typical timing | What it means for you |\n|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **Absorption from the stomach** | 10–30 % of the drink is absorbed in the stomach (especially if the drink is high‑concentration or taken on an empty stomach). | The first “hit” is felt almost immediately. |\n| **Absorption from the small intestine** | The remaining 70–90 % is absorbed in the small intestine. | By 30–60 minutes after you finish a drink, almost all of the alcohol has entered the blood. |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | 30–90 minutes after the start of drinking (often 45–60 min). | This is when you’ll feel the strongest effects. |\n| **Rate of absorption** | Roughly 0.1–0.2 g of alcohol per kilogram of body weight per hour under normal conditions. | For a 70‑kg adult, that’s about 7–14 g of alcohol per hour (≈ 0.1–0.2 g kg⁻¹ h⁻¹). |\n| **Factors that slow absorption** | Food in the stomach, alcohol concentration, rate of drinking, body weight, gender, genetics, medications. | A full stomach can delay peak BAC by 30–60 minutes. |\n| **Factors that speed absorption** | High‑concentration drinks (e.g., spirits), rapid sipping, alcohol‑containing mixers, certain medications. | A “shot” of 40 % ABV can raise BAC faster than a beer of the same volume. |\n\n### Quick take‑away\n\n- **Within the first 30–60 minutes** you’ll have absorbed ~90 % of the alcohol you drank.  \n- **Peak effects** usually occur 45–60 minutes after you start drinking.  \n- **Absorption rate** is roughly 0.1–0.2 g of alcohol per kilogram of body weight per hour, but this can vary widely based on the factors above.\n\nSo, if you’re planning a night out, remember that the body is already working hard to absorb most of the alcohol long before you finish your last drink."

        "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It flows outward through the entire solar system at speeds ranging from about 300 km/s (slow wind) to over 800 km/s (fast wind).  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Composition** | Mostly ionized hydrogen (protons) and helium, with trace heavier ions and electrons. |\n| **Origin** | The Sun’s hot, ionized corona; particles are accelerated by magnetic fields and thermal pressure. |\n| **Speed** | 300–800 km/s (≈ 1,000–2,800 mph). |\n| **Effects** | • Shapes planetary magnetospheres (e.g., Earth’s auroras). <br>• Drives space weather, affecting satellites, GPS, power grids. <br>• Interacts with the interstellar medium, creating the heliopause. |\n| **Measurement** | Detected by spacecraft (e.g., ACE, WIND, Parker Solar Probe) and ground‑based magnetometers. |\n| **Why it matters** | Solar wind carries the Sun’s magnetic field (the heliospheric magnetic field) and modulates cosmic ray fluxes; it’s a key driver of space‑weather phenomena. |\n\nIn short, solar wind is the Sun’s “solar breeze” of ionized particles that permeates the solar system and influences planetary environments and space‑based technology."

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar cells** (also called **photovoltaic cells**) are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. They do this by using the photovoltaic effect, where photons from the sun knock electrons loose from atoms in a semiconductor material, creating a flow of electric current.\n\n### How they work\n1. **Semiconductor material** – Most solar cells use silicon (single‑crystal or polycrystalline). The silicon is doped with impurities to create two layers:\n   * **n‑type** (extra electrons)\n   * **p‑type** (missing electrons, or “holes”)\n2. **p‑n junction** – When the two layers meet, an electric field forms at the junction, pushing electrons toward the n‑side and holes toward the p‑side.\n3. **Light absorption** – Sunlight hits the cell, photons excite electrons, creating electron‑hole pairs.\n4. **Current flow** – The internal electric field drives electrons out of the cell through an external circuit, producing usable DC power. The holes move in the opposite direction, completing the circuit inside the cell.\n\n### Key characteristics\n| Feature | Typical value |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Efficiency** | 15–22 % for commercial silicon panels (higher for specialized cells). |\n| **Voltage** | ~0.5–0.6 V per cell (a typical panel contains 60–72 cells in series). |\n| **Current** | Depends on light intensity; a 300‑W panel might produce ~5 A at full sun. |\n| **Lifetime** | 25–30 years with minimal degradation (~0.5 % per year). |\n\n### Types of solar cells\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Monocrystalline** | Made from a single crystal of silicon; highest efficiency, more expensive. |\n| **Polycrystalline** | Made from multiple silicon crystals; slightly lower efficiency, cheaper. |\n| **Thin‑film** | Uses layers of semiconductor materials (CdTe, CIGS, amorphous silicon) on flexible substrates; lower cost, lower efficiency. |\n| **Perovskite** | Emerging technology with rapidly improving efficiencies; still in development. |\n\n### Applications\n* **Residential and commercial rooftop panels** – Provide electricity for homes and businesses.  \n* **Utility‑scale solar farms** – Large arrays that feed power into the grid.  \n* **Portable devices** – Solar chargers, solar-powered calculators, etc.  \n* **Spacecraft** – Solar panels power satellites and space probes.  \n\n### Why they matter\nSolar cells are a key component of renewable energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, lowering greenhouse‑gas emissions, and providing a clean, inexhaustible power source."

        "**Severance pay** is a payment (or series of payments) that an employer gives to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually because of a layoff, termination, or a company restructuring. It’s intended to help the employee transition to new work or cover living expenses while they look for a new job.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Typical details |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Purpose** | Provide financial support during the period between jobs; can also serve as a goodwill gesture or part of a settlement. |\n| **How it’s calculated** | • **Time‑based**: e.g., one week’s pay for every year of service. <br>• **Fixed amount**: a lump sum agreed upon in a contract or severance agreement. <br>• **Combination**: a base amount plus a per‑month or per‑year component. |\n| **Legal requirements** | • In the U.S., there’s no federal law mandating severance pay, but some states (e.g., California) require it in certain circumstances. <br>• In other countries, severance may be required by law or collective bargaining agreements. |\n| **Tax treatment** | Usually treated as ordinary income and subject to withholding, though some jurisdictions allow tax‑deferred arrangements if the payment is part of a qualified plan. |\n| **Typical duration** | Often 1–6 months of pay, but can be longer for senior executives or in negotiated settlements. |\n| **Other benefits** | Severance packages may also include continued health‑insurance coverage, outplacement services, or a letter of recommendation. |\n\nIn short, severance pay is a financial cushion the employer offers when an employee’s job ends, helping them bridge the gap until they find new employment."

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Semiconductors** are materials that conduct electricity better than insulators but not as well as metals. Their electrical conductivity can be precisely controlled by adding impurities (doping) or by changing temperature, light, or electric fields. This tunability makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n### Key characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Band gap** | A small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can jump across this gap with a modest amount of energy. |\n| **Doping** | Introducing small amounts of other elements (e.g., phosphorus or boron in silicon) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or “holes” (p‑type), enabling control of charge carriers. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common are crystalline silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), but many others exist (GaAs, SiC, InP, etc.). |\n\n### Why they matter\n\n1. **Transistors** – The fundamental building block of all digital electronics. A single transistor can act as a switch or amplifier.  \n2. **Integrated circuits (ICs)** – Millions of transistors packed onto a single chip (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, memory).  \n3. **Photovoltaics** – Solar cells use semiconductor junctions to convert light into electricity.  \n4. **Sensors & LEDs** – Semiconductors produce light (LEDs) or detect light, heat, pressure, etc.  \n5. **Communication** – RF and optical communication devices rely on semiconductor diodes and lasers.\n\n### Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | CMOS logic, memory, solar cells | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | High‑speed transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | RF, microwave, laser diodes | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 3.26 |\n| **Indium Phosphide (InP)** | Optoelectronics, high‑speed lasers | 1.35 |\n\n### How a semiconductor works (simplified)\n\n1. **p‑n junction** – Two regions (p‑type and n‑type) are joined.  \n2. **Depletion zone** – Electrons from the n‑side recombine with holes from the p‑side, creating a region with no free charge carriers.  \n3. **Biasing** – Applying a voltage across the junction controls the flow of carriers:  \n   * **Forward bias** (p‑side positive) allows current to flow.  \n   * **Reverse bias** (p‑side negative) blocks current, except for a tiny leakage current.  \n\nThis behavior underpins diodes, transistors (BJT, MOSFET), and many other devices.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Semiconductors are engineered materials whose conductivity can be finely tuned, enabling the creation of virtually all modern electronic devices—from microprocessors to solar panels."

The term comes from the Hebrew word *shiva* (שִׁבְעָה), meaning “seven.” It refers to the seven‑day period of intense mourning during which the family and close friends gather to grieve, receive visitors, and receive support.\n\n### Key aspects of Sitting Shiva\n\n| Element | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Duration** | 7 consecutive days (sometimes 7 nights) following the burial. |\n| **Location** | Usually in the home of the deceased’s immediate family (often the mother’s house). |\n| **Participants** | Close relatives (parents, siblings, children, grandparents) and close friends. |\n| **Activities** | • Visitors come to offer condolences and share memories. <br>• The mourners sit on low stools or cushions, often in a circle. <br>• The mourners may refrain from certain activities (e.g., no music, no television, no haircuts). |\n| **Prayers** | The mourners recite the *Kaddish* (a prayer praising God) and other liturgical prayers. |\n| **Purpose** | To honor the deceased, provide emotional support, and allow the mourners to process grief in a communal setting. |\n\n### Cultural context\n\n- **Timing**: The Shiva begins the day after the burial and ends the day before the 7th day’s evening.  \n- **Visitors**: Friends, neighbors, and community members often bring food, flowers, or condolence cards.  \n- **Observances**: Some families observe additional customs, such as wearing a black armband or a *kittel* (white mourning garment) on the 7th day.  \n\nIn short, “Sitting Shiva” is a seven‑day period of mourning in which the bereaved family gathers with friends and community to grieve, receive support, and honor the life of the deceased."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a prion, which accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, “mushy” texture (hence the name “spongiform”).  \n\n### Key facts\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Cause** | Misfolded prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) that induces normal prion proteins to misfold. |\n| **Transmission in cattle** | Usually through contaminated feed (e.g., protein meal from infected animals). |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Ataxia (loss of coordination), weight loss, behavioral changes, and eventually death (typically 6–12 months after onset). |\n| **Human risk** | **Variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**, a rare but fatal brain disorder, can be contracted by eating infected beef products. |\n| **Control measures** | Strict feed‑ban laws, surveillance of herds, removal of high‑risk tissues (brain, spinal cord), and culling of infected animals. |\n| **Economic impact** | Major losses in the beef industry, trade restrictions, and public‑health costs. |\n\n### How it spreads to humans\n\n- **Consumption of infected beef**: The prion can survive cooking and is resistant to standard sterilization.  \n- **Incubation period**: In humans, vCJD can take 5–20 years to manifest after exposure.  \n- **Symptoms in humans**: Rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, and eventually death within 1–2 years of symptom onset.\n\n### Prevention\n\n- **Feed bans**: Prohibit the use of animal protein in cattle feed.  \n- **Testing**: Routine testing of cattle, especially those showing neurological signs.  \n- **Traceability**: Monitoring of the supply chain to ensure contaminated tissues are removed.  \n- **Public education**: Informing consumers about safe beef handling and cooking practices.\n\nMad cow disease is a classic example of a **prion disease**—a class of disorders caused by misfolded proteins rather than viruses or bacteria. It underscores the importance of animal‑to‑human disease transmission and the need for stringent food‑safety regulations."

        "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is mainly hydrocarbons, but the exact mix varies with the field and the depth of the deposit.  The typical composition (by volume) is:\n\n| Component | Typical range | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; the “fuel” that gives natural gas its energy content. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | A heavier hydrocarbon that can be separated for use as a feedstock for plastics. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Often recovered as a by‑product; used for heating and as a vehicle fuel. |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Includes both normal and iso‑butane; used in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and as a gasoline additive. |\n| **Other heavier hydrocarbons** (pentanes, hexanes, etc.) | < 1 % | Usually present in trace amounts. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; can reduce the heating value if present in high amounts. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; removed in many processing plants to improve energy content. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.1 % (often < 0.01 %) | Toxic and corrosive; must be removed before distribution. |\n| **Water vapor (H₂O)** | < 0.5 % | Condensed out during processing. |\n| **Trace gases** (e.g., helium, neon, argon, methane‑derived gases) | < 0.1 % | Usually negligible for energy calculations. |\n\n### Why the composition matters\n\n- **Energy content**: Methane has the highest heating value per unit volume; heavier hydrocarbons add more energy but also require separation.\n- **Processing**: Nitrogen, CO₂, H₂S, and water must be removed to meet pipeline specifications and to avoid corrosion or toxicity.\n- **Market value**: Ethane, propane, and butanes are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks or as fuels in their own right.\n\nIn short, natural gas is a mixture dominated by methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons, nitrogen, CO₂, and trace impurities that are managed during processing before the gas reaches homes, industry, or power plants."

        "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Why it’s yellow | What’s really happening |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | The Sun actually emits almost *white* light (a mix of all visible wavelengths). As that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering). The longer‑wavelength yellow, orange, and red photons travel straight to your eye, so the Sun appears yellowish. |\n| **Human eye sensitivity** | Our eyes are most sensitive to green‑yellow light. When the Sun’s light is filtered by the atmosphere, the remaining spectrum is weighted toward the yellow‑green part of the spectrum, so we perceive it as yellow. |\n| **Time of day** | At noon, when the Sun is high in the sky, the path through the atmosphere is shortest, so the scattering is minimal and the Sun looks more white. In the morning or evening, the light passes through more atmosphere, scattering more blue light and making the Sun appear more orange‑red. |\n| **Weather and pollution** | Dust, smoke, or pollution can increase scattering, making the Sun look even more yellow or orange. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is not actually yellow; it shines white. The yellow appearance is a result of atmospheric scattering and the way our eyes perceive the remaining light."

        "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many other livestock).  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | A picornavirus of the *Pestivirus* genus (seven serotypes: O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, equipment, or people; airborne spread over short distances; and via fomites (vehicles, clothing, etc.). |\n| **Clinical signs** | Fever, lameness, and the hallmark “foot” lesions: vesicles (blisters) that rupture into painful ulcers on the hooves, teats, and mouth. Infected animals may also show swelling of the tongue and mouth, reduced milk production, and weight loss. |\n| **Affected species** | Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, antelope, and many other cloven‑hooved species. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses from decreased milk and meat production, trade restrictions, culling of infected animals, and costs of vaccination and biosecurity. |\n| **Control measures** | Vaccination (often with inactivated virus), strict movement controls, culling of infected and exposed animals, quarantine, and biosecurity protocols. |\n| **Human health** | Not transmissible to humans; however, people can become infected with the virus if they handle infected animals or contaminated materials. |\n\nBecause of its rapid spread and severe economic consequences, FMD is a notifiable disease in many countries, and international trade in livestock and animal products is tightly regulated when outbreaks occur."

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound, then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal, a system can determine distance, shape, speed, and sometimes composition of the target.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Principle** | Sound travels through a medium (water, air, etc.). When it encounters an object, part of the wave reflects back. The sonar system sends a “ping” and records the echo. |\n| **Types** | • **Active sonar** – emits a pulse and listens for echoes.<br>• **Passive sonar** – only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships). |\n| **Applications** | • Navigation and depth sounding for ships and submarines.<br>• Detecting and tracking submarines, torpedoes, and other vessels.<br>• Mapping the seafloor (bathymetry).<br>• Sonar imaging for underwater archaeology, marine biology, and search‑and‑rescue.<br>• Sonar in consumer devices (e.g., “sonar” in some smartphones for proximity sensing). |\n| **How distance is calculated** | Distance = (Speed of sound in the medium × Time delay) ÷ 2. The division by 2 accounts for the round‑trip travel time. |\n| **Speed of sound** | Roughly 1,500 m/s in seawater (varies with temperature, salinity, depth). |\n| **Limitations** | • Sound absorption and scattering in water can limit range.<br>• Noise from ships, waves, and marine life can mask echoes.<br>• Requires careful calibration and interpretation. |\n\nIn short, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where sight is impossible."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain, tenderness, and a range of other symptoms. It’s not a single disease but a syndrome—meaning it’s a collection of signs and symptoms that tend to occur together.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain that affects both sides of the body and above and below the waist. It’s often described as a constant dull ache or “deep” pain. |\n| **Tender points** | Specific spots on the body (e.g., neck, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees) that are especially painful when pressed. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Trouble falling or staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, depression or anxiety, numbness/tingling, and sensitivity to temperature or noise. |\n\n---\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n\n- **Exact cause unknown** – likely a mix of genetics, stress, infections, or injuries that trigger abnormal pain processing in the brain and nervous system.\n- **Risk factors**: family history, female sex (about 80 % of people with fibromyalgia are women), certain infections, physical or emotional trauma, and other chronic pain conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical evaluation** – doctors look for pain lasting >3 months, widespread pain, and tender points.\n- **Exclusion of other conditions** – blood tests, imaging, or other tests to rule out arthritis, thyroid disease, etc.\n- **Criteria** – The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a combination of pain distribution, tender point count, and symptom severity.\n\n---\n\n### Treatment\n\nThere’s no single cure, but a combination of approaches can help:\n\n| Approach | What it does |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Medications** | Pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin). |\n| **Exercise** | Low‑impact activities (walking, swimming, yoga) improve pain and sleep. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps manage stress, coping strategies, and sleep hygiene. |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening, stretching, and posture training. |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Adequate sleep, stress reduction, balanced diet, and avoiding triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol). |\n| **Complementary therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, mindfulness meditation, and relaxation techniques. |\n\n---\n\n### Living with Fibromyalgia\n\n- **Track symptoms** – a diary of pain, sleep, and triggers can help identify patterns.\n- **Set realistic goals** – small, achievable steps in exercise or daily tasks.\n- **Seek support** – support groups, counseling, or patient education can reduce isolation.\n- **Regular check‑ins** – keep in touch with a rheumatologist or primary care provider to adjust treatment as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition that primarily causes widespread pain and fatigue. While the exact cause isn’t fully understood, it’s managed with a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and therapy. If you suspect you have fibromyalgia, a healthcare professional can evaluate your symptoms and guide you toward an individualized treatment plan."

The definition is set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA).  \n\n| Criterion | What it means | Typical measurement |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | The sharpness of vision in the better‑seeing eye, even after correction (glasses or contact lenses). | **20/200 or worse** (i.e., you see at 20 ft what a person with normal vision sees at 200 ft). |\n| **Visual field** | The total area you can see while looking straight ahead. | **Less than 20°** (a narrow “tunnel” of vision). |\n| **Both eyes** | The criteria must be met in the better eye; the other eye may be worse. | If the better eye is 20/200 or worse, or the visual field is <20°, the person is considered legally blind. |\n\n### How it’s used\n\n- **Eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**: A person must meet the visual acuity or visual field criteria (or both) to qualify for vision‑related disability benefits.  \n- **Access to services**: Schools, transportation, and other public programs often use the same definition to determine eligibility for accommodations.  \n- **Insurance and legal contexts**: Some insurance policies and legal statutes reference the same thresholds.\n\n### Quick reference\n\n- **20/200 visual acuity** = “20/200 vision” (or “20‑200” in some countries).  \n- **20° visual field** = “20‑degree field” (or “20‑degree visual field”).  \n\nIf you or someone you know meets either of these thresholds, the individual is considered **legally blind** for most legal and administrative purposes."

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n### How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example |\n|------|--------------|---------|\n| 1. **Deposit** | You put a principal amount \\(P\\) into an account. | $1,000 |\n| 2. **First period** | Interest \\(I_1 = P \\times r\\) is added. | $1,000 × 5\\% = $50 → $1,050 |\n| 3. **Second period** | Interest is calculated on the new balance \\(P + I_1\\). | $1,050 × 5\\% = $52.50 → $1,102.50 |\n| 4. **Repeat** | Each period’s interest is added to the balance, and the next period’s interest is calculated on that larger balance. | … |\n\nThe formula for compound interest after \\(n\\) periods (with interest rate \\(r\\) per period) is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + r\\right)^n\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = final amount (principal + interest)  \n- \\(P\\) = initial principal  \n- \\(r\\) = interest rate per period (expressed as a decimal)  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods\n\n### Key points\n\n| Feature | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Compounding frequency** | Interest can be compounded **annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, or continuously**. More frequent compounding yields a higher final balance. |\n| **Continuous compounding** | Uses the mathematical constant \\(e\\): \\(A = P e^{rt}\\). |\n| **Effective annual rate (EAR)** | The actual yearly return accounting for compounding frequency: \\( \\text{EAR} = (1 + r/m)^m - 1\\), where \\(m\\) is periods per year. |\n| **Benefit** | Over long periods, compound interest can turn modest savings into substantial wealth (the “time value of money”). |\n\n### Quick example\n\n- Principal: $5,000  \n- Annual rate: 4 %  \n- Compounded monthly (12 times a year)  \n- Time: 10 years  \n\n\\[\nA = 5{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 10}\n  \\approx 5{,}000 \\times 1.48024\n  \\approx \\$7{,}401.20\n\\]\n\nSo you’d end up with about $7,400 after 10 years, thanks to interest earning interest.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** Compound interest is the process where the interest you earn on an investment is reinvested, so that in the next period you earn interest on both the original principal and the accumulated interest. This “interest on interest” leads to exponential growth over time."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atoms form bonds by mixing (or “hybridizing”) their atomic orbitals into new, equivalent orbitals that are better suited for bonding.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why hybridization is useful\n\n- **Geometry**: The shape of a molecule (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal‑planar, linear) is determined by the arrangement of its bonding orbitals.  \n- **Energy**: Hybrid orbitals are of equal energy, making bonding more favorable.  \n- **Predictability**: It gives a simple way to predict bond angles and molecular shape.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The basic idea\n\nAn atom’s valence orbitals (s, p, d) can combine to form **hybrid orbitals**.  \nThe number of hybrid orbitals equals the number of orbitals that are mixed.\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals mixed | Number of hybrids | Typical geometry | Example |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | 2 | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | 3 | Trigonal‑planar (120°) | BF₃, ethylene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | 4 | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | 5 | Trigonal‑bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | 6 | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n*Note*: The “d” orbitals are used only for elements in the third period or higher.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How it works (simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom’s valence orbitals** (e.g., 2s, 2p for carbon).  \n2. **Count the regions of electron density** (bonds + lone pairs).  \n3. **Choose the hybridization** that matches that count.  \n4. **Form hybrid orbitals** that point toward the bonding partners.  \n5. **Use the hybrids to form σ‑bonds**; remaining p orbitals can form π‑bonds.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Common examples\n\n| Molecule | Central atom | Hybridization | Geometry | Bond angles |\n|----------|--------------|---------------|----------|-------------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | C | sp³ | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| **Ammonia (NH₃)** | N | sp³ | Trigonal‑pyramidal | 107° |\n| **Water (H₂O)** | O | sp³ | Bent | 104.5° |\n| **Ethylene (C₂H₄)** | C | sp² | Trigonal‑planar | 120° |\n| **Boron trifluoride (BF₃)** | B | sp² | Trigonal‑planar | 120° |\n| **Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅)** | P | sp³d | Trigonal‑bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Hybridization vs. other “hybridization” terms\n\n| Field | What “hybridization” means |\n|-------|----------------------------|\n| **Chemistry** | Mixing of atomic orbitals to form hybrid orbitals. |\n| **Genetics** | Cross‑breeding of two different species or varieties. |\n| **Linguistics** | Mixing of two languages or dialects. |\n| **Engineering** | Combining two technologies or systems (e.g., hybrid cars). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization in chemistry is a model that explains how atoms rearrange their valence orbitals to form bonds that give molecules their observed shapes and bond angles. It’s a cornerstone of molecular geometry and helps chemists predict and rationalize the structure of countless compounds."

        "**How fast alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream**\n\n| Stage | Typical time frame | What happens |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Ingestion** | 0 min | Alcohol enters the mouth, then the esophagus. |\n| **Stomach absorption** | 5–30 min | Roughly 10–20 % of the drink is absorbed here. The rate depends on stomach contents (food slows it). |\n| **Small‑intestine absorption** | 30–90 min | The bulk (≈ 80–90 %) of alcohol is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum. |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | 30–90 min after drinking | Most people reach their highest BAC within this window. |\n| **Metabolism** | 1–2 hours | The liver metabolizes ~90 % of ingested alcohol at a fairly constant rate (~0.015 % BAC per hour in an average adult). |\n\n### Key points\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption speed |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Food in stomach** | Delays absorption (slower rise in BAC). |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑proof drinks (e.g., spirits) reach peak BAC faster than beer or wine. |\n| **Body weight & sex** | Smaller or female bodies reach higher BACs more quickly. |\n| **Rate of drinking** | Rapid consumption (e.g., “binge” drinking) can saturate the stomach, pushing more alcohol into the small intestine quickly. |\n| **Alcohol type** | Spirits (40 % ABV) → peak in ~30 min; wine (12–14 % ABV) → peak in ~45–60 min; beer (4–6 % ABV) → peak in ~60–90 min. |\n\n### Rough “rule of thumb”\n\n- **1 standard drink** (≈ 14 g of pure alcohol) raises BAC by ~0.02 % in a 70‑kg adult.\n- **Peak BAC** usually occurs **30–60 min** after the first drink, but can be as early as 15 min for very high‑proof drinks or as late as 90 min for low‑proof drinks.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAlcohol is absorbed relatively quickly—most of it enters the bloodstream within the first hour after drinking. The exact speed depends on how fast you drink, what you’re drinking, whether you’ve eaten, and individual physiological factors."

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar cells** (also called photovoltaic cells) are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. They do this by using the photovoltaic effect, where photons from the sun knock electrons loose from atoms in a semiconductor material, creating an electric current.\n\n### How they work\n\n| Step | What happens | Key component |\n|------|--------------|---------------|\n| 1. **Absorption** | Sunlight (photons) hits the cell. | Semiconductor (usually silicon). |\n| 2. **Electron excitation** | Photons give energy to electrons, freeing them. | P‑type and N‑type layers. |\n| 3. **Separation** | Electrons move to the N‑type side, holes to the P‑type side, creating a voltage difference. | Junction (p‑n junction). |\n| 4. **Current flow** | The voltage pushes electrons through an external circuit, producing usable electric current. | External load (lamp, battery charger, etc.). |\n| 5. **Return** | Electrons recombine with holes in the cell, completing the circuit. | Back contact. |\n\n### Types of solar cells\n\n| Type | Material | Typical efficiency | Common use |\n|------|----------|--------------------|------------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon** | Single‑crystal silicon | 18–22 % | Residential panels, high‑performance applications |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon** | Multi‑crystal silicon | 15–18 % | Commercial panels, cost‑effective installations |\n| **Thin‑film** | Amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIGS | 10–12 % | Building‑integrated photovoltaics, flexible panels |\n| **Perovskite** | Perovskite‑based compounds | 20–25 % (lab) | Emerging technology, potential for low‑cost, high‑efficiency cells |\n\n### Why they matter\n\n- **Renewable energy source**: No fuel consumption, no greenhouse‑gas emissions during operation.  \n- **Scalable**: From small rooftop panels to large utility‑scale solar farms.  \n- **Energy independence**: Reduces reliance on fossil fuels and grid power.  \n\n### Basic components of a solar‑panel system\n\n1. **Solar cells** – the active light‑to‑electricity converters.  \n2. **Encapsulation** – protects cells from weather (glass, EVA, or other polymers).  \n3. **Frame** – usually aluminum, holds the panel together.  \n4. **Batteries** (optional) – store excess energy for use when the sun isn’t shining.  \n5. **Inverter** – converts the DC output of the cells into AC for household use.  \n\nIn short, a solar cell is a tiny, solid‑state device that turns photons into electrons, producing electricity that can power homes, businesses, and even entire communities."

        "**Severance pay** is a financial benefit that an employer may provide to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually through a layoff, termination, or mutual separation. It is intended to help the employee transition to new work or to cover living expenses while they search for a new job.\n\n### Key points\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Purpose** | Cushion the employee’s income loss, reduce the impact of sudden unemployment, and sometimes encourage a smooth transition or protect the company from potential litigation. |\n| **Typical form** | A lump‑sum payment or a series of regular payments (e.g., a set number of weeks or months of salary). |\n| **Eligibility** | Not guaranteed by law in most jurisdictions; depends on company policy, employment contracts, collective‑bargaining agreements, or state regulations. |\n| **Common triggers** | • Company‑wide layoffs or restructuring <br>• Redundancy or position elimination <br>• Voluntary resignation with a negotiated exit package <br>• Termination for cause (sometimes with reduced or no severance) |\n| **Components** | • Base salary or wages <br>• Pro‑rated benefits (e.g., unused vacation, bonuses) <br>• Possible additional perks (e.g., outplacement services, extended health insurance). |\n| **Tax treatment** | In many countries, severance pay is treated as taxable income, though some jurisdictions offer tax‑deferral or tax‑free allowances for certain severance amounts. |\n| **Legal considerations** | • **Employment contracts** may specify severance terms. <br>• **Collective bargaining agreements** often set minimum severance. <br>• **State or national laws** (e.g., California’s “severance” rules, UK’s statutory redundancy pay) may impose minimum requirements. |\n| **Negotiation** | Employees can negotiate severance terms, especially if they have a strong bargaining position or if the company wants to avoid litigation. |\n| **Typical duration** | Varies widely: from a few weeks to several months, or even a year, depending on the role, seniority, and company policy. |\n\n### Example\n\nA senior manager who is laid off might receive:\n\n- **Base salary**: $8,000 per month × 6 months = $48,000  \n- **Unused vacation**: $5,000  \n- **Health‑insurance continuation**: 6 months of coverage  \n- **Outplacement services**: $2,000  \n\nTotal severance package: **$55,000** (plus benefits).\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSeverance pay is a negotiated or contractual payment that helps employees bridge the gap between jobs, providing financial support during a period of transition. It is not a legal requirement everywhere, but many companies offer it as part of their employment policies or to mitigate potential legal disputes."

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Semiconductors** are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass). Their conductivity can be precisely controlled and altered by adding impurities (doping), applying electric fields, or changing temperature, making them the foundation of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | Semiconductors have a small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can be excited across this gap with modest energy, allowing the material to conduct. |\n| **Doping** | Introducing a few atoms of a different element (e.g., phosphorus or boron in silicon) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type). This changes the number of charge carriers dramatically. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | As temperature rises, more electrons jump the band gap, increasing conductivity. This is opposite to metals, whose conductivity decreases with heat. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs) have a crystalline lattice that supports well‑defined electronic bands. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical band gap (eV) | Common use |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | 1.12 | CMOS ICs, solar cells, power devices |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | 0.66 | Early transistors, infrared detectors |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | 1.43 | High‑speed RF, LEDs, laser diodes |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | 3.26 | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices |\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | 3.4 | LEDs, high‑frequency power amplifiers |\n| **Indium Phosphide (InP)** | 1.35 | Optoelectronics, fiber‑optic communications |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | Principle | Key semiconductor role |\n|--------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction allows current in one direction | p‑type and n‑type doping |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Controls current flow via gate/base | Precise doping, thin oxide layers |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Many transistors on one chip | Silicon wafers, photolithography |\n| **Solar cell** | Photovoltaic effect | Silicon or thin‑film semiconductors |\n| **LED / Laser diode** | Electron‑hole recombination emits light | Direct band‑gap materials (GaAs, GaN) |\n| **Photodetector** | Light generates carriers | Silicon, InGaAs, etc. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Why semiconductors matter\n\n- **Miniaturization**: They allow billions of transistors on a single chip, enabling smartphones, computers, and IoT devices.  \n- **Energy efficiency**: Low‑power switching reduces heat and energy consumption.  \n- **Versatility**: From power electronics (electric vehicles) to optoelectronics (fiber‑optic networks).  \n- **Innovation driver**: Advances in semiconductor technology (Moore’s Law, 5 nm nodes) continue to push computing performance and cost.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| *What is a band gap?* | Energy difference between valence and conduction bands. |\n| *What is doping?* | Adding impurities to change carrier concentration. |\n| *Why is silicon dominant?* | Abundant, mature fabrication technology, good band gap. |\n| *Can semiconductors be made from non‑crystalline materials?* | Yes—amorphous silicon, organic semiconductors, perovskites. |\n| *What’s the future?* | 2‑D materials (graphene, MoS₂), silicon‑on‑insulator, quantum‑dot LEDs, and more efficient solar cells. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Semiconductors are engineered materials whose conductivity can be finely tuned, enabling the vast array of electronic devices that power modern life."

        "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called **hyphae**. When hyphae branch and intertwine, they form a network called a **mycelium**. Mold reproduces by producing spores that can be dispersed by air, water, or contact.\n\n---\n\n### Key characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Growth form** | Filamentous, often visible as fuzzy or powdery patches |\n| **Reproduction** | Asexual spores (conidia) or sexual spores (ascospores/zygospore) |\n| **Habitat** | Moist, organic‑rich environments (walls, wood, food, carpet, HVAC ducts) |\n| **Temperature range** | 10 °C – 40 °C (50 °F – 104 °F) – some species tolerate extremes |\n| **pH preference** | Slightly acidic to neutral (pH 4–7) |\n\n---\n\n### Common types of mold\n\n| Mold | Typical appearance | Common locations |\n|------|--------------------|------------------|\n| **Aspergillus** | Greenish‑brown, powdery | Damp walls, HVAC, food |\n| **Cladosporium** | Dark green or black | Damp wood, insulation, indoor air |\n| **Stachybotrys chartarum** (black mold) | Dark green/black, slimy | Water‑damaged drywall, carpet |\n| **Penicillium** | Blue‑green, fuzzy | Food, damp surfaces |\n| **Alternaria** | Dark brown/black, powdery | Damp walls, plants |\n\n---\n\n### Why mold matters\n\n| Issue | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Health** | Inhalation of spores can trigger allergies, asthma, or respiratory infections; some molds produce mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxin, ochratoxin). |\n| **Structural damage** | Hyphae can penetrate wood, drywall, and other building materials, weakening them over time. |\n| **Food spoilage** | Molds consume nutrients, rendering food unsafe or inedible. |\n| **Odor** | Many molds emit a musty, earthy smell. |\n\n---\n\n### Prevention & control\n\n1. **Control moisture**  \n   - Fix leaks, use dehumidifiers (target < 50 % RH).  \n   - Keep indoor temperatures stable (≈ 20–22 °C / 68–72 °F).  \n\n2. **Ventilation**  \n   - Use exhaust fans in bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry areas.  \n   - Ensure proper airflow in HVAC systems.  \n\n3. **Clean & dry**  \n   - Wipe down damp surfaces within 24 h.  \n   - Replace water‑damaged materials promptly.  \n\n4. **Use mold‑resistant products**  \n   - Mold‑resistant drywall, paints, and insulation.  \n\n5. **Professional remediation**  \n   - For large infestations (> 10 ft²) or when health symptoms arise, hire certified mold remediation specialists.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can mold be seen with the naked eye?** | Yes, it appears as fuzzy or powdery patches. |\n| **Do all molds produce toxins?** | Only certain species produce harmful mycotoxins. |\n| **Can you simply scrub mold away?** | Light surface mold can be cleaned with detergent, but hidden or extensive growth requires professional removal. |\n| **Is mold the same as mildew?** | Mildew is a type of mold that grows on damp surfaces; the terms are often used interchangeably but mildew is usually less invasive. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Mold is a filamentous fungus that thrives in moist, organic environments. While it plays a natural role in decomposition, indoor mold growth can damage structures and pose health risks, so controlling moisture and promptly addressing infestations are essential."

      "question": "What does `` Sitting Shiva '' mean ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Sitting Shiva** is a Jewish mourning practice that means “to sit in the house of grief.” It is the first week of mourning after a close relative’s death (usually a parent, spouse, child, or sibling).  \n\n### Key points\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Origin** | The term comes from the Hebrew word *shiva* (שִׁבְעָה), meaning “seven.” It refers to the seven‑day period of intense mourning. |\n| **Who sits?** | The immediate family of the deceased (parents, children, siblings, spouse). |\n| **What happens?** | The mourner sits in a designated space (often the home) and receives visitors who come to offer condolences, share memories, and provide support. |\n| **Typical customs** | • The mourner may wear a black shirt or a *kittel* (white robe). <br>• The house is dimmed; candles may be lit. <br>• Food is usually simple or not eaten at all during the first few days. <br>• Visitors bring food or bring their own to share. |\n| **Duration** | The formal “Sitting Shiva” lasts seven days, but the mourning period can extend to 30 days (for a parent) or 100 days (for a spouse). |\n| **Purpose** | To honor the deceased, allow the mourner to grieve, and receive communal support. |\n\n### How it’s observed\n\n1. **Preparation** – The family may set up a small table with a candle, a plate of food, and a place for visitors to sit.  \n2. **Visitors** – Friends, relatives, and community members come to offer condolences, share stories, and sometimes bring food.  \n3. **Mourning rituals** – The mourner may refrain from certain activities (e.g., no music, no celebrations) and may keep a low profile.  \n4. **End of the week** – After seven days, the formal sitting ends, but the mourner may continue to observe other mourning customs (e.g., *shloshim* for 30 days).\n\n### Cultural context\n\n- **Not a religious obligation** in the sense of a commandment, but a deeply rooted tradition in many Jewish communities worldwide.  \n- **Variations** – Some families keep the house closed to outsiders, while others welcome visitors. The level of observance can vary by community, age, and personal preference.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** “Sitting Shiva” is the Jewish practice of spending the first week after a close relative’s death in a period of mourning, where the mourner sits in a designated space, receives visitors, and observes customs that honor the deceased and support the grieving family."

      "question": "What is desktop publishing ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Desktop publishing (DTP)** is the process of creating printed or digital documents—such as books, magazines, brochures, flyers, newsletters, and web pages—using a personal computer and specialized software. It combines the functions of a word processor, graphic design, and layout tools, allowing a single user to design, edit, and produce professional‑quality materials without the need for a full‑time typesetter or printing house.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Core components\n\n| Component | What it does | Typical tools |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Text editing** | Compose and format body copy, headings, captions | Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign, Scribus |\n| **Graphic design** | Insert, edit, and position images, logos, icons | Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP |\n| **Layout & page design** | Arrange text, images, and other elements on a page, set margins, columns, and grids | InDesign, QuarkXPress, Affinity Publisher |\n| **Typography** | Choose fonts, set point size, leading, kerning, and tracking | Font libraries, Adobe Fonts, Google Fonts |\n| **Color management** | Define color palettes, use CMYK for print, RGB for screen | Pantone libraries, color swatches |\n| **File export** | Produce print‑ready PDFs, web‑optimized images, or e‑books | PDF/X, JPEG, PNG, EPUB |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Typical workflow\n\n1. **Planning** – Define the purpose, target audience, and content structure.  \n2. **Content creation** – Write text, gather images, and collect any other media.  \n3. **Design** – Set up a master page layout, choose fonts and colors, and place elements.  \n4. **Proofing** – Check for typos, layout errors, and color consistency.  \n5. **Export** – Generate a print‑ready PDF (CMYK, bleed, crop marks) or a digital file (PDF, EPUB, HTML).  \n6. **Print or publish** – Send to a printer or upload to a website, e‑book platform, or social media.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why it matters\n\n| Benefit | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Cost‑effective** | Eliminates the need for expensive typesetting or layout services. |\n| **Speed** | Rapid iteration and real‑time preview of changes. |\n| **Control** | Full creative freedom over typography, color, and layout. |\n| **Versatility** | Produces both print‑ready and digital‑ready outputs from the same file. |\n| **Accessibility** | Many free or low‑cost DTP programs (e.g., Scribus, Canva) make publishing accessible to small businesses, educators, and hobbyists. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Common uses\n\n| Medium | Typical DTP output |\n|--------|--------------------|\n| **Print** | Books, magazines, brochures, posters, business cards |\n| **Digital** | e‑books (EPUB), PDFs for download, newsletters, web graphics |\n| **Marketing** | Flyers, flyers, social media graphics, email templates |\n| **Education** | Worksheets, handouts, lesson plans, student projects |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Do I need a graphic designer?** | Not necessarily—basic DTP skills can be learned quickly, and many templates exist. |\n| **What’s the difference between DTP and publishing?** | DTP is the *design and layout* stage; publishing is the broader process that includes editing, printing, distribution, and marketing. |\n| **Can I use a word processor for DTP?** | Word processors can handle simple layouts, but dedicated DTP software offers more precise control over typography, page breaks, and print settings. |\n| **Is DTP still relevant with online publishing?** | Yes—many online publications still use DTP tools to create PDFs, e‑books, and print‑ready assets. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Desktop publishing turns a computer into a full‑featured design studio, letting anyone create polished, print‑ready or digital documents with professional layout, typography, and graphics—all from a single workstation."

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion** that accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, “spongiform” appearance of the tissue.\n\n### Key facts\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Cause** | Misfolded prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) that induces normal prion proteins to misfold. |\n| **Transmission in cattle** | Primarily through contaminated feed (e.g., protein meal from infected animals). |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Ataxia (loss of coordination), weight loss, behavioral changes, and eventually death (usually within 6–12 months). |\n| **Human risk** | **Variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**, a rare but invariably fatal brain disorder, can be contracted by eating infected beef products. |\n| **Incidence** | First identified in the UK in the 1980s; outbreaks have since been reported in several countries, but strict controls have dramatically reduced incidence. |\n| **Control measures** | • Ban on feeding cattle with animal protein.<br>• Surveillance and testing of herds.<br>• Removal and destruction of infected animals.<br>• Strict slaughter‑house inspections. |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Public health**: vCJD has a long incubation period (often 10–20 years) and is almost always fatal.  \n- **Economic impact**: Outbreaks can lead to trade bans, loss of consumer confidence, and significant costs to the livestock industry.  \n- **Scientific significance**: BSE was the first recognized prion disease, opening a new field of research into protein misfolding disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s).\n\n### Summary\n\nMad cow disease is a prion‑based neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can, through contaminated beef, cause a fatal brain disorder in humans. It is preventable through stringent feed‑regulation and surveillance programs."
