      "system_answer": "I don’t have the exact number of points you’ve earned, so I can’t give you a precise count of how many free nights you can redeem.  \nInstead, here’s a quick way to figure it out on your own:\n\n| Hilton Honors Category | Typical Points Needed (per night) | Notes |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| 1 | 5 000–10 000 | Lowest‑tier hotels |\n| 2 | 10 000–20 000 | |\n| 3 | 20 000–30 000 | |\n| 4 | 30 000–40 000 | |\n| 5 | 40 000–50 000 | Your Lake Las Vegas Resort is a Category 5 |\n| 6 | 50 000–60 000 | |\n| 7 | 60 000–70 000 | |\n| 8 | 70 000–80 000 | |\n| 9 | 80 000–90 000 | |\n|10 | 90 000–120 000 | Highest‑tier hotels (e.g., Waldorf Astoria) |\n\n**How to calculate:**\n\n1. **Check your points balance** – log in to Hilton Honors or look at your recent statement.  \n2. **Find the property’s category** – most Hilton sites list the category in the hotel details.  \n3. **Divide your points by the category’s point requirement** – that gives you the number of nights you can redeem.  \n   *Example:* If you have 120 000 points and the hotel is Category 5 (≈45 000 points/night), you can redeem 120 000 ÷ 45 000 ≈ **2.6 nights** → 2 full nights, with a little left over for a future stay or a partial redemption.  \n\n**Other factors that can affect the count**\n\n- **Peak vs. off‑peak pricing** – some hotels charge more points during busy periods.  \n- **Blackout dates** – certain dates may not be available for points redemption.  \n- **Promotions** – Hilton occasionally offers “points‑plus‑cash” or “double points” promotions that can change the effective cost.  \n\nIf you let me know your exact points balance and the specific Hilton property (or its category), I can give you a precise number of free nights you can redeem.",

      "system_answer": "In Borges’ short story **“The Library of Babel,”** he famously describes the library as an endless, labyrinthine space of hexagonal galleries. He writes:\n\n> “The Library is infinite, and its **center** is a point of infinite distance from any other point.  \n>  The **circumference** is infinite.”\n\nSo, according to Borges, the library has no conventional center or edge—its “center” is a point that is infinitely far away from everything else, and its circumference extends without bound.",

      "system_answer": "The cartoon I was referring to is **“The Great American Dream” (1970)**, an animated short produced by the Soviet studio **Soyuzmultfilm**.  \n\n**Why it’s a classic example of Soviet humor‑propaganda**\n\n| Feature | What it does | How it mocks Western culture |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Exaggerated “American” lifestyle** | The film shows a stereotypical American family living in a huge, shiny house, eating fast food, and driving a flashy car. | It exaggerates the idea that the West is all about excess, consumerism, and material wealth. |\n| **Contrast with Soviet values** | The Soviet family is shown in a modest apartment, eating simple, wholesome food, and enjoying communal activities. | The contrast highlights Soviet ideals of equality, community, and frugality. |\n| **Satirical narration** | The narrator describes the “American Dream” as a “miracle” that actually leads to emptiness and moral decay. | It ridicules the notion that Western prosperity automatically equals happiness. |\n| **Visual gags** | The American family’s house is so big that it’s literally a “house on a house” (a house on top of a house). | The absurdity underscores the perceived excess of Western life. |\n| **Ending** | The Soviet family watches the American family’s “dream” collapse, while the Soviet family smiles contentedly. | It suggests that the Soviet way of life is more stable and fulfilling. |\n\n**How it was used**\n\n- The short was shown in Soviet cinemas, on television, and at school screenings.  \n- It was part of a broader propaganda effort to promote Soviet values and to criticize Western consumerism.  \n- The humor—exaggerated caricatures, slapstick, and a light‑hearted tone—made the critique more palatable and memorable.\n\nSo, the cartoon you’re thinking of is **“The Great American Dream” (1970)**, a Soviet‑made satire that lampoons Western consumer culture while promoting Soviet ideals.",

      "system_answer": "Feeling stuck is a normal part of the creative cycle—especially when you’ve been pouring the same ideas into a canvas for a while. Below are a handful of practical, low‑commitment ways to spark fresh inspiration and get your brush moving again. Pick the ones that resonate most with you and mix them up as you go.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Change Your Reference Pool\n\n| Idea | Why it helps | Quick start |\n|------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Nature walks** | Fresh light, color, and texture | Take a 20‑min walk in a nearby park or garden. Photograph or sketch what catches your eye. |\n| **Museum or gallery visits** | Exposure to different styles and techniques | Plan a weekend trip to a local museum or a virtual tour of a world museum. |\n| **Street photography** | Urban textures, candid moments | Grab a disposable camera or your phone and walk a new neighborhood. |\n| **Food & drink** | Rich colors, patterns, and aroma | Paint a bowl of fruit, a steaming cup of coffee, or a vibrant cocktail. |\n| **People in motion** | Dynamic poses, gesture studies | Attend a dance class, watch a sports event, or sketch a busy café. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Experiment With New Mediums or Techniques\n\n| Medium/Technique | What it adds | How to try it |\n|------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Watercolor washes** | Soft, translucent layers | Paint a simple still life with watercolor to see how light behaves. |\n| **Mixed media collage** | Texture, depth | Combine paper, fabric, and paint on a canvas. |\n| **Palette knife impasto** | Bold, tactile surface | Try a single color or a limited palette to focus on texture. |\n| **Digital painting** | Instant feedback, layering | Use a tablet app (Procreate, Krita) for quick experiments. |\n| **Monochrome studies** | Focus on value & composition | Paint a scene using only shades of one color. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Re‑visit Old Work\n\n| Approach | Why it works | How to do it |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Re‑paint a favorite piece** | You already know the subject; new ideas can surface | Use a different color scheme or add a new element. |\n| **Create a series** | Consistency breeds new ideas | Pick a theme (e.g., “flowers in winter”) and paint 5–10 variations. |\n| **Add a twist** | Small changes can spark big shifts | Change the perspective, add a surreal element, or alter the lighting. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Collaborate or Share\n\n| Activity | Benefit | How to start |\n|----------|---------|--------------|\n| **Art swap** | Fresh eyes, new techniques | Find a local artist or online community to exchange works. |\n| **Group painting session** | Social energy, shared ideas | Host a “paint‑and‑sip” night with friends. |\n| **Online challenges** | Structured prompts, deadlines | Join a 30‑day challenge on Instagram or Reddit. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Use Prompt‑Based Inspiration\n\n| Prompt | Example | How to use |\n|--------|---------|------------|\n| **“What if…”** | What if a city were underwater? | Sketch a quick concept, then develop it. |\n| **“Color of the day”** | A deep teal | Paint a landscape or still life dominated by that hue. |\n| **“Emotion board”** | Joy, melancholy, curiosity | Create a collage of images, colors, and textures that evoke the feeling. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Take a Break (but stay engaged)\n\n| Activity | Why it helps | How to do it |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Mindful walk** | Clears mental clutter | Walk for 10–15 min, focusing on breath and surroundings. |\n| **Read a book** | New narratives inspire visual ideas | Pick a novel or art book that resonates. |\n| **Listen to music** | Sets mood, sparks visual associations | Create a playlist of songs that match the vibe you want to paint. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Set a Mini‑Goal\n\n| Goal | Example | Why it matters |\n|------|---------|----------------|\n| **30‑minute sketch** | Sketch a flower for 30 min | Keeps you moving without pressure. |\n| **One‑color painting** | Paint a landscape using only blues | Forces creative problem‑solving. |\n| **Daily photo** | Take a photo of something that catches your eye | Provides a ready reference for later. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Starter Pack” for Today\n\n1. **Grab a disposable camera or your phone.**  \n   Walk to a nearby park or café and take 5–10 photos of anything that feels interesting (light, pattern, color).\n\n2. **Choose one photo** and set a timer for 30 minutes.  \n   Paint it using a single color or a limited palette.  \n   Focus on capturing the mood rather than detail.\n\n3. **Afterward, write a short note**:  \n   *What did you feel?*  \n   *What surprised you?*  \n   *What would you like to explore next?*\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nCreativity is a conversation between you and the world. When you step outside your usual routine—whether that’s a new reference, a different medium, or a fresh perspective—you give your mind a chance to hear new ideas. Pick one or two of the suggestions above, give them a try, and let the process guide you back into the flow of painting. Happy creating!",
      "gold_answer": "The user would prefer responses that build upon their existing sources of inspiration, such as revisiting Instagram art accounts or exploring new techniques from online tutorials. They might also appreciate suggestions that revisit previous themes they found enjoyable, like painting flowers. The user would not prefer generic or vague suggestions for finding inspiration, and would likely appreciate responses that utilize their recent 30-day painting challenge experience.",
