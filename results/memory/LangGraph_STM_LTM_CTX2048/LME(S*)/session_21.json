Check out **Great Divide Brewing Co.**, **Denver Beer Co.**, or **Miller’s Brewing** for a quick tasting. |\n| **Day trip** | **Mount Evans or Rocky Mountain National Park** | If you have a few extra hours, a scenic drive up Mount Evans or a short hike in RMNP offers breathtaking views. |\n\n**Quick Tips**\n\n- **Public transit**: The RTD light rail and bus system are reliable; a 24‑hour pass is handy if you plan to hop around.\n- **Weather**: Denver can be unpredictable—layers are key. Bring a light jacket even in summer.\n- **Parking**: Street parking is limited; consider using a parking garage or the free “Park & Ride” lots near the light‑rail stations.\n\nEnjoy your Denver adventure!

Plan Your Itinerary\n\n| Day | Morning | Afternoon | Evening |\n|-----|---------|-----------|---------|\n| **Friday** | Arrive early (park opens 30–60 min before). Grab a quick breakfast at the park or a nearby café. | Hit the most popular rides first (use FastPass/Express if available). | Dinner at a themed restaurant (e.g., *Café 4* in Disney’s Hollywood Studios). |\n| **Saturday** | Start with a “soft” ride or show to warm up. | Explore a different area of the park or a second park if you’re in a multi‑park resort. | Nighttime show (fireworks, *Fantasmic!* or *Happily Ever After*). |\n| **Sunday** | Early morning: revisit a favorite or catch a ride you missed. | Pack up, grab lunch, and head home. | Optional: a quick stop at a local attraction or a scenic drive back. |\n\n> **Pro tip:** Use the park’s mobile app to check wait times, show schedules, and mobile ordering for food.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Maximize Your Time & Money\n\n| Strategy | How to Do It |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **FastPass / Express** | Book in advance (most parks allow 24‑hour booking). |\n| **Early Entry** | Some hotels offer early park entry—book a stay if you’re staying overnight. |\n| **Mobile Food Ordering** | Skip lines at quick‑service restaurants. |\n| **Park Hopper** | If you’re visiting multiple parks, a hopper pass can save you time (and sometimes money). |",
