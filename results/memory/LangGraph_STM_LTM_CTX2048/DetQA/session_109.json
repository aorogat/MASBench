      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Determine its location by smell\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the killer’s key method of tracking victims was to spray a distinctive perfume on the victim’s belongings and body, creating a scent trail that could be followed even in a dark, winding cave. This scent‑based tracking—described as the killer’s “Ariadne’s thread”—allowed the murderer to locate Mr. Onizuka without relying on visual cues or footsteps. The same technique was employed when the killer sought Yasuhiko Fukuda: by detecting the perfume’s lingering odor, the killer could pinpoint Fukuda’s location. Thus, the killer found Yasuhiko Fukuda by using the scent trail rather than by learning the studio’s location from Noguchi, mapping the studio, or following footsteps.\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Has been sent from the post office to elsewhere, not in the mailbox.\",\"reasoning\":\"According to the investigation notes, the boss’s wife handed Sugawara two envelopes and stamps. The first letter was mailed and recovered in the mailbox, but the second one was never found there. The detectives noted that Sugawara had no unused envelopes or paper in his possession, implying he had already used the second envelope. The narrative indicates that the second letter was either handed over to the innkeeper for delivery or was sent to a different destination after the post office’s delayed service caused the first letter to remain in the mailbox. Because the police only recovered the mailbox contents, the logical conclusion is that the second letter was dispatched from the post office to another location and therefore did not appear in the mailbox.
