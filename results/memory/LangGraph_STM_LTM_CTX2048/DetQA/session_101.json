The Brandt couple\",\"reasoning\":\"The Brandt couple (Mr. and Mrs. Brand) are the immediate neighbors of the victim at 19 Wilbraham Crescent and are explicitly mentioned as suspects in the investigation. Their proximity to the crime scene and the fact that the victim was a stranger who came to the house make them directly related to the death, whereas Mrs. Hemm, the MacNamara couple, and Miss House are not implicated in the narrative.\"}",

Miss Martin Dale\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative surrounding Inna Brent’s murder, Miss Martin (often referred to as Miss Martin in the text) is repeatedly highlighted as a key suspect. She is implicated in the phone‑call plot, is suspected of orchestrating the encounter that led to the fatal strangulation, and is the only character among the options who is explicitly tied to the crime scene and the investigation.

Detective Harcourt\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the inspector (the detective) physically picks up the small travel clock bearing the label “Rosemary” and hands it to Miss Pemaroux.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Second wife of Brand\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative indicates that Mrs. Brand is the spouse of Mr. Brand, but the letter from Richard Hakast reveals that she had a first husband who died during the war and a second husband named Hilary Martinchel. This establishes her as the second wife of Mr. Brand, rather than a lawyer or a first‑time spouse. Therefore, the correct identification is that Mrs. Brand is the second wife of Brand.\"}",

The prosecutor believes an arrest warrant can be issued for Mrs. Brand, implying she is the killer.  No other option (Miss Pema Khodro, Mrs. Rival, or Mrs. Rumsfeld) is mentioned as a suspect in the narrative.  Therefore, the killer is identified as Mr. and Mrs. Brand.\"}",
