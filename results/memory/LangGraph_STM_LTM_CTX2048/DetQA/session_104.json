      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Abandoned and left behind\",\"reasoning\":\"The evening tea was delivered to Room 317 at 7:15 PM, but Ada Gransbury died before she could drink it.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. George Seippel\",\"reasoning\":\"Thomas Brineau was convinced he had seen a man claiming to be Richard Nix, but the man was actually an imposter. The narrative never identifies the imposter as Richard himself, Henry Nigges, or Samuel Kid.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. To conceal suicide\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the only room with an open window is Richard Nigges’s room (238). Poirot notes that the killer did not close the window, suggesting it was left open deliberately. The most plausible motive is to disguise the nature of the death—by keeping the window open, the scene could be misinterpreted as a natural or accidental death rather than a suicide. The other options (beneficial to the body, fleeing in a car, or making the room look cluttered) are not supported by the text.\"}",
