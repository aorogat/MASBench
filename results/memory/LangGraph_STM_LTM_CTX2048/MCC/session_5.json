      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Reason | What Happens | Why It Matters |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Earth’s Atmosphere** | Sunlight is a mix of all visible colors (a white spectrum). As it passes through the atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength light (blue, violet) is scattered in all directions by air molecules and tiny particles (Rayleigh scattering). | The scattered blue light is what we see from the sky, so the direct beam that reaches our eyes is depleted of blue and appears more yellow‑white. |\n| **Observer’s Position** | When the Sun is high in the sky (mid‑day), the light travels a shorter path through the atmosphere, so less scattering occurs and the Sun looks whiter. When it’s near the horizon (sunrise/sunset), the light travels through more atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving a stronger yellow‑red tint. | This explains why the Sun can look “pale” at noon and “golden” at sunrise/sunset. |\n| **Human Vision** | Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light. Even a small shift toward the yellow part of the spectrum can make the Sun appear yellowish to us. | The perception of color is partly a function of the eye’s photoreceptors. |\n| **Sun’s True Color** | The Sun’s surface (photosphere) emits light with a temperature of about 5,800 K, which is close to a “white” or slightly “yellowish‑white” color in the visible spectrum. | Astronomical observations (outside Earth’s atmosphere) show the Sun as essentially white. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun itself is not yellow; it emits white light. It appears yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters away the blue part of the spectrum, leaving a yellow‑white beam that reaches our eyes.",

      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many other livestock).  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | A picornavirus of the *Picornaviridae* family (FMD virus, FMDV). There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 104 °F) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, inside the mouth, and on the teats (in dairy cattle) <br>• Vesicles on the feet and hooves (hence the name) <br>• Lameness, difficulty chewing, and reduced milk production. <br>• In young animals, severe dehydration and death can occur. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from: <br>• Reduced milk and meat production <br>• Culling of infected animals <br>• Trade restrictions (countries often ban imports from FMD‑affected regions) <br>• Costs of vaccination, biosecurity, and surveillance. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Strict quarantine and movement controls <br>• Vaccination (live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines) – often required in endemic regions <br>• Biosecurity measures: disinfectants, controlled access to farms, and proper disposal of carcasses <br>• Rapid reporting and isolation of suspected cases. |\n| **Human health** | FMD is **not** transmissible to humans. Humans can handle infected animals or products safely if proper hygiene is observed. |\n| **Global status** | The disease is endemic in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It has caused major outbreaks in the UK (2001), the US (2004), and other countries, leading to significant economic losses. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of cloven‑hooved animals, leading to serious economic consequences for livestock producers worldwide.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media).  \n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission** – A sonar system emits a short burst of sound (a “ping”) into the water.  \n2. **Propagation** – The sound travels through the medium at a known speed (≈1,500 m/s in seawater).  \n3. **Reflection** – When the sound wave hits an object (e.g., a submarine, fish, or the seafloor), part of it is reflected back.  \n4. **Reception** – Hydrophones (underwater microphones) pick up the echo.  \n5. **Processing** – The time delay between transmission and reception, combined with the known sound speed, gives the distance to the target. The echo’s frequency shift (Doppler effect) can reveal the target’s speed and direction.\n\n### Types of Sonar\n| Type | Purpose | Typical Use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active sonar** | Emits sound and listens for echoes | Navigation, depth sounding, submarine detection |\n| **Passive sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects | Detecting ships, submarines, marine life |\n| **Imaging sonar** | Creates detailed images of objects or the seafloor | Underwater archaeology, mine detection |\n| **Side‑scan sonar** | Scans a wide area to produce a panoramic image | Mapping the seafloor, locating wrecks |\n\n### Key Applications\n- **Naval**: submarine detection, mine hunting, navigation.  \n- **Commercial**: fishing (to locate schools of fish), offshore oil & gas (pipeline inspection).  \n- **Scientific**: mapping ocean topography, studying marine life.  \n- **Recreational**: fishing, diving, underwater photography.\n\n### Why It Matters\n- Sound travels far better in water than light, making sonar the primary means of “seeing” underwater.  \n- It enables safe navigation, resource exploration, and national security operations.\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound waves instead of radio waves to “see” what lies beneath the surface.",

In other words, the interest “compounds” or “re‑invests” itself, so each period you earn interest on a larger amount.\n\n### How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example |\n|------|--------------|---------|\n| **1. Start with a principal** | The initial amount of money you invest or borrow. | $1,000 |\n| **2. Apply the interest rate** | The rate (e.g., 5 % per year). | 5 % of $1,000 = $50 |\n| **3. Add the interest to the principal** | The new balance becomes the base for the next period. | $1,000 + $50 = $1,050 |\n| **4. Repeat for each period** | Interest is calculated on the new balance. | Next year: 5 % of $1,050 = $52.50 |\n\n### Formula\n\nFor **annual compounding**:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = amount after \\(t\\) years  \n- \\(P\\) = principal (initial amount)  \n- \\(r\\) = annual interest rate (decimal)  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year  \n- \\(t\\) = number of years  \n\nIf interest compounds **continuously**:\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\n### Key points\n\n- **More frequent compounding** (e.g., monthly vs. yearly) yields a higher final amount.  \n- **Higher rates** and **longer time** both increase the effect of compounding.  \n- In loans, compound interest means you pay more over time; in savings, it means you earn more.\n\n### Quick example\n\nInvest $1,000 at 5 % per year, compounded annually for 3 years:\n\n\\[\nA = 1000 \\left(1 + 0.05\\right)^3 = 1000 \\times 1.157625 = \\$1,157.63\n\\]\n\nIf the same rate were compounded **monthly** (12 times a year):\n\n\\[\nA = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  \\approx \\$1,161.62\n\\]\n\nThe extra $3.99 comes from the interest being added more often.\n\n**In short:** Compound interest is the “interest on interest” that grows your money (or debt) faster than simple interest, which only applies to the original principal.",

      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why do we need hybridization?\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have different shapes and energies.  \n- In many molecules, the observed bond angles and shapes (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal‑planar, linear) cannot be explained by a single type of orbital.  \n- Hybridization provides a way to combine orbitals of the same atom into new orbitals that are **spatially equivalent** and match the observed geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The basic idea\n\n1. **Take the valence orbitals** of an atom (e.g., 1 s, 2 p).  \n2. **Mix** them mathematically to create new orbitals that are linear combinations of the originals.  \n3. **Use** these new orbitals to form σ‑bonds (and sometimes π‑bonds) with other atoms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common hybridization types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example molecule |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal‑planar (120°) | BF₃, ethylene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal‑bipyramidal (120°, 90°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n> **Note:** The “d” orbitals are used only when the central atom is in the third period or higher (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur).\n\n---\n\n## 4. How hybridization works (simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count its valence electrons.  \n2. **Determine the number of σ‑bonds** (and lone pairs) it forms.  \n3. **Assign hybrid orbitals**:  \n   - 1 σ‑bond → sp  \n   - 2 σ‑bonds → sp²  \n   - 3 σ‑bonds → sp³  \n   - 4 σ‑bonds → sp³d  \n   - 5 σ‑bonds → sp³d²  \n4. **Place lone pairs** in the remaining hybrid orbitals.  \n5. **Draw the geometry** using the hybrid orbitals as axes.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons → 4 σ‑bonds with H.  \n- Hybridization: **sp³** (1 s + 3 p).  \n- Geometry: tetrahedral, 109.5°.  \n- Each C–H bond is formed by overlap of a C sp³ orbital with an H 1s orbital.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Hybridization vs. Molecular Orbital Theory\n\n- **Hybridization** is a *localized* model (focuses on individual atoms).  \n- **Molecular orbital (MO) theory** treats electrons as delocalized over the whole molecule.  \n- For many simple molecules, both models give the same geometry predictions, but MO theory is more accurate for larger, conjugated systems.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick “cheat sheet”\n\n| Bonding situation | Hybridization | Bond angle | Typical shape |\n|-------------------|---------------|------------|---------------|\n| 2 bonds + 2 lone pairs | sp | 180° | Linear (e.g., BeCl₂) |\n| 3 bonds + 1 lone pair | sp² | 120° | Trigonal‑planar (e.g., BF₃) |\n| 4 bonds | sp³ | 109.5° | Tetrahedral (e.g., CH₄) |\n| 5 bonds | sp³d | 90°/120° | Trigonal‑bipyramidal (e.g., PCl₅) |\n| 6 bonds | sp³d² | 90° | Octahedral (e.g., SF₆) |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a useful conceptual tool that explains how atoms form bonds with specific geometries by mixing their atomic orbitals into new, equivalent orbitals. It’s especially handy for predicting shapes of molecules in organic chemistry and for understanding the bonding in many inorganic compounds.",

By modeling these speeds, geophysicists infer the temperature profile. |\n| **Heat flow measurements** | The heat flux from the mantle to the surface (~ 47 TW) constrains the core’s temperature gradient. |\n| **Laboratory experiments** | High‑pressure, high‑temperature experiments on iron alloys help calibrate the models. |\n| **Numerical simulations** | Computational models of Earth’s thermal evolution (including radioactive decay and core cooling) converge on ~ 5.5–6 k°C. |\n\n### Quick reference\n\n- **Inner core radius**: ~ 1 220 km (about 1/3 of Earth’s radius).  \n- **Estimated temperature**: 5 500 °C to 6 000 °C (10 000 °F to 11 000 °F).  \n- **Comparison**: That’s roughly the temperature of the surface of the Sun’s photosphere (~ 5 500 °C).  \n\nSo, the Earth’s center is as hot as the Sun’s outer layer, but it’s a solid iron core rather than a plasma.",

They do this by using the photovoltaic effect, where photons from the sun knock electrons loose from atoms in a semiconductor material, creating a flow of electric current.\n\n### How they work\n1. **Semiconductor material** – Most solar cells use silicon (single‑crystal or polycrystalline). The silicon is doped with impurities to create two layers:\n   * **n‑type** (extra electrons)\n   * **p‑type** (missing electrons, or “holes”)\n2. **p‑n junction** – When the two layers meet, an electric field forms at the junction, pushing electrons toward the n‑side and holes toward the p‑side.\n3. **Light absorption** – Sunlight hits the cell, photons excite electrons, creating electron‑hole pairs.\n4. **Current flow** – The internal electric field drives electrons out of the cell through an external circuit, producing usable DC power. The holes move in the opposite direction, completing the circuit inside the cell.\n\n### Key characteristics\n| Feature | Typical value |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Efficiency** | 15–22 % for commercial silicon panels (higher for specialized cells). |\n| **Voltage** | ~0.5–0.6 V per cell (a typical panel contains 60–72 cells in series). |\n| **Current** | Depends on light intensity; a 300‑W panel might produce ~5 A at full sun. |\n| **Lifetime** | 25–30 years with minimal degradation (~0.5 % per year). |\n\n### Types of solar cells\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Monocrystalline** | Made from a single crystal of silicon; highest efficiency, more expensive. |\n| **Polycrystalline** | Made from multiple silicon crystals; slightly lower efficiency, cheaper. |\n| **Thin‑film** | Uses layers of semiconductor materials (CdTe, CIGS, amorphous silicon) on flexible substrates; lower cost, lower efficiency. |\n| **Perovskite** | Emerging technology with rapidly improving efficiencies; still in development. |\n\n### Applications\n* **Residential and commercial rooftop panels** – Provide electricity for homes and businesses.  \n* **Utility‑scale solar farms** – Large arrays that feed power into the grid.  \n* **Portable devices** – Solar chargers, solar-powered calculators, etc.  \n* **Spacecraft** – Solar panels power satellites and space probes.  \n\n### Why they matter\nSolar cells are a key component of renewable energy, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, lowering greenhouse‑gas emissions, and providing a clean, inexhaustible power source.",

Their electrical conductivity can be precisely controlled by adding impurities (doping) or by changing temperature, light, or electric fields. This tunability makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n### Key characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Band gap** | A small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can jump across this gap with a modest amount of energy. |\n| **Doping** | Introducing small amounts of other elements (e.g., phosphorus or boron in silicon) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or “holes” (p‑type), enabling control of charge carriers. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common are crystalline silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), but many others exist (GaAs, SiC, InP, etc.). |\n\n### Why they matter\n\n1. **Transistors** – The fundamental building block of all digital electronics. A single transistor can act as a switch or amplifier.  \n2. **Integrated circuits (ICs)** – Millions of transistors packed onto a single chip (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, memory).  \n3. **Photovoltaics** – Solar cells use semiconductor junctions to convert light into electricity.  \n4. **Sensors & LEDs** – Semiconductors produce light (LEDs) or detect light, heat, pressure, etc.  \n5. **Communication** – RF and optical communication devices rely on semiconductor diodes and lasers.\n\n### Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | CMOS logic, memory, solar cells | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | High‑speed transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | RF, microwave, laser diodes | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 3.26 |\n| **Indium Phosphide (InP)** | Optoelectronics, high‑speed lasers | 1.35 |\n\n### How a semiconductor works (simplified)\n\n1. **p‑n junction** – Two regions (p‑type and n‑type) are joined.  \n2. **Depletion zone** – Electrons from the n‑side recombine with holes from the p‑side, creating a region with no free charge carriers.  \n3. **Biasing** – Applying a voltage across the junction controls the flow of carriers:  \n   * **Forward bias** (p‑side positive) allows current to flow.  \n   * **Reverse bias** (p‑side negative) blocks current, except for a tiny leakage current.  \n\nThis behavior underpins diodes, transistors (BJT, MOSFET), and many other devices.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Semiconductors are engineered materials whose conductivity can be finely tuned, enabling the creation of virtually all modern electronic devices—from microprocessors to solar panels.",

      "question": "What is natural gas composed of ?",
      "system_answer": "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is mainly hydrocarbons, but the exact mix varies with the field and the depth of the deposit.  The typical composition (by volume) is:\n\n| Component | Typical range | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; the “fuel” that gives natural gas its energy content. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | A heavier hydrocarbon that can be separated for use as a feedstock for plastics. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Often recovered as a by‑product; used for heating and as a vehicle fuel. |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Includes both normal and iso‑butane; used in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and as a gasoline additive. |\n| **Other heavier hydrocarbons** (pentanes, hexanes, etc.) | < 1 % | Usually present in trace amounts. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; can reduce the heating value if present in high amounts. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; removed in many processing plants to improve energy content. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.1 % (often < 0.01 %) | Toxic and corrosive; must be removed before distribution. |\n| **Water vapor (H₂O)** | < 0.5 % | Condensed out during processing. |\n| **Trace gases** (e.g., helium, neon, argon, methane‑derived gases) | < 0.1 % | Usually negligible for energy calculations. |\n\n### Why the composition matters\n\n- **Energy content**: Methane has the highest heating value per unit volume; heavier hydrocarbons add more energy but also require separation.\n- **Processing**: Nitrogen, CO₂, H₂S, and water must be removed to meet pipeline specifications and to avoid corrosion or toxicity.\n- **Market value**: Ethane, propane, and butanes are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks or as fuels in their own right.\n\nIn short, natural gas is a mixture dominated by methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons, nitrogen, CO₂, and trace impurities that are managed during processing before the gas reaches homes, industry, or power plants.",
