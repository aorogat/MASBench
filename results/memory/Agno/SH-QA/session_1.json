      "question": "What is the Norman architecture idiom?",
      "system_answer": "**Norman architecture**—often called the *Norman idiom*—is the Romanesque style that flourished in England, Normandy, and parts of the British Isles after the Norman Conquest (1066 – 12th century).  It is distinguished by a set of architectural “words” and “phrases” that give it a recognizable, almost “dialectical” character:\n\n| Feature | What it looks like | Why it matters |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Massive stone walls** | Thick, heavy masonry that gives a fortress‑like feel | Communicates power and permanence |\n| **Round (semi‑circular) arches** | Used in doorways, windows, arcades, and barrel vaults | A hallmark of Romanesque design, but the Norman version is often more robust |\n| **Large towers and turrets** | Often square or round, sometimes with crenellations | Adds verticality and a defensive look |\n| **Heavy, simple ornamentation** | Sculpted capitals, chevron (zig‑zag) patterns, and blind arcades | Less elaborate than later Gothic, but still visually striking |\n| **Use of stone vaulting** | Barrel and groin vaults in nave and transept | Provides structural stability and a dramatic interior |\n| **Large, simple windows** | Small, narrow openings with minimal tracery | Keeps walls thick and secure |\n| **Symmetrical plans** | Often cruciform or rectangular with a clear axis | Reflects the Norman preference for order and control |\n\n### Typical examples\n\n- **Durham Cathedral** (England) – a textbook Norman cathedral with a massive nave, round arches, and a prominent west tower.\n- **Tower of London** (England) – a Norman fortress with thick walls, round arches, and a massive keep.\n- **St. Sébastien‑de‑Bergues** (Normandy, France) – a Norman church with a simple, robust design.\n- **Salisbury Cathedral** (England) – while later Gothic, its early Norman nave and transepts still show the idiom.\n\n### Why it’s called an “idiom”\n\nIn architecture, an *idiom* refers to a set of recurring design elements that together create a distinct style. The Norman idiom is a “language” of stone, arch, and mass that was used to express Norman authority and to adapt Romanesque forms to the English climate and building traditions.\n\nSo, the Norman architecture idiom is the recognizable vocabulary of thick stone walls, round arches, and robust towers that defined Norman building projects in the 11th–12th centuries.",
