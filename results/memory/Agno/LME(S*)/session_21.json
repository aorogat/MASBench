      "system_answer": "Sure! For most people, a safe and effective dilution for topical use is **about 5 % tea‑tree oil**. That translates to:\n\n- **1 drop of tea‑tree oil per 1 tablespoon (≈15 mL) of carrier oil**  \n  → roughly a **1:10** ratio (1 part essential oil to 10 parts carrier).\n\nIf you have very sensitive skin or are using it on a larger area, you can go even gentler:\n\n- **1 drop of tea‑tree oil per 2 tablespoons (≈30 mL) of carrier oil**  \n  → about a **1:20** ratio (1 part essential oil to 20 parts carrier).\n\n**Quick reference**\n\n| Sensitivity | Dilution ratio | Approx % concentration |\n|-------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Normal skin | 1 drop / 1 Tbsp | ~5 % |\n| Sensitive skin | 1 drop / 2 Tbsp | ~2.5 % |\n\n**How to mix**\n\n1. Choose a neutral carrier oil (e.g., jojoba, sweet almond, or fractionated coconut).  \n2. Add the carrier oil to a small bottle or container.  \n3. Add the appropriate number of tea‑tree drops.  \n4. Shake well to blend.\n\n**Tip:** Always do a patch test first—apply a small amount to a discreet area (inner forearm, behind the ear) and wait 24 hours to ensure no irritation. If you’re using it for a specific condition (acne, fungal infections, etc.), you might want to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.",
