      "system_answer": "Here are some practical, quick‑win tips that usually help most smartphones (iOS or Android) get a bit more juice out of each charge:\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How to Do It |\n|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Lower screen brightness** | The display is the biggest power hog. | Go to Settings → Display → Brightness and set it to 30‑50 % (or enable Auto‑Brightness). |\n| **Use Dark Mode** | OLED/AMOLED screens use less power on dark pixels. | Settings → Display → Dark Mode (or enable “Night Shift” on iOS). |\n| **Turn off unused radios** | Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and mobile data drain battery even when not in use. | Settings → Connections → toggle Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Mobile Data off when not needed. |\n| **Enable Battery Saver / Power Saving Mode** | The OS throttles background activity and reduces performance to save power. | Settings → Battery → Battery Saver (Android) or Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode (iOS). |\n| **Close background apps** | Some apps keep running in the background and consume CPU cycles. | Swipe up (iOS) or long‑press the home button (Android) and swipe apps away. |\n| **Check battery‑heavy apps** | Identify which apps are draining the battery. | Settings → Battery → Battery Usage (Android) or Settings → Battery → Battery Usage (iOS). |\n| **Disable notifications for non‑essential apps** | Each notification wakes the screen and uses CPU. | Settings → Notifications → turn off for apps that aren’t urgent. |\n| **Turn off vibration** | Vibration motors consume power. | Settings → Sound & Vibration → disable “Vibrate on ring” and “Vibrate on keypress.” |\n| **Use Wi‑Fi instead of mobile data** | Wi‑Fi is usually more power‑efficient than cellular. | Connect to a known Wi‑Fi network whenever possible. |\n| **Keep the phone cool** | Heat accelerates battery degradation and reduces efficiency. | Avoid leaving the phone in direct sunlight or in a hot car. |\n| **Update the OS and apps** | Updates often include battery‑optimization fixes. | Settings → System → Software Update (Android) or Settings → General → Software Update (iOS). |\n| **Calibrate the battery (if old)** | Helps the phone report battery level more accurately. | Fully discharge to 0 %, then charge to 100 % without interruption. |\n| **Replace the battery if it’s old** | Lithium‑ion batteries lose capacity over ~300‑500 charge cycles. | If you’re seeing a rapid drop in battery life and the phone is >2 years old, consider a replacement (Apple‑certified or OEM). |\n| **Use a power‑efficient charger** | Fast chargers can heat the battery; a standard charger is often gentler. | Use the charger that came with the phone or a reputable brand. |\n\n### Quick Checklist for Tonight\n\n1. **Turn on Battery Saver** – you’re already at 23:36, so you’ll get a few extra hours.  \n2. **Lower brightness to 40 %** – you’ll still see everything, but the screen will use less power.  \n3. **Close all background apps** – especially social media or streaming apps.  \n4. **Disable Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth** if you’re not using them.  \n5. **Check battery usage** – if a single app is using >30 % of the battery, consider uninstalling or limiting its use.\n\nIf you try these and still notice a dramatic drop in battery life, it might be time to look at the battery health stats in Settings or bring the phone in for a battery replacement. Good luck!",
