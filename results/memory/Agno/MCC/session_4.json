      "question": "fight me in street fighter",
      "system_answer": "I’m not able to jump into a game and play a match, but I can definitely help you get ready for a Street Fighter showdown! Here are a few quick tips:\n\n| Tip | What it means | Why it helps |\n|-----|----------------|--------------|\n| **Choose a character you like** | Pick a fighter whose moveset feels natural to you (e.g., Ryu for balanced, Chun‑Li for speed, or a more niche character like Zangief if you enjoy grappling). | Comfort with a character’s feel makes it easier to react in fast‑paced matches. |\n| **Learn the basics** | Master the 4‑button layout (light, medium, heavy, special) and the command inputs for your character’s key moves. | Knowing the core moves lets you build combos and defend effectively. |\n| **Practice combos** | Start with simple combos (e.g., light → medium → heavy) and then add special moves. | Combos are the primary source of damage; the more you know, the more you can punish opponents. |\n| **Use the practice mode** | Play against the AI, set up specific scenarios, and test your combos. | It lets you refine timing and learn how to react to different opponent behaviors. |\n| **Watch replays** | Record your matches or watch top players’ streams. | Seeing mistakes and good plays helps you spot patterns and improve strategy. |\n| **Mind the spacing** | Keep a safe distance when you’re unsure of your opponent’s range. | Good spacing reduces the chance of getting hit by a surprise special or combo. |\n| **Keep your cool** | Stay calm, even if you’re losing. | A clear head lets you spot openings and avoid making the same mistakes. |\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into a specific character or a particular matchup, just let me know! I can give you more detailed move lists, combo chains, or strategy guides. Good luck on the battlefield!",

      "system_answer": "**How to Shut Off the Kitchen Light – Quick Guide**\n\n| Method | What to Do | Tips & Safety Notes |\n|--------|------------|---------------------|\n| **Wall Switch** | 1. Locate the switch on the wall near the kitchen entrance or along the kitchen wall.<br>2. Flip the switch down (or to the “off” position). | • If the switch is a toggle, simply push it down.<br>• If it’s a rocker, press the lower half.<br>• If you can’t find a switch, look for a pull‑chain on the fixture itself. |\n| **Pull‑Chain Fixture** | 1. Grab the chain hanging from the light fixture.<br>2. Pull firmly until you feel resistance or hear a click. | • Pulling too hard can damage the chain or fixture.<br>• Some fixtures have a “soft‑off” mode that dims before fully shutting off. |\n| **Smart Light Switch / Hub** | 1. Open the corresponding app (e.g., Philips Hue, LIFX, SmartThings).<br>2. Select the kitchen light and tap “Off.” | • Ensure the light is connected to the hub and powered on.<br>• If you’re using voice control, say “Hey [Assistant], turn off the kitchen light.” |\n| **Smart Bulb (no switch)** | 1. Use the bulb’s companion app or voice command to turn it off.<br>2. If you’re in the kitchen, you can also use a physical dimmer or a smart plug that controls the bulb. | • Some bulbs support “scene” presets; choose “Off” or “Dim 0%.” |\n| **Ceiling Fan Light** | 1. If the fan has a separate light switch, turn that off first.<br>2. If the fan’s light is integrated, use the fan’s control panel or remote. | • Turning off the fan first can reduce power draw and prolong bulb life. |\n| **Emergency Shut‑Off** | 1. If you’re dealing with a power surge or electrical fault, locate the main breaker panel.<br>2. Flip the breaker for the kitchen circuit to “Off.” | • Only do this if you’re trained or comfortable with electrical work.<br>• After resetting, check for any signs of damage or malfunction. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- **Find the switch**: Wall, pull‑chain, or smart control.\n- **Confirm the light is off**: Look for a dimming or no glow.\n- **Check for smart devices**: App or voice command if you have a smart setup.\n- **Safety first**: If you suspect an electrical issue, consider turning off the circuit breaker.\n\n---\n\n#### Common Troubleshooting\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| Light stays on after flipping the switch | Switch is faulty or miswired | Replace the switch or call an electrician |\n| Light flickers or dims | Loose bulb or dimmer incompatibility | Tighten bulb, replace dimmer, or use a compatible bulb |\n| Smart light doesn’t respond | Wi‑Fi outage or app error | Reboot router, check app, reset bulb |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Most kitchen lights are controlled by a simple wall switch. If you have a smart system, use the app or voice command. If you’re unsure, look for a pull‑chain or consult the fixture’s manual. If you suspect an electrical problem, turn off the circuit breaker and call a professional.",

      "system_answer": "**How to Call a Yellow Cab (in the U.S.)**\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why It Works |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 1. **Know the local dispatch number** | In most major U.S. cities, yellow cabs are operated by a single dispatch center. For example: <br>• **New York City** – 212‑NEW‑YORK (212‑639‑9675) or 311 for non‑emergency requests. <br>• **Chicago** – 312‑NEW‑CHIC (312‑639‑9675). <br>• **Los Angeles** – 323‑NEW‑LA (323‑639‑9675). | The dispatch center coordinates all yellow‑cab pickups, ensuring you get a licensed vehicle. |\n| 2. **Use a ride‑hailing app** | Apps like **Uber**, **Lyft**, or **Curb** let you request a “yellow cab” or “licensed taxi” specifically. Search for “taxi” or “yellow cab” in the app’s vehicle type filter. | Many yellow‑cab companies partner with these apps, so you can get a guaranteed licensed ride without calling a phone number. |\n| 3. **Hail on the street** | In cities with a high density of yellow cabs (NYC, Chicago, etc.), simply wave a yellow cab at a curb or designated taxi stand. | Yellow cabs are required to accept any passenger who hails them, provided the fare is within the city’s regulated range. |\n| 4. **Call 911 for emergencies** | If you’re in immediate danger or need urgent medical help, dial **911**. The dispatcher can arrange a taxi if needed. | 911 is the emergency line; dispatchers can coordinate a taxi for you if it’s safe to do so. |\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n- **Have your pickup location ready** – the dispatcher will need the exact address or landmark.  \n- **Know the fare structure** – most cities publish a fare chart online; this helps you estimate cost and avoid surprises.  \n- **Keep a backup plan** – if the dispatch line is busy, try the app or hail a cab on the street.  \n- **Safety first** – verify the taxi’s license plate (NYC: “NYC” followed by a 5‑digit number) and driver ID before getting in.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- **Phone**: Call the city’s taxi dispatch number.  \n- **App**: Use Uber/Lyft/Curb and select “taxi” or “yellow cab.”  \n- **Street**: Hail a cab directly if you’re in a city with a high yellow‑cab presence.  \n\nThat’s all you need to get a yellow cab on the road!",

      "question": "can i mine for gold on any public land",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nNo – you can’t just start mining for gold on any public land.  Public lands are managed by federal, state, and local agencies, and each has its own rules, permits, and restrictions.  Mining is allowed only under specific conditions and usually requires a permit, claim, or lease, plus compliance with environmental and safety regulations.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Who manages the land?\n\n| Land type | Managing agency | Typical rules for mining |\n|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| **Federal lands** (e.g., Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), National Forests, National Parks) | BLM, USFS, National Park Service | Mining is allowed only with a **mining claim** or **lease**.  You must file a claim (for placer or lode mining) or obtain a lease (for surface or underground mining).  Environmental reviews (NEPA) and reclamation plans are required. |\n| **State lands** | State land‑management agencies | Rules vary by state.  Some states allow “small‑scale” or “hand‑panning” placer mining with a simple permit; others require formal claims or leases. |\n| **Local/municipal lands** | County or city governments | Often have ordinances that prohibit or heavily regulate mining.  Some may allow hobby mining with a permit. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What you need to do\n\n1. **Identify the land**  \n   * Use the BLM’s “Mineral Management” map or the USFS “Land Use” portal to see if the area is open for mining.  \n   * Check state mining offices for local rules.\n\n2. **Determine the type of mining**  \n   * **Placer mining** (panning, sluicing, dredging) – usually the easiest to get a permit for.  \n   * **Lode mining** (underground or surface) – requires a formal claim and more extensive permitting.\n\n3. **File a mining claim (if applicable)**  \n   * **BLM**: File a “Mining Claim” online or in person.  You must pay a filing fee, publish a notice in a local newspaper, and record the claim.  \n   * **USFS**: Similar process, but often requires a “Mining Lease” and a reclamation plan.\n\n4. **Obtain a permit**  \n   * **Surface Mining**: Requires a Surface Mining Permit (SMP) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) for certain minerals.  \n   * **Environmental Review**: NEPA or state environmental assessments may be required.  \n   * **Reclamation Plan**: You must agree to restore the land after mining.\n\n5. **Follow ongoing regulations**  \n   * **Water rights**: You may need a water license if you’ll use water.  \n   * **Wildlife and habitat**: Avoid protected species and habitats.  \n   * **Safety**: Follow OSHA or state safety regulations for mining operations.\n\n---\n\n## 3",
