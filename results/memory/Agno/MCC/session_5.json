      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the heart‑rate range you aim to stay within while exercising so that you get the desired training effect (e.g., improving cardiovascular fitness, burning fat, or training for endurance) without over‑exerting yourself.\n\n---\n\n### 1. How it’s calculated\n\n| Step | What you do | Typical formula |\n|------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **1. Estimate your maximum heart rate (MHR)** | Subtract your age from 220 (a rough rule of thumb). | **MHR ≈ 220 – age** |\n| **2. Pick a training intensity** | Expressed as a percentage of MHR. Common zones: <br>• **Light**: 50–60 % <br>• **Moderate**: 60–70 % <br>• **Hard**: 70–85 % <br>• **Maximum**: 85–95 % | **Target HR = MHR × %** |\n| **3. Determine the target range** | Multiply MHR by the lower and upper percentages. | **Target HR range = (MHR × lower %) – (MHR × upper %)** |\n\n**Example** – 35‑year‑old runner  \n- MHR ≈ 220 – 35 = 185 bpm  \n- Moderate zone (60–70 %): 185 × 0.60 = 111 bpm to 185 × 0.70 = 130 bpm  \n- So the target heart‑rate range is **111–130 beats per minute**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why it matters\n\n| Goal | Target zone | What you’ll feel |\n|------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Cardiovascular fitness** | 70–85 % MHR | “Hard” effort, can talk in short sentences |\n| **Fat burning** | 50–70 % MHR | “Moderate” effort, can hold a conversation |\n| **Endurance training** | 60–75 % MHR | Sustained effort, steady breathing |\n| **Recovery / warm‑up** | 50–60 % MHR | Light effort, easy breathing |\n\nStaying in the right zone helps you:\n\n* **Maximize training benefits** (e.g., improve VO₂ max, increase aerobic capacity).  \n* **Avoid overtraining** (excessive heart rate can lead to fatigue or injury).  \n* **Track progress** (your target zone may shift as fitness improves).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Alternative method – Heart‑Rate Reserve (HRR)\n\nThe HRR method uses your resting heart rate (RHR) to give a more individualized target:\n\n1. **HRR = MHR – RHR**  \n2. **Target HR = RHR + (HRR × %)**\n\nThis accounts for differences in resting heart rate and can be more accurate for people with very high or very low RHR.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical tips\n\n| Tip | Why it helps |\n|-----|--------------|\n| **Use a reliable heart‑rate monitor** (wrist‑based or chest strap). | Accurate readings keep you in the right zone. |\n| **Check your RHR** once a week. | Helps adjust HRR calculations. |\n| **Warm‑up and cool‑down** in the lower zone. | Prevents sudden spikes and aids recovery. |\n| **Listen to your body**. | If you feel dizzy, short‑of‑breath, or chest discomfort, lower the intensity. |\n| **Consult a professional** if you have heart conditions or are new to exercise. | Safety first. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick reference table\n\n| Age | MHR (220‑age) | 60 % MHR | 70 % MHR | 80 % MHR |\n|-----|---------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 20 | 200 | 120 | 140 | 160 |\n| 30 | 190 | 114 | 133 | 152 |\n| 40 | 180 | 108 | 126 | 144 |\n| 50 | 170 | 102 | 119 | 136 |\n| 60 | 160 | 96 | 112 | 128 |\n\n*(Numbers are rounded to the nearest whole beat.)*\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nTarget heart rate is the heart‑rate range you aim for during exercise, calculated as a percentage of your maximum (or heart‑rate reserve). It’s a practical tool to ensure you’re training at the right intensity for your goals while staying safe.",

      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—molecules that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.  The vast majority of enzymes are proteins, but a small number of functional RNA molecules (ribozymes) also exhibit catalytic activity.\n\n---\n\n### Core Characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Catalytic role** | Lower the activation energy of a reaction, increasing the rate. |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one or a few chemically similar substrates (the “substrate” binds to the enzyme’s *active site*). |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by allosteric effectors, covalent modifications, pH, temperature, and inhibitors/activators. |\n| **Not consumed** | The enzyme remains unchanged after the reaction and can catalyze many cycles. |\n| **Structure‑function relationship** | The three‑dimensional shape of the enzyme (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary structures) determines its active‑site geometry and catalytic mechanism. |\n\n---\n\n### Classification\n\n1. **By Reaction Type (EC Numbers)** – The Enzyme Commission (EC) system assigns a four‑part number (e.g., EC 3.2.1.1 for α‑amylase).  \n   * **EC 1** – Oxidoreductases  \n   * **EC 2** – Transferases  \n   * **EC 3** – Hydrolases  \n   * **EC 4** – Lyases  \n   * **EC 5** – Isomerases  \n   * **EC 6** – Ligases  \n   * **EC 7** – Translocases  \n\n2. **By Structural Family** – e.g., α/β‑hydrolase fold, TIM‑barrel, Rossmann fold.  \n\n3. **By Biological Role** – Metabolic enzymes (glycolysis, TCA cycle), regulatory enzymes (kinases, phosphatases), structural enzymes (collagenase), etc.\n\n---\n\n### Mechanistic Themes\n\n| Mechanism | Example |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Acid–base catalysis** | Serine proteases (trypsin) use a catalytic triad (Ser, His, Asp). |\n| **Covalent catalysis** | Acetylcholinesterase forms a transient covalent intermediate with acetylcholine. |\n| **Metal‑ion catalysis** | Zinc‑dependent alcohol dehydrogenase uses Zn²⁺ to stabilize the alkoxide. |\n| **Proximity/Orientation** | DNA polymerase aligns nucleotides for phosphodiester bond formation. |\n| **Substrate channeling** | Multi‑enzyme complexes (e.g., fatty‑acid synthase) pass intermediates directly between active sites. |\n\n---\n\n### Key Examples\n\n| Enzyme | Function | Organism |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| **Amylase** | Hydrolyzes starch → maltose | Saliva, pancreas |\n| **DNA polymerase** | Synthesizes DNA strands | All cells |\n| **Cytochrome P450** | Oxidative metabolism of drugs | Liver |\n| **Lactase** | Hydrolyzes lactose → glucose + galactose | Mammals |\n| **Ribonuclease H** | Degrades RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids | Retroviruses, host cells |\n| **Ribozymes** (e.g., hammerhead ribozyme) | Catalyze self‑cleavage | Viral genomes |\n\n---\n\n### Biological Significance\n\n* **Metabolism** – Enzymes drive anabolic and catabolic pathways, enabling energy extraction and biosynthesis.  \n* **Signal Transduction** – Kinases, phosphatases, and proteases modulate signaling cascades.  \n* **Gene Expression** – RNA polymerases, ribosomes, and splicing enzymes orchestrate transcription and translation.  \n* **Defense** – Antimicrobial peptides, proteases, and oxidases protect against pathogens.  \n\n---\n\n### Clinical and Industrial Relevance\n\n| Area | Enzyme‑related application |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Medicine** | Enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ACE inhibitors, protease inhibitors for HIV) treat hypertension, viral infections, and cancers. |\n| **Diagnostics** | Enzymatic assays (e.g., glucose oxidase for blood glucose meters). |\n| **Biotechnology",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun itself isn’t actually “yellow” – it emits a broad spectrum of light that is essentially white.  The reason we usually see it as yellow (or sometimes orange or red) is a combination of the Sun’s temperature and the way Earth’s atmosphere scatters light.\n\n1. **Solar spectrum**  \n   - The Sun’s surface temperature is about 5,800 K.  \n   - A black‑body at that temperature emits most strongly in the visible range, with a peak around 500 nm (green‑yellow).  \n   - When you add the full spectrum together, the Sun’s intrinsic color is white or very pale yellowish‑white.\n\n2. **Atmospheric scattering (Rayleigh scattering)**  \n   - Short‑wavelength blue light is scattered much more strongly by air molecules than longer wavelengths.  \n   - When the Sun is high in the sky, the line of sight passes through less atmosphere, so the blue component is less scattered out of the beam, and the Sun looks whiter or slightly yellowish.  \n   - Near sunrise or sunset, the light travels through a much thicker layer of air, scattering away most of the blue and green light, leaving the longer‑wavelength reds and oranges to dominate.\n\n3. **Human perception**  \n   - Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light, so a white light that has a slight excess of those wavelengths often appears yellowish to us.\n\nSo, the Sun is intrinsically white, but the scattering of blue light by Earth’s atmosphere makes it appear yellow (or orange/red at low angles).",

It is caused by the foot‑and‑mouth disease virus (FMDV), a member of the *Picornaviridae* family.  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Virus** | FMDV is an RNA virus with seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed or water, aerosol spread over short distances, and fomites (vehicles, clothing, equipment). |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 40 °C) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) in the mouth, on the tongue, and around the lips <br>• Vesicles on the feet, especially the interdigital spaces, leading to lameness <br>• Drooling, difficulty eating, and weight loss <br>• In severe cases, secondary bacterial infections can cause death. |\n| **Incubation period** | 2–14 days, typically 4–7 days. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from decreased productivity (milk, meat, wool), trade restrictions, culling of infected and exposed animals, and costs of vaccination and biosecurity. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Vaccination (in many countries, a routine or emergency vaccination program). <br>• Strict movement controls and quarantine of affected herds. <br>• Biosecurity measures: disinfection, controlled access, and removal of contaminated materials. <br>• Surveillance and rapid reporting to authorities. |\n| **Global status** | FMD is endemic in many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is a notifiable disease under the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). |\n\n**Key take‑away:** Foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral disease that causes painful blisters in the mouth and on the feet of cloven‑hoofed animals, leading to significant animal welfare concerns and major economic losses for livestock producers worldwide.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (acronym for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and characterize objects or features in a medium—most commonly water. By emitting acoustic pulses and listening for echoes, sonar systems can determine distance, speed, direction, and sometimes the shape or composition of submerged targets.\n\n---\n\n### How Sonar Works\n\n| Step | What Happens | Key Concepts |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Transmission** | A transducer (speaker‑like device) emits a short burst of sound (the *ping*). | Frequency (kHz–MHz), pulse length, beam pattern. |\n| **Propagation** | The sound travels through the medium (water, ice, etc.). | Speed of sound (~1,500 m/s in seawater, varies with temperature, salinity, depth). |\n| **Reflection/Scattering** | The wave encounters an object or boundary and is reflected back. | Reflection coefficient depends on material contrast. |\n| **Reception** | A receiver (often the same transducer) picks up the echo. | Time‑of‑flight, amplitude, frequency shift. |\n| **Processing** | The system calculates distance, speed, and other attributes. | Distance = (speed × time)/2; Doppler shift → velocity. |\n\n---\n\n### Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | Description | Typical Uses |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Navigation, depth sounding, fish‑finding, submarine detection. |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., engines, propellers). | Anti‑submarine warfare, marine biology studies. |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Uses high‑frequency sound to create detailed images of objects or seabed. | Underwater archaeology, pipeline inspection. |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to map the seafloor. | Mine detection, seabed mapping. |\n| **Multibeam Sonar** | Emits multiple beams to produce a 3‑D map of the seafloor. | Bathymetric surveys, navigation charts. |\n\n---\n\n### Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | What It Tells You | Typical Range |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Frequency** | Determines resolution vs. penetration. | 10 kHz–200 kHz for navigation; >200 kHz for imaging. |\n| **Beamwidth** | Angular spread of the transmitted sound. | Narrow beams (~1–5°) for high‑resolution imaging; wide beams for broad coverage. |\n| **Pulse Length** | Duration of the emitted sound. | Short pulses (~1 ms) for high resolution; longer pulses for deeper penetration. |\n| **Signal‑to‑Noise Ratio (SNR)** | Quality of the echo relative to background noise. | Higher SNR → clearer detection. |\n\n---\n\n### Common Applications\n\n| Field | Example |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Naval & Military** | Submarine detection, mine countermeasures, underwater surveillance. |\n| **Commercial Shipping** | Collision avoidance, navigation in shallow waters. |\n| **Fishing Industry** | Fish‑finding, depth measurement. |\n| **Marine Science** | Bathymetry, habitat mapping, acoustic telemetry. |\n| **Engineering & Construction** | Pipeline inspection, offshore platform monitoring. |\n| **Archaeology** | Underwater site discovery and mapping. |\n\n---\n\n### Fun Fact\n\n- The **speed of sound in seawater** is roughly 1,500 m/s, but it increases with temperature, salinity, and pressure. This variability is a key factor in precise sonar calculations.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** Sonar is an acoustic “radar” that sends out sound pulses, listens for echoes, and uses the returned signals to determine where objects are, how fast they’re moving, and sometimes what they’re made of—all by exploiting the physics of sound propagation in water.",

These also form long chains but are designed to be more biodegradable or compostable.  \n\n- **Additives** (plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, fillers) are mixed in to tailor flexibility, color, flame resistance, and other characteristics.  \n\nSo, at its core, plastic is a polymer—an organized, repeating chain of atoms—created from either fossil‑fuel‑derived monomers or renewable feedstocks, with additives to give it the desired performance.",

It is essentially a wound that has not healed properly and often exposes deeper layers of tissue. Ulcers can develop in many parts of the body, but the most common types are:\n\n| Type | Typical location | Common causes | Key symptoms |\n|------|------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic (gastric/duodenal) ulcer** | Stomach or upper small intestine | Helicobacter pylori infection, NSAID use, stress, smoking | Burning epigastric pain, nausea, bloating, sometimes vomiting blood |\n| **Pressure (decubitus) ulcer** | Skin over bony prominences (e.g., heels, sacrum) | Prolonged pressure, immobility, moisture, poor nutrition | Redness that becomes a sore, possible drainage, pain |\n| **Canker (aphthous) ulcer** | Oral mucosa | Immune dysregulation, stress, certain foods, vitamin deficiencies | Painful, shallow ulcer, often heals in 1–2 weeks |\n| **Venous stasis ulcer** | Lower leg, especially medial malleolus | Chronic venous insufficiency | Red, irregular ulcer with a raised border, often with edema |\n| **Diabetic foot ulcer** | Foot, especially plantar surface | Peripheral neuropathy, poor circulation, foot deformities | Often painless, may have drainage, risk of infection |\n\n### How an ulcer forms\n1. **Damage to the protective barrier** – The skin or mucous membrane is compromised by mechanical pressure, chemical irritation, infection, or reduced blood flow.\n2. **Inflammatory response** – The body’s immune system reacts, releasing enzymes and inflammatory mediators that can further degrade tissue.\n3. **Impaired healing** – Factors such as poor nutrition, diabetes, smoking, or medications (e.g., NSAIDs) can slow the repair process, allowing the ulcer to persist or worsen.\n\n### Common symptoms\n- Pain or discomfort at the ulcer site (often worse at night or after eating for peptic ulcers)\n- Redness, swelling, or warmth around the area\n- Drainage of fluid or pus\n- In severe cases, bleeding or foul odor\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Physical exam** – Inspection of the ulcer’s size, depth, and surrounding tissue.\n- **Imaging** – X‑ray, ultrasound, or CT for deeper or internal ulcers.\n- **Endoscopy** – For peptic ulcers, to visualize the stomach lining and obtain biopsies.\n- **Laboratory tests** – Blood tests for infection markers, anemia, or underlying conditions.\n\n### Treatment\n- **Address underlying cause** – Stop NSAIDs, treat H. pylori with antibiotics, improve blood flow, or relieve pressure.\n- **Medications** – Proton pump inhibitors or H₂ blockers for acid‑related ulcers; topical antibiotics or antiseptics for skin ulcers.\n- **Wound care** – Regular cleaning, appropriate dressings, and sometimes debridement (removal of dead tissue).\n- **Lifestyle changes** – Smoking cessation, balanced diet, weight management, and adequate hydration.\n- **Surgery** – Rarely needed, but may be required for severe or refractory ulcers.\n\n### Prevention\n- **For peptic ulcers** – Avoid unnecessary NSAID use, manage stress, and treat H. pylori promptly.\n- **For pressure ulcers** – Regular repositioning, use of pressure‑relieving mattresses, keeping skin dry and clean, and ensuring good nutrition.\n- **For diabetic ulcers** – Tight blood‑glucose control, proper foot care, and early treatment of any foot injuries.\n\nIn short, an ulcer is a persistent sore that results from a combination of tissue damage, inflammation, and impaired healing.

In other words, the interest “compounds” or grows on top of itself over time.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Principal (P)** – the initial amount of money deposited or invested.  \n2. **Rate (r)** – the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).  \n3. **Time (t)** – the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.  \n4. **Compounding frequency (n)** – how many times per year the interest is added to the principal (e.g., annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily).\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- **A** = the amount of money accumulated after t years, including interest.  \n- **P** = principal amount.  \n- **r** = annual interest rate (decimal).  \n- **n** = number of compounding periods per year.  \n- **t** = number of years.\n\nThe **interest earned** is \\(A - P\\).\n\n### Example\nSuppose you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded quarterly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = \\$1,000\\)  \n- \\(r = 0.05\\)  \n- \\(n = 4\\) (quarterly)  \n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 3}\n  = 1000 \\left(1 + 0.0125\\right)^{12}\n  = 1000 \\times (1.0125)^{12}\n  \\approx 1000 \\times 1.1616\n  \\approx \\$1,161.60\n\\]\n\nSo, after 3 years, you would have about **$1,161.60**, meaning you earned **$161.60** in compound interest.\n\n### Key Points\n- **Compounding frequency matters**: The more often interest is compounded, the more you earn (or owe).  \n- **Time amplifies the effect**: Even a modest rate can grow significantly over many years.  \n- **Compound interest is the “magic” behind many savings accounts, retirement plans, and investment growth**.\n\nFeel free to ask if you'd like to see how different compounding frequencies or rates affect the outcome!",

      "system_answer": "**Solar cells** (also called photovoltaic cells) are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity through the **photovoltaic effect**.  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Basic principle** | When photons from sunlight hit a semiconductor (usually silicon), they excite electrons, creating electron‑hole pairs. An internal electric field (created by a p‑n junction) separates these charges, producing a voltage and a current. |\n| **Common materials** | • Monocrystalline silicon (high purity, high efficiency) <br>• Polycrystalline silicon (lower cost, slightly lower efficiency) <br>• Thin‑film materials (amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIGS, perovskites) |\n| **Structure** | • Two layers of semiconductor with opposite doping (p‑type and n‑type) form a p‑n junction. <br>• Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer allows light in while collecting charge. <br>• Metal contacts on front and back provide electrical connection. |\n| **Efficiency** | Typical commercial silicon cells range from ~15 % to ~22 % efficiency. Thin‑film cells are usually lower (10–15 %) but can be cheaper and flexible. |\n| **Applications** | • Residential and commercial rooftop panels <br>• Utility‑scale solar farms <br>• Portable chargers, satellites, space probes <br>• Integrated into building materials (BIPV) |\n| **Advantages** | • Renewable, abundant energy source <br>• Low operating cost after installation <br>• Minimal environmental impact during operation |\n| **Challenges** | • Material and manufacturing costs <br>• Energy payback time (time to generate the energy used in production) <br>• Efficiency limits (Shockley–Queisser limit ~33 % for single‑junction cells) <br>• Degradation over time (module lifetime ~25–30 years) |\n\nIn short, a solar cell is a tiny, solid‑state device that harnesses photons from the sun to generate a steady flow of electric current, forming the fundamental building block of photovoltaic power systems.",

The exact formula varies by company policy, employment contract, or collective bargaining agreement. |\n| **Duration** | Can range from a few weeks to several months, depending on tenure and company policy. |\n| **Legal requirements** | In many jurisdictions, severance is not mandatory unless stipulated in a contract, collective agreement, or specific statutory provisions. Some countries have minimum severance rules (e.g., the U.S. *WARN Act* for large layoffs). |\n| **Tax treatment** | Generally taxable as ordinary income, though certain tax‑advantaged arrangements (e.g., 401(k) rollovers) may apply. |\n| **Other benefits** | Employers may also offer outplacement services, continued health‑care coverage, or a letter of recommendation. |\n\nIn short, severance pay is a negotiated or statutory payment that helps an employee bridge the gap between jobs after an involuntary separation from work.",
