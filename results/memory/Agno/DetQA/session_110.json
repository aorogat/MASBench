      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Daoists\",\"reasoning\":\"The pattern of the murders—each victim was left with a symbol that corresponds to a Daoist principle (e.g., the yin‑yang, the Five Elements, and the concept of Wu‑Wei). Additionally, forensic evidence recovered from the crime scenes included fragments of ancient Daoist scrolls and a distinctive ink that matches the pigment used in Daoist calligraphy. The investigators traced the ink to a small, clandestine Daoist sect that has been known to practice ritualistic killings as a misguided attempt to restore balance. No other suspect (Xiuming River, Moe Drawing, or Akagi Shiki) had any connection to the symbolic motifs or the specialized ink, making the Daoists the only plausible perpetrators of the serial murders.\"}",
