The killer wanted to transfer the blame to Morgan\",\"reasoning\":\"The invitation is a fabricated, anonymous letter purporting to come from the manager’s department. By making it appear as though the manager’s office sent the invitation, the killer creates a false trail that points to Morgan. This diversion is intended to shift suspicion away from the real perpetrator and onto Morgan, thereby transferring the blame. The other options either misinterpret the role of Morgan or do not explain why a false letter would be used.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Theater staff\",\"reasoning\":\"The clues point to someone with both access to the stage and a motive tied to backstage operations. The staff had the opportunity to manipulate props and lighting, and their familiarity with the theater’s layout made it easier to conceal the crime. Additionally, the pattern of the evidence—such as the placement of the weapon and the timing of the incident—aligns with a person who works behind the scenes rather than an actor, audience member, or manager.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Quin wanted to prove whether Fidel was really involved in extortion or not.\",\"reasoning\":\"Detective Quinn’s strategy was to create a controlled scenario that would force Fidel into a position where his involvement could be observed. By having Michael draft and send the extortion letter, Quinn could monitor Fidel’s reaction—whether he would respond, attempt to cover his tracks, or try to manipulate the situation. This direct test allowed Quinn to confirm Fidel’s role in the scheme without relying on circumstantial evidence alone.
