I've only seen the original It (1990) not the new one.\nSystem: ",
      "system_answer": "Hey! 🎬\n\n**It (2017)**  \n- **Plot:** The film is a remake of the 1990 classic (and the original Stephen King novel). It follows a group of childhood friends who reunite in their hometown of Derry, Maine, to confront the same malevolent entity that terrorized them as kids. This time, the creature takes the form of a terrifying clown named Pennywise, who preys on the town’s children (and adults) with a mix of supernatural powers and psychological manipulation.  \n- **Tone:** It’s a straight‑up horror movie—no stoner or comedy vibes. The film leans heavily into jump‑scares, creepy atmosphere, and the psychological terror of a childhood nightmare coming back to life.  \n- **Why it’s different from the 1990 version:** The 2017 version is more graphic and intense, with a darker, more modern take on the story. It also expands on the backstory of the town and the characters, giving the audience a deeper emotional hook.\n\nIf you’re curious about other horror films that play with similar themes (clowns, childhood trauma, supernatural terror), you might also enjoy:\n\n- **The Conjuring** (2013) – a chilling supernatural thriller.  \n- **The Babadook** (2014) – a psychological horror with a haunting mother‑child dynamic.  \n- **The Ring** (2002) – a cursed videotape that brings a slow‑burn dread.  \n- **The Shining** (1980) – a classic psychological horror set in an isolated hotel.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more recommendations or if you’re looking for something else entirely!

      "system_answer": "Sure thing! Here’s a quick rundown of each film:\n\n---\n\n### **The Hangover (2009)**\n- **Plot:**  \n  Four friends—Phil, Stu, Doug, and Alan—travel to Las Vegas for Phil’s bachelor party. They wake up the next morning with no memory of the night before, no groom, and a missing tiger. The group must retrace their wild night, piecing together clues and dealing with a series of outrageous mishaps to find the missing groom and the tiger before the wedding.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  The film blends outrageous, over‑the‑top humor with a simple “find‑the‑groom” mystery, creating a perfect mix of chaos and camaraderie.\n\n---\n\n### **The Hangover Part II (2010)**\n- **Plot:**  \n  The same group of friends travels to Bangkok for a wedding. They wake up with no memory of the previous night, a dead body, and a missing groom. The adventure escalates as they try to piece together what happened, leading to even more outrageous situations and a wild, exotic backdrop.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  It ups the stakes by taking the chaos to a new, exotic location while keeping the same comedic tone.\n\n---\n\n### **The Hangover Part III (2013)**\n- **Plot:**  \n  The trio (Phil, Stu, and Doug) are on a mission to find a missing heirloom that could save their lives. They travel to New Orleans, where they encounter a series of bizarre characters and a supernatural twist. The film continues the franchise’s blend of comedy and adventure, but with a slightly darker, supernatural edge.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  It mixes the original’s humor with a new supernatural storyline, giving the series a fresh twist.\n\n---\n\n### **Super Troopers (2001)**\n- **Plot:**  \n  A group of quirky, under‑paid state troopers in a small town are more interested in pranks and petty mischief than actual law enforcement. When a serious crime threatens their town, they must step up and use their unconventional skills to solve the case—while still pulling off their signature pranks.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  The film is a cult‑classic for its absurd humor, memorable one‑liners, and the camaraderie among the troopers. It’s a great “low‑budget, high‑fun” comedy that’s become a favorite for its off‑beat style.\n\n---\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you’d like more details or other recommendations.

Know something a little more mature but not so crude with humor? I'm okay with animated though.\nSystem: I saw The Usual Suspects (1995) for the first time last week, it wasn't half bad\nUser: It took you 23 years to see it?\nSystem: 0_0 never was a fan of action movies. Didn;t think I HAD to watch it lol\nUser: You didn't HAVE to do so. I'm joking.\nSystem: There are probably many classics that I've never seen but I'll check em out eventually.

The Usual Suspects (1995) sounds similar.\nSystem: :) Ok cool\nUser: I like The Boxtrolls (2014), Rush Hour (1998), and Life (1996) just to name a few.\nSystem: Awesome. Hope you choose one of these to enjoy. I might check out a few of them myself\nUser: I'm feeling childish, so I think I will check out Shrek (2001). There's not too many fart jokes in it, is it? Eddie Murphy better be worth it.\nSystem: ",
      "system_answer": "Hey! 🎉\n\n**Shrek (2001)** is a great pick for a light‑hearted, “childish” movie night. Here’s the low‑down:\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Fart jokes?** | Shrek has a few classic “fart” moments (think the “farting donkey” gag and the “fart‑scented” swamp scenes), but they’re not the main focus. The humor is more about word‑play, pop‑culture references, and the lovable banter between Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona. |\n| **Eddie Murphy?** | Eddie Murphy voices Donkey, and he’s a huge part of the film’s charm. His energetic, goofy delivery brings a lot of laughs and keeps the movie fun for both kids and adults. If you’re looking for a comedic voice that’s “worth it,” Murphy definitely delivers. |\n\n**Quick recap of why Shrek is a solid choice:**\n\n- **Family‑friendly humor** with a mix of slapstick, puns, and a few mild “fart” moments that are more playful than crass.  \n- **Endearing characters**: Shrek’s gruff exterior, Donkey’s endless chatter, and Fiona’s strong personality.  \n- **Pop‑culture references**: From “The Princess Bride” nods to “The Little Mermaid” mash‑ups, it’s a treasure trove of Easter eggs.  \n- **Animation style**: The 2001 CGI look is classic and still feels fresh for a quick, nostalgic watch.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for something a bit more mature but still light‑hearted, you might also enjoy:\n\n- **The Princess Bride (1987)** – a fairy‑tale adventure with witty dialogue and a bit of romance.  \n- **The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)** – Wes Anderson’s quirky, visually‑stylish comedy‑drama (great for a slightly older audience).  \n- **The Nice Guys (2016)** – a buddy‑cop comedy with a bit of noir flair and a mature sense of humor.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more suggestions or if you’re ready to dive into Shrek! Enjoy the laughs! 🚀",
