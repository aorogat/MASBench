It’s fast‑paced, full of behind‑the‑scenes footage, and the storytelling is almost cinematic. | Netflix |\n| 2 | **“My Octopus Teacher” (2020)** | Nature / Personal Journey | A filmmaker forms an unlikely bond with a wild octopus in a South African kelp forest. The visuals are stunning, and the narrative is surprisingly moving. | Netflix |\n| 3 | **“The Social Dilemma” (2020)** | Tech / Society | A sobering look at how social media platforms manipulate users. It’s engaging, well‑researched, and ends with a call to action. | Netflix |\n| 4 | **“Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” (2018)** | Biography / Culture | A touching portrait of Fred Rogers, the beloved host of *Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood*. It’s warm, nostalgic, and a gentle reminder of kindness. | Amazon Prime Video |\n| 5 | **“Free Solo” (2018)** | Adventure / Sports | If you’re in the mood for adrenaline, follow Alex Honnold’s fearless attempt to climb El Capitan without ropes. The cinematography is breathtaking. | Netflix |\n| 6 | **“The True Cost” (2015)** | Fashion / Ethics | A critical look at the global fashion industry’s environmental and social impact. It’s thought‑provoking and encourages you to rethink your wardrobe. | Amazon Prime Video |\n| 7 | **“13th” (2016)** | History / Social Justice | Ava DuVernay’s exploration of the U.S. prison system and its ties to racial inequality. It’s powerful, well‑researched, and highly relevant. | Netflix |\n| 8 | **“The Great Hack” (2019)** | Data / Politics | A deep dive into Cambridge Analytica, data privacy, and the 2016 U.S. election. It’s timely and eye‑opening. | Netflix |\n\n### Quick Tips for a Cozy Documentary Night\n1. **Set the mood** – dim the lights, grab a blanket, and maybe a snack.  \n2. **Pick a length** – if you only have a couple of hours, choose a single‑film documentary (e.g., *My Octopus Teacher*).  \n3. **Take notes** – jot down any questions or insights; it can spark great conversations later.  \n4. **Share** – if you’re watching with friends or family, discuss the film afterward—it’s a great way to deepen the experience.\n\nEnjoy your documentary binge!

      "system_answer": "Absolutely—planning a theme‑park weekend is always a blast! Below is a quick‑start guide that covers everything from choosing the right parks to making the most of your time (and money). Pick the parts that fit your vibe, and you’ll be set for a memorable adventure.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Pick Your Destination\n\n| Region | Highlights | Ideal For |\n|--------|------------|-----------|\n| **California (LA/Orange County)** | Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, Universal Studios Hollywood, Knott’s Berry Farm | Classic Disney + Hollywood thrills |\n| **Florida (Orlando)** | Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, SeaWorld, LEGOLAND | All‑in‑one resort experience |\n| **Texas (Austin/Arlington)** | Six Flags Over Texas, SeaWorld, local water parks | Southern charm + big rides |\n| **New York (NYC/NYC suburbs)** | Six Flags Great Adventure, Coney Island, nearby water parks | Urban + classic amusement |\n| **Colorado (Denver)** | Six Flags America, local state parks, outdoor adventures | Mix of rides + nature |\n\n*If you’re already in a particular state, stick with the parks there to save on travel.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Timing & Tickets\n\n| Tip | Why it matters |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **Buy tickets in advance** | Saves money, guarantees entry, and often unlocks “skip‑the‑line” passes. |\n| **Look for multi‑day or multi‑park passes** | If you’re staying a weekend, a 2‑day pass often gives better value than single‑day tickets. |\n| **Check for special events** | Halloween, fireworks, or seasonal festivals can add extra excitement (and sometimes extra cost). |\n| **Use mobile apps** | Most parks have apps that let you check wait times, book dining, and even reserve rides. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Plan Your Itinerary\n\n1. **Prioritize Must‑Do Rides**  \n   - Write down the top 5–7 attractions you can’t miss.  \n   - Use the park’s app to see real‑time wait times and plan accordingly.\n\n2. **Use Fast Pass / Express Pass**  \n   - If the park offers a virtual queue or express pass, book it early.  \n   - Some parks let you reserve a slot for a ride 24 hrs in advance.\n\n3. **Schedule Breaks**  \n   - Plan a mid‑day lunch or snack break to avoid fatigue.  \n   - Many parks have “quiet zones” or indoor attractions for a quick recharge.\n\n4. **Dining Reservations**  \n   - For character dining or popular restaurants, book 2–3 weeks ahead.  \n   - Consider “quick‑service” spots for lunch to keep the flow.\n\n5. **Nighttime Shows**  \n   - Reserve a spot for fireworks, parades, or nighttime shows.  \n   - Arrive early to secure a good viewing spot.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Packing Checklist\n\n| Category | Essentials |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Clothing** | Comfortable shoes, light layers, rain poncho (weather can change). |\n| **Gear** | Portable phone charger, water bottle, small backpack, sunscreen, hat. |\n| **Tickets & IDs** | Digital or printed tickets, ID, credit card. |\n| **Health** | Hand sanitizer, face mask (if needed), any medications. |\n| **Extras** | Earplugs (for loud rides), small blanket (for waiting in line). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Money‑Saving Hacks\n\n| Hack | How to Use It |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Bundle with hotels** | Many hotels offer discounted park tickets or free parking. |\n| **Early‑bird discounts** | Some parks give a 10–15 % discount for tickets purchased 30 days before the visit. |\n| **Group rates** | If you’re traveling with friends/family, ask for group pricing. |\n| **Food vouchers** | Look for “food & beverage” packages that include a set number of meals. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Sample Weekend Itinerary (California)\n\n| Time | Activity |\n|------|----------|\n| **Friday** | Arrive early, park, grab a quick snack. <br>Morning: Main attractions (e.g., Space Mountain, Harry Potter). <br>Lunch: Quick‑service. <br>Afternoon: Character meet‑and‑greet. <br>Evening: Dinner reservation + fireworks. |\n| **Saturday** | Repeat the same structure, but swap a few rides (e.g., try a new coaster). <br>Consider a backstage tour or a special event if available. |\n| **Sunday** | Light morning stroll, souvenir shopping, early departure. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bonus: Off‑Peak Tips\n\n- **Weekdays** (Mon‑Thu) are usually less crowded.  \n- **Early mornings** (first 2–3 hrs) or **late evenings** (after 8 pm) often have shorter lines.  \n- **Weather**: If it’s a hot day, plan indoor attractions for the midday heat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nA theme‑park weekend is all about balancing the thrill of rides with the joy of the experience. With a solid plan, you’ll spend less time waiting and more time enjoying. Have an amazing trip—let me know if you need help with specific park details or ticket links!",
