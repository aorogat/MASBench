Quinn has already identified the killer, but lacks evidence.\",\"reasoning\":\"Detective Quinn knew that Stephen Barry was the murderer but had no concrete proof.

This forced Barry to act—using the same poison he had used on Field—so that the police could catch him in the act and obtain undeniable evidence.
