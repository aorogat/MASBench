Beneficial to the body\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the window in room 238 was left open because the victim, Richard Nigges, himself opened it—likely to get fresh air or to ease his breathing as he was dying. The killer did not close it to keep the scene uniform, so the open window was a personal action by the victim rather than a deliberate staging. This explains why the window was open: it was beneficial to the body’s comfort, not a clue of suicide or a staging tactic.\"}",
