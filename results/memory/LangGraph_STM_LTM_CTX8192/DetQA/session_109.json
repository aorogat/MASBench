Investigators found no unused envelopes, paper, or stamps in Suguraya’s belongings, suggesting that the second letter was indeed written. Since it was never mailed, the logical conclusion is that Suguraya discarded it—most likely after writing it—rather than sending it elsewhere or leaving it in his room. This aligns with the detectives’ observation that the second letter was never found in the post office or in his possession, pointing to it being discarded by him.\"}",
