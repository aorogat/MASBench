      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun itself isn’t actually yellow—it emits a nearly **white** spectrum of light.  \nWhat makes the Sun look yellow to us on Earth is the way that light travels through our atmosphere:\n\n1. **Rayleigh scattering**  \n   The atmosphere contains molecules and very small particles that scatter shorter‑wavelength light (blue and violet) more strongly than longer‑wavelength light (red, orange, yellow).  \n   When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue component is scattered in all directions, leaving the remaining light that reaches our eyes richer in the longer wavelengths.\n\n2. **Air mass and viewing angle**  \n   - **At noon** (when the Sun is high in the sky) the light path through the atmosphere is short, so only a modest amount of blue is scattered away. The Sun still looks white or slightly yellowish.  \n   - **During sunrise or sunset** the light travels through a much longer path, scattering even more blue light out of the line of sight. The light that reaches us is dominated by the yellow‑red part of the spectrum, so the Sun appears orange or red.\n\n3. **Human perception**  \n   Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light, and the presence of scattered blue light can make the Sun look slightly yellowish even when it is high in the sky.\n\nSo, the Sun is essentially white; it appears yellow (or orange/red at dawn/dusk) because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters the shorter‑wavelength blue light away from our line of sight.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound and then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects such as fish, submarines, the sea floor, or other obstacles.\n\n### How sonar works\n\n| Step | What happens | Key concept |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1. **Transmission** | A transducer (speaker‑like device) sends out a sound pulse (often in the range of 1 kHz to several hundred kHz). | **Pulse‑echo** |\n| 2. **Propagation** | The sound travels through water, which transmits sound much better than air. | Speed of sound ≈ 1,500 m/s in seawater |\n| 3. **Reflection** | The pulse hits an object and reflects back toward the source. | **Echo** |\n| 4. **Reception** | The same transducer (or a separate receiver) picks up the returning echo. | **Time‑of‑flight** |\n| 5. **Processing** | The time delay between transmission and reception is converted into distance (range). The echo’s frequency shift (Doppler effect) can reveal the target’s speed. | **Range & velocity** |\n| 6. **Display** | The processed data are shown on a screen or plotted on a map, giving the operator a “picture” of the underwater environment. | **Sonar imaging** |\n\n### Types of sonar\n\n| Type | Purpose | Typical use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Navigation, fish‑finding, submarine detection, depth sounding. |\n| **Passive sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects (e.g., propeller noise). | Stealth detection, marine biology studies. |\n| **Side‑scan sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to create detailed images of the sea floor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys. |\n| **Multibeam sonar** | Sends multiple beams to map large areas quickly. | Bathymetric mapping, offshore construction. |\n\n### Applications\n\n- **Naval**: submarine detection, mine‑sweeping, navigation.\n- **Commercial**: fishing (fish‑finder), shipping navigation, offshore oil & gas.\n- **Scientific**: mapping the ocean floor, studying marine life, monitoring ice sheets.\n- **Recreational**: fishing, diving, boating.\n\n### Why it’s useful\n\n- Sound travels far in water, so sonar can detect objects hundreds or thousands of meters away.\n- It works in all visibility conditions (murky water, darkness, ice).\n- Provides real‑time information about depth, distance, and movement.\n\nIn short, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound waves instead of radio waves to “see” what lies beneath the surface.",

It is considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning the nervous system amplifies pain signals.  \n\n| Key features | Details |\n|--------------|---------|\n| **Pain** | Often described as a deep, aching, or “burning” sensation that can affect the whole body (neck, shoulders, back, hips, knees, etc.). |\n| **Tender points** | Traditionally, 18 specific spots on the body (e.g., the base of the skull, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees) are especially sensitive to pressure. |\n| **Fatigue** | Persistent tiredness that is not relieved by sleep or rest. |\n| **Sleep problems** | Many people have difficulty falling or staying asleep, and may wake up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Trouble concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, depression or anxiety, and sensitivity to light, sound, or temperature. |\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n- **Genetics**: Family history increases risk.  \n- **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger or worsen symptoms.  \n- **Infections**: Some viral or bacterial infections have been linked to onset.  \n- **Trauma**: Physical injury or emotional trauma can precipitate the condition.  \n- **Sleep disturbances**: Poor sleep quality can exacerbate pain and fatigue.\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Medical history & physical exam**: Checking for tender points and ruling out other conditions.  \n- **Criteria**: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a combination of widespread pain index and symptom severity score.  \n- **Lab tests**: Usually to exclude other diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).\n\n### Treatment\n- **Medications**:  \n  - *Pain relievers* (acetaminophen, NSAIDs).  \n  - *Antidepressants* (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran) to reduce pain and improve mood.  \n  - *Anticonvulsants* (gabapentin, pregabalin) for nerve‑related pain.  \n- **Lifestyle changes**:  \n  - Regular low‑impact exercise (walking, swimming, yoga).  \n  - Stress‑management techniques (mindfulness, CBT, relaxation).  \n  - Good sleep hygiene.  \n- **Physical therapy**: Strengthening and stretching to improve function.  \n- **Alternative therapies**: Acupuncture, massage, tai chi, and certain supplements (e.g., magnesium, vitamin D) may help some people.\n\n### Prognosis\nFibromyalgia is a lifelong condition, but symptoms can be managed. With a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and support, many people experience significant relief and can maintain an active, productive life.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that produces widespread aches, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties, often triggered or worsened by stress, injury, or infection. It is managed through a mix of medication, exercise, sleep improvement, and stress‑reduction strategies.",

Feedstock** | Raw materials (usually petroleum‑derived hydrocarbons or natural gas) are processed into simple molecules. | Ethylene, propylene, butadiene, styrene, etc. |\n| **2. Polymerization** | Monomers are linked together through chemical reactions (addition or condensation polymerization). | Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), etc. |\n| **3. Additives** | Various chemicals are mixed in to give the plastic desired properties (color, flexibility, flame resistance, etc.). | Plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, impact modifiers, flame retardants. |\n| **4. Shaping** | The polymer melt or powder is formed into the final product by extrusion, injection molding, blow‑molding, or other processes. | Bottles, containers, toys, packaging, automotive parts, etc. |\n\n### Key points\n\n- **Polymers** are long, repeating chains of atoms; the specific arrangement determines the plastic’s characteristics (rigidity, toughness, transparency, etc.).\n- **Monomers** are the building blocks; they can be derived from fossil fuels (most common) or from renewable sources (e.g., corn‑derived ethylene for some bioplastics).\n- **Additives** tailor the material for a particular use—e.g., adding a plasticizer makes PVC flexible, while a stabilizer prevents yellowing from sunlight.\n- **Recycling** involves breaking the polymer chains back into smaller fragments (often the same monomers) and re‑polymerizing them, though the process can degrade the material’s quality over time.\n\nSo, in short, plastic is made from polymer chains built from monomers, with additives and processing steps that give each type of plastic its unique properties.",

      "system_answer": "A **prism** is a solid object—usually made of glass or clear plastic—whose faces are flat and typically angled so that light entering one face is bent (refracted) as it passes through the material.  \n\n### Key features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Flat faces** | At least two faces are flat and parallel (or at a fixed angle). |\n| **Transparent material** | Commonly glass or acrylic; the material must transmit light. |\n| **Refractive index** | Determines how much the light bends; glass ≈ 1.5, plastic ≈ 1.4. |\n| **Angle between faces** | Usually 60°, 90°, or 120°, but can be any value. |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Incidence** – Light strikes the first face at some angle.  \n2. **Refraction** – The light slows down in the denser medium and bends toward the normal (Snell’s law).  \n3. **Transmission** – Light travels through the prism.  \n4. **Exit** – Light refracts again at the second face, emerging at a different direction.\n\nBecause the amount of bending depends on the wavelength, a prism can separate white light into its component colors (a spectrum). This is why prisms are used in spectrometers, binoculars, and many optical instruments.\n\n### Common types\n\n| Type | Typical use |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Triangular prism** | Splits light into a spectrum; used in spectrometers and optical devices. |\n| **Beam‑steering prism** | Directs a beam of light to a desired angle; used in laser pointers and projectors. |\n| **Prismatic lens** | Combines a lens and a prism to correct aberrations or change beam direction. |\n\n### Everyday examples\n\n- The triangular glass in a classic “prism” toy that shows a rainbow.  \n- The prism in a binocular that bends the light path to fit the eyepiece.  \n- The small prism in a camera’s viewfinder that redirects the image to the eye.\n\nIn short, a prism is a simple, flat‑sided optical element that bends light, often used to split or redirect beams for scientific, photographic, or everyday purposes.",

      "system_answer": "**Speed of sound** – the speed at which pressure waves travel through a medium.\n\n| Medium | Typical speed (at standard conditions) | Notes |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Air (sea level, 20 °C)** | **≈ 343 m/s** (≈ 1 125 ft/s, ≈ 1 235 km/h) | Depends on temperature: ≈ 331 m/s at 0 °C, increases by ~0.6 m/s per °C. |\n| **Water (20 °C)** | **≈ 1 480 m/s** | Much faster because water is denser and less compressible. |\n| **Steel (room temp)** | **≈ 5 960 m/s** | Sound travels very quickly in solids. |\n| **Human body (soft tissue)** | **≈ 1 540 m/s** | Used in medical ultrasound. |\n\n**Why it varies**\n\n- **Temperature**: In gases, sound speed ≈ √(γ R T) (γ = ratio of specific heats, R = gas constant, T = absolute temperature).  \n- **Density & compressibility**: In liquids and solids, sound speed ≈ √(E/ρ) (E = elastic modulus, ρ = density).  \n- **Medium composition**: Different gases (e.g., helium, CO₂) have different speeds.\n\n**Practical example**\n\n- At 20 °C, a sound that starts at point A will reach point B 343 m away in about **1.0 second**.  \n- In water, the same distance is traversed in roughly **0.2 seconds**.\n\nSo, the speed of sound is **≈ 343 m/s in air at room temperature**, but it can be much faster in liquids and solids, and it rises with temperature in gases.",

      "question": "What does cc in engines mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**CC** in an engine stands for **cubic centimeters**—the unit used to express the engine’s *displacement*.\n\n### What it means\n\n- **Engine displacement** is the total volume of all the cylinders in an engine, measured in cubic centimeters (cc) or liters (L).  \n- It’s calculated by multiplying the bore (diameter) by the stroke (distance the piston travels) for each cylinder, then summing across all cylinders.\n\n| Example | Formula | Result |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| 4‑cylinder engine, bore = 80 mm, stroke = 70 mm | \\(V = \\pi \\times (bore/2)^2 \\times stroke \\times 4\\) | ≈ 1 600 cc (1.6 L) |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Power & torque**: Generally, a larger displacement allows more air‑fuel mixture to be combusted, producing more power and torque (though modern engines use turbocharging, direct injection, etc., to boost performance without increasing displacement).\n- **Fuel consumption**: Bigger engines tend to consume more fuel, though efficiency improvements can offset this.\n- **Regulations & taxes**: Many countries tax or regulate vehicles based on engine displacement (e.g., “cc tax” in India).\n\n### Common usage\n\n- **Motorcycles**: 125 cc, 250 cc, 600 cc, 1000 cc, etc.  \n- **Cars**: 1.6 L (1600 cc), 2.0 L (2000 cc), 3.5 L (3500 cc), etc.  \n- **Bicycles**: “cc” is rarely used; instead, “cc” might refer to the volume of a cylinder in a small engine (e.g., a 50 cc scooter).\n\n### Quick reference\n\n| Engine size | Approx. cc | Typical vehicle |\n|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| 125 cc | 125 | Small scooter or motorcycle |\n| 250 cc | 250 | Entry‑level motorcycle |\n| 600 cc | 600 | Mid‑size motorcycle |\n| 1.0 L | 1000 | Small car or compact SUV |\n| 2.0 L | 2000 | Standard sedan |\n| 3.5 L | 3500 | Performance or luxury car |\n\n**Bottom line:** In engines, “cc” is a shorthand for cubic centimeters, the measure of the engine’s total cylinder volume, which gives a quick sense of its size and potential power.",

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": "**An ulcer** is a localized area of tissue damage in which the surface layer (epithelium) is eroded or destroyed, exposing deeper layers.  The term is most often used for two common types:\n\n| Type | Typical location | Main cause | Key symptoms |\n|------|------------------|------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic (gastric or duodenal) ulcer** | Stomach lining or first part of small intestine | • *Helicobacter pylori* infection<br>• Chronic use of NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen)<br>• Excess stomach acid | Burning epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, sometimes vomiting blood |\n| **Canker (mouth) ulcer** | Oral mucosa (inside lips, cheeks, tongue) | • Minor trauma, stress, hormonal changes, vitamin deficiencies, immune factors | Painful, shallow sore, often heals in 1–2 weeks |\n\n### How an ulcer forms\n\n1. **Barrier breakdown** – The protective mucus layer or epithelial cells are damaged.  \n2. **Acid or enzyme exposure** – In the stomach, gastric acid or pepsin erodes the tissue; in the mouth, mechanical irritation or infection does the same.  \n3. **Inflammatory response** – The body attempts to heal, but ongoing damage can keep the ulcer open.\n\n### Common risk factors\n\n- **Helicobacter pylori** infection (≈ 50 % of peptic ulcers).  \n- **NSAID use** (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen).  \n- **Smoking** and **heavy alcohol** use.  \n- **Stress** (especially in hospitalized or ICU patients).  \n- **Genetics** (family history of ulcers).  \n- **Autoimmune conditions** (e.g., Crohn’s disease).  \n\n### Diagnosis\n\n- **Endoscopy** (visual inspection of stomach/duodenum).  \n- **Biopsy** for H. pylori testing.  \n- **Urea breath test** or stool antigen test for H. pylori.  \n- **Oral exam** for canker sores.  \n\n### Treatment\n\n| Condition | Typical therapy |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Peptic ulcer** | • **Antibiotics** to eradicate H. pylori (usually 2‑drug or 3‑drug regimens).<br>• **Proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs)** (omeprazole, esomeprazole) to reduce acid.<br>• **H₂‑blockers** (ranitidine, famotidine) as alternatives.<br>• **Antacids** for symptomatic relief.<br>• **Lifestyle changes**: avoid NSAIDs, limit alcohol, quit smoking. |\n| **Canker ulcer** | • Topical numbing agents (benzocaine).<br>• Anti‑inflammatory gels (corticosteroid mouthwash).<br>• Good oral hygiene, avoid spicy/acidic foods.<br>• Treat underlying deficiencies (B12, folate, iron) if present. |\n\n### Prognosis\n\n- **Peptic ulcers**: With appropriate therapy, healing occurs in 4–8 weeks; recurrence risk is low if H. pylori is eradicated and NSAIDs avoided.  \n- **Canker ulcers**: Usually self‑limited, healing in 1–2 weeks; chronic or recurrent cases may need systemic therapy.\n\n### When to seek medical help\n\n- Severe or worsening pain, especially after eating.  \n- Vomiting blood or black, tarry stools (signs of bleeding).  \n- Persistent sore that lasts > 2 weeks.  \n- Symptoms of anemia (fatigue, pallor) or weight loss.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** An ulcer is a localized tissue erosion—most commonly a peptic ulcer in the stomach or duodenum, or a canker sore in the mouth—caused by acid, infection, medication, or trauma. It presents with pain and can be diagnosed and effectively treated with antibiotics, acid‑suppressing drugs, and lifestyle changes.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example |\n|------|--------------|---------|\n| **1. Initial deposit** | You start with a principal amount, \\(P\\). | \\$1,000 |\n| **2. Interest rate** | The account earns a rate, \\(r\\), usually expressed as an annual percentage. | 5 % per year |\n| **3.

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atoms form bonds by mixing (or “hybridizing”) their atomic orbitals to create new, equivalent orbitals that are better suited for bonding. It’s the reason why molecules like methane (CH₄) have tetrahedral shapes, water (H₂O) has a bent shape, and why carbon can form four single bonds, two double bonds, or a triple bond, all with the same valence electrons.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why hybridization is useful\n\n- **Orbital shapes**: Pure atomic orbitals (s, p, d, f) have fixed shapes that don’t always match the geometry of a molecule.\n- **Bonding directionality**: Molecules often need orbitals that point in specific directions (e.g., 90°, 109.5°, 120°) to form σ‑bonds.\n- **Energy considerations**: Mixing orbitals can lower the energy of the system, making the molecule more stable.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The basic idea\n\nAn atom’s valence electrons occupy orbitals (s, p, d). When the atom forms bonds, those orbitals can mix to produce **hybrid orbitals** that:\n\n- Are **equivalent** (same energy, same shape).\n- Are **oriented** in a way that matches the molecule’s geometry.\n- Can form σ‑bonds with other atoms.\n\nThe number of hybrid orbitals equals the number of orbitals that mix. The resulting hybrid orbitals are labeled by the type of hybridization:\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example |\n|---------------|----------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, ethylene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ (after lone‑pair adjustment) |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to determine hybridization\n\n1. **Count the regions of electron density** around the central atom (bonding pairs + lone pairs).  \n2. **Match that number** to a hybridization type:\n   - 2 → sp\n   - 3 → sp²\n   - 4 → sp³\n   - 5 → sp³d\n   - 6 → sp³d²\n3. **Adjust for lone pairs**: Lone pairs occupy the same hybrid orbitals as bonds but don’t contribute to bond angles.\n\n### Example: Water (H₂O)\n\n- Oxygen has 2 bonding pairs (to H) + 2 lone pairs = 4 regions → **sp³ hybridization**.  \n- The two lone pairs push the H–O–H bond angle down from 109.5° to ~104.5°.\n\n### Example: Ethylene (C₂H₄)\n\n- Each carbon has 3 regions (2 C–H bonds + 1 C=C double bond) → **sp² hybridization**.  \n- The double bond consists of one σ‑bond (sp²–sp²) and one π‑bond (unhybridized p–p overlap).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hybridization vs. “real” orbitals\n\n- **Hybrid orbitals** are a *model* that helps explain geometry and bonding.  \n- In reality, the electron density is a mixture of atomic orbitals; the hybridization picture is a useful approximation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common misconceptions\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|---------|\n| “Hybridization is a real physical process.” | It’s a conceptual tool; the actual electron distribution is a quantum mechanical superposition. |\n| “All atoms in a molecule are hybridized.” | Only the atoms that form bonds (usually the central atom) are described by hybrid orbitals. |\n| “Hybridization determines bond strength.” | Bond strength depends on orbital overlap, electronegativity, and other factors; hybridization mainly explains geometry. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick reference table\n\n| Atom | Regions of electron density | Hybridization | Geometry | Typical bond angles |\n|------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------|---------------------|\n| Be | 2 | sp | Linear | 180° |\n| B | 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 120° |\n| C | 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| P | 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n| S | 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 90° |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a way to describe how atoms mix their s, p, (and sometimes d) orbitals to form new, directionally oriented orbitals that match the geometry of a molecule. It explains why molecules have the shapes they do and how atoms can form multiple bonds with the same valence electrons.",

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nAfter you drink, alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream in a matter of minutes—most of it reaches the blood within **30–90 minutes** of consumption. The exact speed depends on how much you drink, how fast you drink it, whether your stomach is empty, and a few individual factors (body weight, gender, metabolism, etc.).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Where absorption happens\n\n| Site | What happens | Typical contribution |\n|------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Stomach** | Alcohol dissolves in gastric fluid and is absorbed through the stomach lining. | ~20–30 % of the total dose |\n| **Small intestine** | The majority of alcohol is absorbed here because the intestinal wall is highly vascularized. | ~70–80 % of the total dose |\n| **Large intestine** | Very little absorption; most alcohol is excreted in feces. | < 5 % |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Timing\n\n| Stage | Typical time after drinking | What you’ll feel |\n|-------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| **First absorption** | 5–10 min | Slight buzz, mild intoxication |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | 30–90 min (average ~45 min) | Highest intoxication level |\n| **Plateau** | 1–2 h | BAC may stay relatively flat if you keep drinking |\n| **Elimination** | ~1–2 h per 0.02 % BAC | Gradual return to baseline |\n\n> **Key point:** The *peak* BAC is usually reached **within the first hour** after you start drinking.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Factors that change the absorption rate\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Amount of alcohol** | Larger drinks → higher peak BAC, but the *rate* of absorption stays roughly the same. |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑proof drinks (e.g., 40 % ABV vs. 5 % beer) reach peak BAC faster. |\n| **Rate of drinking** | Sipping slowly spreads absorption over a longer period; gulping quickly spikes BAC sooner. |\n| **Food in the stomach** | Food, especially fatty or protein‑rich meals, slows gastric emptying → slower absorption. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Heavier people have more blood volume → lower peak BAC for the same dose. |\n| **Gender** | Women generally have less body water and lower alcohol‑dehydrogenase activity → higher BAC for the same dose. |\n| **Metabolism** | Genetic variations in alcohol‑dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) can speed or slow elimination. |\n| **Alcohol tolerance** | Regular drinkers may metabolize alcohol slightly faster, but absorption rate is largely unchanged. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typical numbers\n\n| Drink | Volume | ABV | Approx. time to peak BAC | Approx. peak BAC (average male) |\n|-------|--------|-----|--------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 12 oz beer (5 % ABV) | 355 mL | 5 % | 45–60 min | 0.04–0.06 % |\n| 5 oz wine (12 % ABV) | 148 mL | 12 % | 30–45 min | 0.05–0.07 % |\n| 1.5 oz spirits (40 % ABV) | 44 mL | 40 % | 20–30 min | 0.07–0.10 % |\n\n> **Note:** These are averages; individual results vary widely.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How fast is it *eliminated*?\n\n- The body metabolizes alcohol at roughly **0.015 % BAC per hour** (≈ 0.1 g of alcohol per kilogram of body weight per hour).  \n- This elimination rate is *independent* of how fast it was absorbed; it’s a separate process.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom line\n\n- **Absorption**: Most alcohol reaches the bloodstream within **30–90 minutes** after you start drinking.  \n- **Peak BAC**: Usually occurs around **45 minutes** after consumption.  \n- **Rate**: Depends on drink type, amount, rate of drinking, food, body weight, gender, and metabolism.  \n\nIf you’re planning to drive or perform tasks that require full alertness, remember that the peak intoxication window is typically within the first hour after you start drinking.",

      "question": "What is strep throat ?",
      "system_answer": "**Strep throat** is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused almost exclusively by the bacterium *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A streptococcus). It is one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adolescents, but adults can get it too.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How it happens\n\n| Step | What occurs |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Exposure** | You inhale or ingest the bacteria, often from an infected person’s cough, sneeze, or shared utensils. |\n| **Colonization** | The bacteria attach to the mucous membranes of the throat and begin to multiply. |\n| **Inflammation** | The immune system responds, causing redness, swelling, and pain. |\n| **Symptoms** | The infection spreads to the tonsils and surrounding tissues, producing the classic strep‑throat picture. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Sore throat** | Sudden, severe pain that worsens with swallowing. |\n| **Fever** | Usually > 38 °C (100.4 °F). |\n| **Red, swollen tonsils** | Often with white or yellow patches (exudates). |\n| **Tiny red spots** on the soft palate (“petechiae”). |\n| **Swollen, tender lymph nodes** in the neck. |\n| **Headache, body aches, nausea** (especially in children). |\n| **No cough or runny nose** (distinguishes it from viral sore throat). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n1. **Rapid antigen test** – Gives results in 5–15 minutes.  \n2. **Throat culture** – Gold standard; takes 24–48 hours but confirms the diagnosis and checks for antibiotic resistance.  \n3. **Clinical criteria** (e.g., Centor score) – Helps decide whether testing is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Treatment | Why it matters |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Antibiotics** (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) | Eradicates the bacteria, reduces symptoms, prevents complications (e.g., rheumatic fever), and stops contagiousness after ~24 hours. |\n| **Pain relievers** (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) | Relieve pain and fever. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Support recovery. |\n| **Avoiding irritants** (smoke, dry air) | Helps soothe the throat. |\n\n*If you’re allergic to penicillin, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) or cephalosporins are alternatives.*\n\n---\n\n## 5. When to seek medical care\n\n- Fever > 38 °C (100.4 °F) lasting > 48 hours.  \n- Severe pain or difficulty swallowing.  \n- Signs of dehydration or inability to keep fluids down.  \n- Persistent sore throat > 7 days.  \n- Any signs of complications (e.g., joint pain, rash, chest pain).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Prevention\n\n- **Hand hygiene** – Wash hands frequently, especially after coughing or sneezing.  \n- **Avoid close contact** with infected individuals.  \n- **Cover coughs/sneezes** with a tissue or elbow.  \n- **Do not share** utensils, cups, or towels.  \n- **Vaccination** – No vaccine for strep throat, but keeping up with routine vaccines (e.g., flu shot) reduces overall respiratory infections.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial infection of the throat caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It presents with a sudden, painful sore throat, fever, swollen tonsils, and tender lymph nodes, but no cough. Rapid diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are key to relieving symptoms, preventing complications, and stopping the spread.",

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": "**Poliomyelitis (polio)** is a viral disease that attacks the nervous system, most often the motor neurons that control muscle movement. It is caused by the **polio virus** (an enterovirus of the *Picornaviridae* family). The virus is usually spread through the fecal‑oral route (contaminated food or water) and can also be transmitted via respiratory droplets.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the disease works\n\n1. **Entry** – The virus infects the intestinal lining and replicates there.  \n2. **Viremia** – It then enters the bloodstream and can spread to the central nervous system (CNS).  \n3. **Neurotropism** – The virus preferentially infects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem.  \n4. **Damage** – Infected neurons die, leading to loss of muscle control.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clinical presentation\n\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (up to 3 weeks). Usually asymptomatic. |\n| **Early (non‑paralytic) phase** | Low‑grade fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild headache, nausea, and sometimes a mild rash. |\n| **Paralytic phase** | Rapid onset of muscle weakness that can progress to paralysis. Commonly affects the legs first, but can involve the arms, diaphragm, or other muscles. |\n| **Recovery** | Some patients recover fully; others may have permanent muscle weakness or paralysis. |\n\n- **Non‑paralytic polio**: ~95 % of infections; mild or no symptoms.  \n- **Paralytic polio**: ~5 % of infections; can cause permanent paralysis or death (if respiratory muscles are involved).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical assessment** of symptoms and neurological exam.  \n- **Laboratory tests**:  \n  - *Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)* or *virus isolation* from stool, throat swab, or CSF.  \n  - *Serology* (antibody detection) is less useful for acute diagnosis.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n- **Supportive care**:  \n  - Pain management, physiotherapy, and respiratory support (ventilation) if breathing is compromised.  \n  - Early use of **polio‑specific immunoglobulin** (in some countries) can reduce severity if given within 48 hours of symptom onset.  \n- **No antiviral**: There is no specific antiviral therapy for polio.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n- **Vaccination** – The cornerstone of polio control.  \n  - **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)**: given orally or by injection; used in many countries.  \n  - **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)**: live attenuated vaccine; used in mass‑campaigns in developing countries.  \n- **Sanitation** – Clean water, proper sewage disposal, and hand hygiene reduce transmission.  \n- **Surveillance** – Monitoring for cases and environmental sampling of sewage helps detect outbreaks early.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Global status\n\n- **Eradication**: Polio has been eliminated in most of the world. Only a few countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and a few islands) still report cases.  \n- **Outbreaks**: Sporadic outbreaks can still occur, especially where vaccination coverage is low.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPoliomyelitis is a viral infection that can cause paralysis by destroying motor neurons. It spreads via contaminated food or water, and most infections are mild or asymptomatic. The disease is preventable with vaccination, and global efforts have nearly eradicated it.",

They do this by using the **photovoltaic effect**—when photons from the sun hit a semiconductor material, they knock electrons loose, creating a flow of electric current.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How a solar cell works\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Photon absorption** | Light photons hit the semiconductor (usually silicon). |\n| **Electron excitation** | Photons give enough energy to free electrons from their atoms, creating electron‑hole pairs. |\n| **Charge separation** | A built‑in electric field (created by doping the semiconductor with different elements) pushes electrons toward one side and holes toward the other. |\n| **Current flow** | When the cell is connected to an external circuit, electrons flow from the negative side to the positive side, generating a current. |\n| **Voltage** | The built‑in field also creates a voltage (typically ~0.5–0.6 V per cell). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core components\n\n| Component | Function |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Semiconductor wafer** | Usually crystalline silicon (monocrystalline or polycrystalline) or thin‑film materials (CdTe, CIGS, perovskite). |\n| **Anti‑reflection coating** | Reduces reflection, letting more light enter. |\n| **Transparent conductive layer** | Allows light in while collecting electrons (often ITO or doped silicon). |\n| **Back contact** | Collects holes and completes the circuit. |\n| **Encapsulation** | Protects the cell from moisture, UV, and mechanical damage (often EVA or polycarbonate). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types of solar cells\n\n| Type | Key features |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon** | Single‑crystal wafer, high efficiency (~20–25 %), uniform color. |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon** | Multi‑crystal wafer, slightly lower efficiency (~15–18 %), cheaper. |\n| **Thin‑film** | Very thin layers of semiconductor on a substrate (glass, plastic). Lower cost, flexible, but lower efficiency (~10–12 %). |\n| **Perovskite** | Emerging technology, high efficiency (~25 % in lab), potentially low‑cost, but stability issues remain. |\n| **Multi‑junction** | Stacked cells with different bandgaps, used in space and high‑performance applications (efficiency > 40 %). |\n\n---\n\n## 4. From cell to system\n\n1. **Modules** – Several cells wired in series/parallel to produce a usable voltage and current.  \n2. **Inverters** – Convert the DC output of modules into AC for home or grid use.  \n3. **Mounting & tracking** – Panels are fixed or tracked to follow the sun, maximizing energy capture.  \n4. **Storage** – Batteries or other storage systems can hold excess energy for use when the sun isn’t shining.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Why they matter\n\n- **Renewable energy**: Solar cells provide clean, abundant electricity with no greenhouse‑gas emissions during operation.  \n- **Scalability**: From small rooftop panels to large utility‑scale solar farms.  \n- **Energy independence**: Reduces reliance on fossil fuels and enhances grid resilience.  \n- **Innovation**: Ongoing research aims to lower costs, improve efficiency, and develop flexible or building‑integrated photovoltaics.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA solar cell is a semiconductor device that turns photons from sunlight into electrical current through the photovoltaic effect. By combining many cells into modules and integrating them with inverters and storage, we can harness the sun’s energy to power homes, businesses, and even entire communities.",

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": "**Semiconductors** are materials that conduct electricity better than insulators but not as well as conductors. Their electrical conductivity can be precisely controlled by adding impurities (doping) or by changing temperature, light, or electric fields. This tunability makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | Semiconductors have a small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can be excited across this gap with modest energy, allowing current to flow. |\n| **Doping** | Adding a few atoms of a different element (e.g., phosphorus or boron in silicon) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type). This controls the number and type of charge carriers. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | A regular lattice (e.g., diamond‑like for silicon) provides a predictable electronic band structure. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Integrated circuits, solar cells, power devices | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑frequency RF, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 2.3–3.3 |\n| **Gallium nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power switches, RF | 3.4 |\n| **Perovskite (e.g., MAPbI₃)** | Emerging solar cells | ~1.5 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction: allows current in one direction. |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Uses p‑n junctions or field‑effect to amplify or switch current. |\n| **Integrated circuit (IC)** | Millions of transistors on a single silicon chip. |\n| **Photodiode / Solar cell** | Light excites electrons across the band gap, generating current. |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting photons. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why semiconductors are essential\n\n- **Miniaturization**: Tiny transistors can be packed into billions per chip, enabling smartphones, computers, and IoT devices.  \n- **Energy efficiency**: Low power consumption compared to mechanical or vacuum‑tube devices.  \n- **Versatility**: Can be engineered for specific functions—high‑speed logic, low‑power sensors, high‑power power electronics, optoelectronics, etc.  \n- **Innovation driver**: Advances in semiconductor technology (Moore’s Law, 5 nm nodes, silicon photonics) continue to push computing, communications, and energy solutions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **First semiconductor device** | 1904: German physicist Ferdinand Braun’s “photoconductor” (silicon carbide). |\n| **First transistor** | 1947: Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at Bell Labs (silicon‑germanium). |\n| **Silicon dominance** | ~90 % of integrated circuits use silicon. |\n| **Global market** | 2023 semiconductor revenue ≈ $400 billion, with a projected CAGR of ~8 % through 2030. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity lies between conductors and insulators, and whose properties can be finely tuned by doping and external stimuli. This controllability makes them indispensable for transistors, integrated circuits, solar cells, LEDs, and countless other electronic devices that power modern life.",

      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal, degenerative brain disorder that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion**.  \n\n### How it works\n- The prion protein (normally harmless) folds into a malformed shape that can induce other normal prion proteins to misfold.  \n- These misfolded proteins accumulate in the brain, forming sponge‑like holes (hence “spongiform”) and destroying brain tissue.  \n- The disease progresses slowly, with symptoms appearing months to years after infection.\n\n### Transmission\n- **In cattle**: Primarily through feed contaminated with infected animal parts (the “feed‑borne” route).  \n- **To humans**: Through consumption of infected beef products, leading to **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**, a rare but invariably fatal neurological disorder.\n\n### Key facts\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **First identified** | 1986 in the United Kingdom. |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Loss of coordination, weight loss, abnormal behavior, tremors, and eventually death. |\n| **Incidence** | Declined sharply after strict feed‑ban regulations and surveillance; now very rare in most countries. |\n| **Human risk** | Extremely low in countries with strict controls; vCJD cases are rare (tens of cases worldwide since the 1990s). |\n| **Prevention** | Bans on feeding cattle with animal protein, rigorous testing of cattle, and removal of high‑risk tissues (brain, spinal cord). |\n\n### Bottom line\nMad cow disease is a prion‑based neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can, in rare cases, be transmitted to humans through contaminated beef, causing a fatal neurological illness.
