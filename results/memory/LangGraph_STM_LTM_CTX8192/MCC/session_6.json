      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—specialized proteins (or, in a few cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms. They work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently than it would otherwise.  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Structure** | Mostly proteins composed of amino‑acid chains that fold into a specific 3‑D shape. Some enzymes are ribozymes (RNA catalysts). |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one particular substrate (or a small group of related substrates) and converts it into a specific product. |\n| **Catalytic cycle** | Enzymes bind the substrate at their active site, form a temporary enzyme‑substrate complex, and then release the product, ready to bind another substrate molecule. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by factors such as temperature, pH, inhibitors, activators, and allosteric effectors. |\n| **Role in metabolism** | Enzymes drive virtually all metabolic pathways—digestion, energy production, DNA replication, signal transduction, etc. |\n| **Kinetics** | Their activity follows Michaelis‑Menten kinetics, characterized by parameters like \\(K_m\\) (substrate affinity) and \\(V_{\\max}\\) (maximum rate). |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the workhorses of biochemistry, enabling the complex chemistry of life to occur at the speeds and conditions required for organisms to survive.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Why it’s *yellow* | What’s really happening |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | The Sun actually emits almost *white* light (a mix of all visible wavelengths). As that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering). The longer‑wavelength yellow‑red photons reach our eyes more directly, so the Sun appears yellow. |\n| **Human eye sensitivity** | Our eyes are most sensitive to green‑yellow light. Even when the Sun is white, the human visual system tends to interpret the dominant wavelengths as “yellow.” |\n| **Altitude effect** | At sunrise or sunset, the Sun’s light passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving a reddish‑orange hue. At noon, when the Sun is high, less scattering occurs, so the Sun looks more “white‑yellow.” |\n| **Instrumental & cultural factors** | Many early drawings and photographs used yellow or orange pigments to represent the Sun, reinforcing the perception. Modern high‑resolution imaging shows the Sun’s spectrum is essentially white, with a slight yellowish tint due to the Sun’s surface temperature (~5,800 K). |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is not truly yellow; it emits white light. The yellow appearance is a result of atmospheric scattering and the way our eyes perceive the remaining wavelengths.",

      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hoofed animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, deer, and many other livestock). It is caused by a member of the *Picornaviridae* family, the *Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease Virus* (FMDV).  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (often 1–3 days before lesions appear) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that break to form ulcers on the mouth, tongue, and inside the lips (hence “mouth”) <br>• Similar lesions on the feet, hooves, and teats (hence “foot”) <br>• Lameness, reduced appetite, and decreased milk production. <br>• In young animals, the disease can be more severe and may lead to death. |\n| **Impact** | • **Economic**: Losses from decreased productivity, trade restrictions, and control costs (culling, vaccination, movement bans). <br>• **Public health**: The virus is not transmissible to humans, but it can contaminate food products (meat, milk, dairy). |\n| **Control & Prevention** | • **Vaccination**: In endemic regions, regular vaccination programs are used. <br>• **Movement restrictions**: Quarantine and movement bans for infected or exposed herds. <br>• **Biosecurity**: Strict hygiene, disinfection, and controlled access to farms. <br>• **Surveillance**: Rapid detection and reporting to authorities. |\n| **Global status** | FMD is a notifiable disease under the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Many countries maintain strict control or eradication programs; outbreaks can lead to international trade bans. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of livestock, leading to significant economic losses and requiring stringent control measures.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in air, in some cases).  \n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission** – A sonar system emits a sound pulse (a “ping”) into the medium (water, air, etc.).  \n2. **Propagation** – The pulse travels outward at the speed of sound (≈ 1,500 m/s in seawater).  \n3. **Reflection** – When the pulse hits an object, part of the sound is reflected back toward the source.  \n4. **Reception** – Hydrophones (underwater microphones) or microphones pick up the echo.  \n5. **Processing** – The system measures the time delay between emission and reception, and sometimes the frequency shift (Doppler effect), to calculate distance, speed, and sometimes shape or material properties of the target.\n\n### Common Uses\n- **Navigation** – Avoiding obstacles, mapping the seafloor, and guiding ships or submarines.  \n- **Search & Rescue** – Locating submerged objects or people.  \n- **Fishing** – Detecting fish schools.  \n- **Military** – Detecting submarines, torpedoes, and underwater mines.  \n- **Scientific** – Bathymetric mapping, studying marine life, and monitoring oceanographic conditions.\n\n### Types\n- **Active sonar** – Emits a pulse and listens for echoes (most common).  \n- **Passive sonar** – Only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships).  \n- **Side‑scan sonar** – Produces detailed images of the seafloor by scanning sideways.  \n- **Multibeam sonar** – Emits multiple beams to create high‑resolution 3‑D maps.\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where light cannot reach.",

It’s not a single disease but a syndrome—meaning it’s a collection of symptoms that tend to occur together.  \n\n| What it looks like | What it feels like | Why it matters |\n|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Widespread pain** – aching in muscles, tendons, and soft tissues, often described as a “deep ache” or “burning” that can affect the whole body. | **Tender points** – specific spots (e.g., neck, shoulders, hips, knees) that hurt when pressed. | The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, work, and sleep. |\n| **Fatigue** – feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. | **Sleep disturbances** – many people have “fibro‑sleep” (sleep that’s not restorative). | Chronic fatigue can lead to mood changes, depression, and anxiety. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** – trouble concentrating, memory lapses, “brain fog.” | **Headaches** – tension‑type or migraines. | Cognitive symptoms can affect job performance and relationships. |\n| **Other symptoms** – irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, numbness, tingling, and sensitivity to temperature or noise. | **Mood swings** – anxiety, depression, irritability. | The combination of physical and mental symptoms can reduce quality of life. |\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n- **Genetics** – family history increases risk.  \n- **Stress** – physical or emotional stress can trigger or worsen symptoms.  \n- **Infections** – some people develop fibromyalgia after a viral or bacterial infection.  \n- **Trauma** – physical injury or emotional trauma can be a trigger.  \n- **Sleep problems** – poor sleep quality can exacerbate pain and fatigue.\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Physical exam** – doctor checks for tender points (traditionally 18 specific spots).  \n- **Rule out other conditions** – blood tests, imaging, or other labs to exclude arthritis, thyroid disease, etc.  \n- **Criteria** – the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a combination of pain severity, tender point count, and symptom duration.\n\n### Treatment\nThere’s no “cure,” but many people find relief with a combination of:\n\n| Approach | What it does |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Medications** | Pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin). |\n| **Exercise** | Low‑impact aerobic activity (walking, swimming, cycling) and stretching. |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening, posture training, and pain‑management techniques. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps manage pain perception, stress, and coping strategies. |\n| **Sleep hygiene** | Consistent bedtime routine, avoiding stimulants, and sometimes sleep‑medication. |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Balanced diet, stress‑reduction (yoga, meditation), and avoiding alcohol or caffeine. |\n| **Alternative therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, biofeedback, and certain supplements (e.g., magnesium, vitamin D). |\n\n### Living with Fibromyalgia\n- **Track symptoms** – a diary can help identify triggers and patterns.  \n- **Set realistic goals** – break tasks into smaller steps to avoid overexertion.  \n- **Seek support** – support groups, counseling, or online communities can provide emotional help.  \n- **Educate others** – explaining the condition to friends, family, and coworkers can reduce misunderstandings.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Fibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition that primarily causes widespread pain and fatigue. While it can be challenging to manage, a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and therapy often helps people lead active, fulfilling lives.",

The definition is based on two main measures of vision:\n\n| Criterion | What it means | Typical threshold |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | Sharpness of vision in the better‑seeing eye, even after correction (glasses or contact lenses). | **20/200 or worse** (i.e., you see at 20 ft what a person with normal vision sees at 200 ft). |\n| **Visual field** | The area you can see without moving your eyes. | **A field of less than 20°** (i.e., you can’t see more than a 20‑degree cone of vision). |\n\n### How it’s applied\n1. **Best‑corrected acuity** is measured first.  \n   - If the better eye is 20/200 or worse, the person is legally blind regardless of field.  \n2. If acuity is better than 20/200, the visual field is checked.  \n   - If the field is 20° or less, the person is legally blind.  \n3. If neither criterion is met, the person is considered “visually impaired” but not legally blind.\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Disability benefits** (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicare/Medicaid).  \n- **Transportation** (e.g., free or discounted bus/rail passes, special driving accommodations).  \n- **Employment** (e.g., accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act).  \n- **Education** (e.g., special education services, assistive technology).  \n\n### Notes\n- The exact numbers can vary slightly by country or state, but the 20/200 acuity and 20° field are the most widely used U.S. standards.  \n- “Legal blindness” does **not** mean total blindness; many people who are legally blind can still see shapes, colors, and some detail.  \n\nSo, in short: a person is legally blind if their best‑corrected visual acuity is 20/200 or worse, or if their visual field is 20° or less.",

      "question": "What does cc in engines mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**CC** in an engine stands for **cubic centimeters**—the total volume of all the cylinders in the engine. It’s a measure of the engine’s displacement, which is a key indicator of how much air/fuel the engine can move and, roughly, how much power it can produce.\n\n| What it means | How it’s used |\n|---------------|---------------|\n| **Engine displacement** | The sum of the volumes of all cylinders, expressed in cubic centimeters (cc). 1 cc = 1 mL. |\n| **Typical ranges** | • Small 4‑stroke engines: 50 cc–250 cc (e.g., scooters, small motorcycles). <br>• Mid‑size cars: 1 500 cc–2 500 cc (1.5 L–2.5 L). <br>• Large cars/ trucks: 3 000 cc–6 000 cc (3 L–6 L). |\n| **Why it matters** | • Larger displacement generally means more air/fuel can be combusted, leading to higher power and torque. <br>• It’s a quick way to compare engine sizes across brands and models. |\n| **Conversion** | 1 L = 1 000 cc. So a 2.0 L engine is 2 000 cc. |\n\n**Bottom line:** “cc” is simply a unit of volume—cubic centimeters—used to describe how big an engine’s cylinders are. It’s the engine’s displacement.",

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": "**An ulcer** is a localized area of tissue damage that results in a break or sore in a body surface that does not heal normally.  The term is most often used for two common types:\n\n| Type | Where it occurs | Typical cause | Key symptoms |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic ulcer** | Stomach lining or first part of the small intestine (duodenum) | • Infection with *Helicobacter pylori* <br>• Chronic use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) <br>• Excess stomach acid | Burning abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, sometimes vomiting blood |\n| **Pressure ulcer (bed sore)** | Skin over bony areas (e.g., heels, sacrum) | • Prolonged pressure, friction, moisture | Redness that turns into a sore, possible drainage, pain when pressure is removed |\n\n### How an ulcer forms\n1. **Damage to the protective layer** (mucosa or skin) – e.g., acid erosion, pressure, infection.  \n2. **Loss of tissue integrity** – the underlying tissue is exposed.  \n3. **Inadequate healing** – due to ongoing irritation, poor blood supply, or infection.  \n4. **Chronic open wound** – the ulcer persists and may deepen.\n\n### Common risk factors\n- **For peptic ulcers:** H. pylori infection, NSAID use, smoking, alcohol, stress.  \n- **For pressure ulcers:** Immobility, incontinence, poor nutrition, reduced sensation (e.g., neuropathy).\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Peptic ulcer:** Endoscopy, breath test for H. pylori, blood/urine tests.  \n- **Pressure ulcer:** Visual inspection, wound assessment scales (e.g., Braden Scale).\n\n### Treatment\n| Goal | Typical approach |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Stop the cause** | • Stop NSAIDs, use proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H₂ blockers. <br>• Treat H. pylori with antibiotics. <br>• Relieve pressure (special mattresses, repositioning). |\n| **Promote healing** | • Acid suppression therapy. <br>• Wound care (cleaning, dressings, debridement). |\n| **Prevent complications** | • Monitor for bleeding, perforation (peptic). <br>• Prevent infection, maintain nutrition. |\n\n### Prognosis\n- **Peptic ulcers** are usually curable with medication and lifestyle changes; recurrence is common if risk factors persist.  \n- **Pressure ulcers** can heal if pressure is relieved early, but advanced stages may require surgical debridement or grafting.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** An ulcer is an open sore that fails to heal because of ongoing damage or inadequate blood supply. The most common types are peptic ulcers in the digestive tract and pressure ulcers on the skin. Treatment focuses on removing the underlying cause, protecting the wound, and supporting the body’s healing processes.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money you invest or borrow (the *principal*), but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example |\n|------|--------------|---------|\n| **1. Start with a principal** | The initial amount of money. | $1,000 |\n| **2. Apply an interest rate** | The bank or lender adds a percentage of the current balance. | 5 % per year → $50 interest after the first year. |\n| **3. Add the interest to the principal** | The new balance becomes the base for the next period. | $1,000 + $50 = $1,050 |\n| **4. Repeat** | Each subsequent period the interest is calculated on the *new* balance. | Next year: 5 % of $1,050 = $52.50 → new balance $1,102.50 |\n\nBecause the interest is added to the principal, the amount on which you earn interest grows each period, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\n---\n\n## Key terms\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **Principal** | Original amount of money. |\n| **Rate** | The percentage at which interest is calculated (often expressed as an annual percentage rate, APR). |\n| **Period** | The time interval over which interest is calculated (year, month, day, etc.). |\n| **Compounding frequency** | How often the interest is added to the principal (annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, continuously). |\n| **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)** | The true yearly rate after accounting for compounding. |\n| **Continuous compounding** | Interest is added an infinite number of times per year, described mathematically by the exponential function \\(e^{rt}\\). |\n\n---\n\n## Formula\n\nFor a principal \\(P\\), annual interest rate \\(r\\) (as a decimal), compounding \\(n\\) times per year, and \\(t\\) years:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = amount after \\(t\\) years (principal + interest).  \n- If compounding is **continuous**, use:\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Why it matters\n\n| Scenario | Compound interest advantage |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| **Savings** | Your money grows faster than simple interest, especially over long periods. |\n| **Loans** | You pay more interest over time if the loan compounds, so it’s important to understand the compounding schedule. |\n| **Investments** | Mutual funds, bonds, and other vehicles often compound daily or monthly, boosting returns. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick example\n\nSuppose you invest $5,000 at 6 % per year, compounded quarterly, for 10 years.\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 10}\n  = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.015\\right)^{40}\n  \\approx 5000 \\times 1.8194\n  \\approx \\$9,097\n\\]\n\nYou’d end up with about **$9,097**—nearly double the original amount—thanks to compounding.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nCompound interest is the “interest on interest” that lets your money (or debt) grow faster over time. The more frequently it compounds, the greater the effect. Understanding the compounding frequency and rate is essential for making smart financial decisions.",

      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why we need hybridization\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have specific shapes and energies.  \n- In many molecules, the bonds we observe (e.g., the straight line of a C–C single bond or the 120° angles in methane) don’t match the shapes of the pure s or p orbitals.  \n- Hybridization provides a way to combine orbitals so that the resulting orbitals have the right shape and energy to form the observed bonds.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Resulting hybrid orbitals |\n|------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **1. Identify the central atom** | Determine how many bonds (and lone pairs) it forms. | Count the “electron domains.” |\n| **2. Choose the appropriate hybridization** | Based on the number of domains: |\n| | 2 domains → **sp** |\n| | 3 domains → **sp²** |\n| | 4 domains → **sp³** |\n| | 5 domains → **sp³d** |\n| | 6 domains → **sp³d²** |\n| **3. Mix orbitals** | Combine one s orbital with the appropriate number of p (and d, if needed) orbitals. |\n| **4. Form hybrid orbitals** | The new orbitals are equivalent in energy and oriented in space to match the molecular geometry. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common examples\n\n| Molecule | Domains | Hybridization | Geometry | Hybrid orbitals |\n|----------|---------|---------------|----------|-----------------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | 4 sp³ orbitals |\n| **Ethene (C₂H₄)** | 3 per C | sp² | Trigonal planar (120°) | 3 sp² + 1 p |\n| **Acetylene (C₂H₂)** | 2 per C | sp | Linear (180°) | 2 sp + 2 p |\n| **BF₃** | 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 3 sp² |\n| **PCl₅** | 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 5 sp³d |\n| **SF₆** | 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 6 sp³d² |\n\n---\n\n## 4. What the hybrid orbitals look like\n\n- **sp**: One s + one p → two linear orbitals 180° apart.  \n- **sp²**: One s + two p → three orbitals 120° apart (planar).  \n- **sp³**: One s + three p → four orbitals 109.5° apart (tetrahedral).  \n- **sp³d**: One s + three p + one d → five orbitals (trigonal bipyramidal).  \n- **sp³d²**: One s + three p + two d → six orbitals (octahedral).\n\nThese hybrid orbitals are **spatially oriented** to minimize electron‑electron repulsion, giving the molecule its observed shape.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why it matters\n\n- **Predicts bond angles**: The hybridization tells you the ideal angles (e.g., 109.5°, 120°, 180°).  \n- **Explains bond strengths**: Hybrid orbitals that mix s and p character are more tightly held to the nucleus, making bonds stronger.  \n- **Helps in molecular orbital theory**: Hybridization is a stepping‑stone to more advanced concepts like resonance and delocalization.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is the mixing of atomic orbitals (s, p, d) to produce new, equivalent orbitals that match the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules. It explains why molecules have the shapes they do and provides a useful framework for predicting bond angles and reactivity.",

Treatment\n\n| Treatment | How it works |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| **Antibiotics** (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) | Kill the bacteria, shorten illness, prevent complications, and reduce contagiousness. |\n| **Symptom relief** | Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain; saline gargles; throat lozenges. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Essential for recovery. |\n\n- **Duration**: 10 days of antibiotics; contagious for about 24 h after starting treatment (or 7 days if untreated).  \n- **When to seek care**: high fever, difficulty swallowing, rash, or if symptoms last > 48 h.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n- **Hand hygiene**: Wash hands frequently, especially after coughing or sneezing.  \n- **Avoid close contact** with infected individuals.  \n- **Cover coughs/sneezes** with a tissue or elbow.  \n- **Keep surfaces clean** (especially in schools and daycare).  \n- **Vaccines**: No vaccine for strep throat; prevention relies on hygiene and early treatment.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Incidence** | ~10–30 % of sore throats in children, 5–10 % in adults. |\n| **Peak age** | 5–15 years old. |\n| **Seasonality** | More common in winter and early spring. |\n| **Misdiagnosis** | Viral sore throats (e.g., cold, flu) are far more common; antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial infection that causes a sudden, painful sore throat and fever. It’s diagnosed with a rapid test or culture and treated with antibiotics to prevent complications and reduce contagiousness. Good hygiene and early medical care are key to managing and preventing it.",

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": "**Poliomyelitis (polio)** is a highly infectious viral disease that attacks the nervous system, most often the motor neurons that control muscle movement. The virus is spread through the fecal‑oral route (contaminated food or water) and, less commonly, by direct contact with an infected person.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the virus works\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Entry** | The poliovirus enters the body via the mouth, usually through contaminated food or water. |\n| **Replication** | It first replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa. |\n| **Viremia** | The virus then spreads through the bloodstream to various organs, including the spinal cord and brain. |\n| **Neurotropism** | In susceptible individuals, the virus infects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. |\n| **Cell death** | Infected neurons die, leading to loss of muscle control. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clinical presentation\n\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (can be 3–30 days). Usually asymptomatic. |\n| **Early symptoms** | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. |\n| **Paralytic polio** (rare, ~1 % of infections) | Sudden onset of muscle weakness or paralysis, often starting in the legs and progressing upward. |\n| **Non‑paralytic polio** | Mild flu‑like illness; no paralysis. |\n| **Post‑polio syndrome** | Years after recovery, some patients experience new weakness, fatigue, and pain. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Virus isolation** (cell culture) | Detects poliovirus in stool or throat swabs. |\n| **Serology** | Detects antibodies (IgM) against poliovirus. |\n| **PCR** | Detects viral RNA in stool or CSF. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n- **Supportive care**: Hydration, pain control, respiratory support if paralysis involves breathing muscles.  \n- **Physical therapy**: Helps maintain muscle strength and prevent contractures.  \n- **No antiviral**: There is no specific cure; treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n| Method | How it works |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). IPV is used in the U.S.; OPV is used in many other countries. |\n| **Hygiene** | Handwashing, safe drinking water, proper sanitation. |\n| **Surveillance** | Monitoring for cases to quickly identify and contain outbreaks. |\n\n- **Global eradication**: Since the 1980s, polio has been eliminated in most of the world. The last naturally occurring case of wild poliovirus was in 2014 (in Afghanistan). However, vaccine‑derived strains can still circulate in under‑immunized populations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Transmission** | Fecal‑oral; contaminated food/water; close contact. |\n| **Incidence** | < 1 % of infections cause paralysis; < 0.1 % lead to death. |\n| **Age group** | Children under 5 are most vulnerable. |\n| **Global status** | Polio is close to eradication; only a few countries still report wild poliovirus. |\n| **Historical impact** | Before vaccines, polio caused widespread paralysis and disability worldwide. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPoliomyelitis is a viral infection that can cause paralysis by destroying motor neurons. It is preventable with vaccination and good hygiene, and global efforts have nearly eliminated the disease.",

      "question": "What is solar wind ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—mostly electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It flows outward through the entire solar system, carrying with it the Sun’s magnetic field and influencing planetary magnetospheres, space weather, and the interplanetary medium.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Where does it come from?\n\n| Layer | Key properties |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Photosphere** | Visible surface of the Sun; temperature ~5,800 K. |\n| **Chromosphere** | Layer above the photosphere; temperature rises to ~20,000 K. |\n| **Corona** | Outer atmosphere; temperatures reach 1–3 million K. |\n| **Solar wind source** | The hot, ionized corona expands outward because the thermal pressure exceeds the Sun’s gravitational pull. |\n\nThe corona’s high temperature gives particles enough kinetic energy to escape the Sun’s gravity, creating the solar wind.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What does it consist of?\n\n- **Protons (hydrogen nuclei)** – ~95 % of the mass.  \n- **Electrons** – ~4 % of the mass.  \n- **Alpha particles (helium nuclei)** – ~4 % of the mass.  \n- **Trace heavier ions** – e.g., oxygen, carbon, iron (very small fractions).  \n\nAll of these particles are ionized (charged), so they are guided by magnetic fields.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How fast is it?\n\n| Region | Typical speed |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Near the Sun (1 AU)** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ (≈ 1,000–2,800 mph). |\n| **Fast solar wind** | ~800–1,200 km s⁻¹ (originates from coronal holes). |\n| **Slow solar wind** | ~300–500 km s⁻¹ (originates from the streamer belt). |\n\nThe speed varies with solar activity, the Sun’s magnetic field, and the source region on the Sun.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why does it matter?\n\n| Effect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Space weather** | Solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere, causing geomagnetic storms, auroras, and disruptions to satellites, GPS, and power grids. |\n| **Heliosphere** | The solar wind creates the heliosphere—a bubble of solar plasma that shields the solar system from interstellar material. |\n| **Planetary atmospheres** | On Mars and other bodies without strong magnetic fields, the solar wind can erode atmospheres over geological time. |\n| **Cosmic ray modulation** | The solar wind’s magnetic field deflects high‑energy cosmic rays, affecting radiation levels in space. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. How is it measured?\n\n- **Spacecraft**: Missions like **Parker Solar Probe**, **Solar Orbiter**, and **ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer)** directly sample the wind’s particles, magnetic field, and plasma waves.  \n- **Ground‑based**: Radio telescopes observe interplanetary scintillation (fluctuations in radio signals caused by solar wind density irregularities).  \n- **Magnetometers**: Measure the interplanetary magnetic field carried by the wind.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick facts\n\n- **Mass loss**: The Sun loses about **1.4 × 10¹⁴ kg** per year via the solar wind (≈ 0.0001 % of its mass).  \n- **Energy**: The kinetic energy flux at Earth’s orbit is ~1 W m⁻².  \n- **Solar cycle**: Solar wind properties (speed, density, magnetic field) vary over the 11‑year solar cycle, peaking during solar maximum.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSolar wind is a hot, ionized plasma stream flowing from the Sun’s corona at hundreds of kilometers per second. It shapes the space environment around Earth and the entire solar system, driving auroras, influencing satellite operations, and protecting us from galactic cosmic rays.",

What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | The energy difference between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). In semiconductors, this gap is small (≈ 0.1–4 eV), so a modest amount of energy (heat, light, or an electric field) can excite electrons into the conduction band. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | As temperature rises, more electrons cross the band gap, increasing conductivity. This is opposite to metals, whose conductivity decreases with heat. |\n| **Doping ability** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (dopants) can create an excess of electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type), allowing precise control of charge carriers. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs) have a crystalline lattice that supports well‑defined electronic bands. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Microprocessors, memory chips, solar cells | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑speed electronics, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 2.3–3.3 |\n| **Gallium nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, RF amplifiers, power switches | 3.4 |\n| **Indium phosphide (InP)** | High‑frequency optoelectronics | 1.35 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction allows current to flow in one direction. |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Uses a small input signal to control a larger current; the key is the p‑n or gate‑oxide interface. |\n| **Integrated circuit (IC)** | Thousands to billions of transistors on a single silicon chip, enabling CPUs, GPUs, memory, sensors, etc. |\n| **Photovoltaic cell** | Absorbs photons, creates electron–hole pairs, drives current. |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting light. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why semiconductors are essential\n\n| Reason | Impact |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Miniaturization** | Allows billions of transistors on a chip the size of a fingernail. |\n| **Energy efficiency** | Low power consumption compared to vacuum tubes or mechanical relays. |\n| **Versatility** | Can be engineered for analog, digital, RF, optical, or power applications. |\n| **Scalability** | Manufacturing processes (photolithography, doping, etching) can be scaled to mass production. |\n| **Innovation driver** | Enables everything from smartphones to AI accelerators, electric‑vehicle power electronics, and renewable‑energy systems. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick facts\n\n- **Silicon dominates**: ~ 90 % of all integrated circuits use silicon.  \n- **Global market**: The semiconductor industry is worth over **$400 billion** annually.  \n- **Supply chain**: Production involves advanced fabs, clean rooms, and a global network of suppliers (wafer fabs, equipment, raw materials).  \n- **Future trends**: 3‑nm and 2‑nm process nodes, silicon‑on‑insulator (SOI), 2‑D materials (graphene, MoS₂), and quantum‑dot LEDs.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity lies between conductors and insulators, and whose properties can be finely tuned by doping and crystal engineering. This unique combination makes them indispensable for all modern electronic devices—from microchips in phones to solar panels and LED lighting.",
