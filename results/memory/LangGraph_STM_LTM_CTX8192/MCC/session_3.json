      "system_answer": "**Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipe**\n\n*Serves 4*\n\n---\n\n### Ingredients\n\n| Ingredient | Amount |\n|------------|--------|\n| Boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts | 4 (about 6 oz each) |\n| Salt | ½ tsp (to taste) |\n| Black pepper | ¼ tsp (to taste) |\n| All‑purpose flour | ¼ cup (for dredging) |\n| Olive oil or neutral cooking oil | 2 Tbsp |\n| Butter | 2 Tbsp |\n| Dijon mustard | 2 Tbsp |\n| Fresh parsley, chopped (optional) | 1 Tbsp |\n| **Fillings** | |\n| Cooked ham slices | 4 (1 per breast) |\n| Swiss cheese slices | 4 (1 per breast) |\n| Bread crumbs (optional, for extra crunch) | ¼ cup |\n| Egg, beaten | 1 (for coating) |\n\n---\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Prep the chicken**  \n   - Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper.  \n   - Pound gently with a meat mallet or rolling pin until each breast is about ¼ inch thick.  \n   - Season both sides with salt and pepper.\n\n2. **Assemble the roulades**  \n   - Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard over each breast.  \n   - Lay a slice of ham and a slice of Swiss cheese on top.  \n   - Roll each breast tightly, securing with a toothpick or kitchen twine if needed.\n\n3. **Coat the roulades**  \n   - Set up a dredging station:  \n     - Bowl 1: beaten egg.  \n     - Bowl 2: flour.  \n     - Bowl 3: optional bread crumbs.  \n   - Dip each rolled breast first in flour, shaking off excess, then in egg, and finally in breadcrumbs (if using).  \n\n4. **Cook**  \n   - Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium‑high heat.  \n   - Add the chicken roulades and sear for 2–3 min per side until golden brown.  \n   - Reduce heat to medium, add the remaining 1 Tbsp butter, and spoon the melted butter over the chicken.  \n   - Cover the skillet and cook for an additional 8–10 min, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C).  \n\n5. **Rest & Serve**  \n   - Remove the toothpicks or twine.  \n   - Let the chicken rest for 5 min before slicing.  \n   - Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.  \n   - Serve with a side of roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a crisp green salad.\n\n---\n\n### Tips & Variations\n\n- **Cheese swap**: Gruyère or provolone work great if you prefer a different flavor.  \n- **Herb infusion**: Add a pinch of dried thyme or rosemary to the flour for extra aroma.  \n- **Sauce**: A simple pan sauce—deglaze the skillet with white wine or chicken broth, add a splash of cream, and simmer until thickened—pairs wonderfully.  \n- **Make‑ahead**: Assemble the roulades ahead of time, refrigerate, and cook when ready.  \n\nEnjoy your homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu!",

      "system_answer": "**Cool fact about LSD:**  \nLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) was first synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist **Albert Hofmann** while working at Sandoz Laboratories. He didn’t discover its psychedelic properties until 1943, when he accidentally absorbed a small amount through his fingertips and experienced a vivid, mind‑bending trip. This serendipitous “acid trip” led to the first documented psychedelic experience, and Hofmann famously described it as “the most beautiful and the most terrifying experience of my life.”",

      "question": "i want to know what the purpose of life is",
      "system_answer": "The “purpose of life” is one of the most enduring questions humanity has asked, and there isn’t a single, universally accepted answer. Different traditions—philosophical, religious, scientific, and personal—offer a variety of perspectives:\n\n| Perspective | Core Idea |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| **Religious / Spiritual** | Life’s purpose is often tied to a higher power or divine plan—e.g., to serve God, attain enlightenment, or live in harmony with a cosmic order. |\n| **Humanistic / Existential** | Purpose is self‑created. We give meaning through relationships, creativity, personal growth, and the pursuit of values that matter to us. |\n| **Biological / Evolutionary** | From a purely biological standpoint, the purpose is to survive, reproduce, and pass on genes. |\n| **Ethical / Moral** | Many argue that purpose lies in contributing to the well‑being of others—through kindness, justice, or stewardship of the planet. |\n| **Psychological** | Purpose can be a source of motivation and resilience, helping people set goals, find fulfillment, and cope with adversity. |\n\n### A Few Take‑Aways\n\n1. **It’s Personal** – What feels meaningful to one person may not to another. Your purpose can evolve over time as you learn, grow, and experience new things.\n2. **It’s Often a Process** – Many people find purpose in the journey itself—learning, helping others, creating art, or simply being present—rather than a single destination.\n3. **It Can Be Found in Small Things** – Acts of kindness, moments of connection, or moments of awe can all contribute to a sense of purpose.\n4. **It’s Not a One‑Size‑Fits‑All Answer** – You might blend ideas from different traditions, or you might find your own unique synthesis.\n\n### How to Explore Your Own Purpose\n\n- **Reflect**: Journaling, meditation, or quiet contemplation can help surface what truly matters to you.\n- **Experiment**: Try new activities, volunteer, travel, or learn a skill. Notice what feels energizing versus draining.\n- **Connect**: Talk with friends, mentors, or a counselor about what gives you a sense of meaning.\n- **Set Goals**: Even small, achievable goals can create a sense of direction and accomplishment.\n- **Revisit**: Periodically reassess your priorities; what mattered a year ago may shift as you grow.\n\nUltimately, the purpose of life is a deeply personal exploration. Many find that the act of searching itself—curiosity, growth, and connection—becomes a meaningful purpose in its own right.",

      "question": "please inform me on bad habits and overcoming them",
      "system_answer": "### Bad Habits & How to Overcome Them\n\n| Habit | Why It’s Problematic | Practical Steps to Break It |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Procrastination** | Delays important tasks, increases stress, and can lead to missed deadlines. | 1. **Set micro‑goals** – break tasks into 5‑minute chunks.<br>2. Use the **Pomodoro Technique** (25 min work + 5 min break).<br>3. Keep a visible **to‑do list** and tick items off. |\n| **Excessive Screen Time** | Can disrupt sleep, reduce productivity, and strain eyes. | 1. Use a **screen‑time tracker** (e.g., built‑in phone feature).<br>2. Set **scheduled “no‑screen” windows** (e.g., 30 min before bed).<br>3. Replace scrolling with a quick walk or stretch. |\n| **Skipping Meals / Skipping Breakfast** | Lowers energy, can lead to overeating later. | 1. Prep a simple breakfast the night before (overnight oats, fruit, yogurt).<br>2. Keep a **snack jar** with nuts or fruit to avoid skipping. |\n| **Negative Self‑Talk** | Lowers confidence, can spiral into anxiety or depression. | 1. Practice **cognitive reframing**: replace “I can’t” with “I can try.”<br>2. Keep a **gratitude journal** to shift focus to positives. |\n| **Unhealthy Eating (junk food, sugary drinks)** | Leads to weight gain, energy crashes, and long‑term health issues. | 1. Plan meals ahead; keep healthy snacks on hand.<br>2. Use the **“one‑in‑one‑out” rule**: for every junk item you buy, remove one healthy item. |\n| **Over‑committing** | Causes burnout, poor quality work, and strained relationships. | 1. Learn to say **“no”** or **“maybe later.”**<br>2. Prioritize tasks using the **Eisenhower Matrix** (urgent vs. important). |\n| **Not Getting Enough Sleep** | Impairs cognition, mood, and physical health. | 1. Set a consistent bedtime and wake‑up time.<br>2. Create a wind‑down routine (dim lights, read, avoid screens). |\n| **Smoking / Excessive Alcohol** | Health risks, addiction, and financial cost. | 1. Seek support groups (e.g., 12‑step, counseling).<br>2. Replace the habit with a healthier activity (exercise, hobby). |\n| **Avoiding Physical Activity** | Leads to weight gain, decreased energy, and health risks. | 1. Schedule a **short daily walk** (10–15 min).<br>2. Use a **fitness app** to track progress and stay motivated. |\n| **Poor Time Management** | Missed deadlines, increased stress. | 1. Use a **calendar** or planner.<br>2. Block time for specific tasks (time‑blocking).<br>3. Review and adjust weekly. |\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Action Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Habit** – Pick one that’s most affecting you.\n2. **Set a Clear Goal** – e.g., “I will stop checking my phone for 30 minutes after meals.”\n3. **Create a Trigger** – Pair the new behavior with an existing routine (e.g., “after brushing my teeth, I’ll do a 5‑minute stretch”).\n4. **Track Progress** – Use a habit‑tracking app or a simple checklist.\n5. **Reward Yourself** – Celebrate small wins (e.g., a favorite treat after a week of success).\n6. **Seek Accountability** – Share your goal with a friend or use a habit‑tracking buddy.\n\n---\n\n#### Resources\n\n- **Apps**: Habitica, Streaks, HabitBull, or the built‑in “Habits” feature on many phones.  \n- **Books**: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg.  \n- **Support**: Talk to a therapist, join a support group, or use online communities (Reddit’s r/NoFap, r/HealthyHabits, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Breaking a habit takes time and persistence. Start small, stay consistent, and celebrate each step forward. Good luck!",
