This treaty marked the formal recognition of the Norse settlers as a separate political entity—essentially the birth of the Norman identity.\n\nThus, the 10th century is when the Normans first gained a distinct, separate identity.",

What it looked like at the end\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Lexicon** | A core of Norman‑French vocabulary (e.g., *couteau*, *bouteille*, *chevalier*) mixed with a large number of English loan‑words (e.g., *crown*, *king*, *law*). |\n| **Phonology** | Pronunciation had drifted toward the English accent: the French *r* became a uvular trill or even a voiced uvular fricative, and the vowel system was simplified. |\n| **Grammar** | Retained many Norman‑French inflectional endings (e.g., *-es*, *-ent*), but increasingly used English‑style word order and prepositions. |\n| **Spelling** | Still largely French‑based, but with irregularities that reflected English influence (e.g., *council* from *conseil*). |\n\n### 2.  Where it was spoken\n\n| Region | Timeframe |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **England** | 1066–c. 1400 (official use in law, court, and literature). |\n| **Channel Islands** | 1066–18th century (last pockets of speakers). |\n| **Normandy (France)** | The dialect itself died out in the 12th century; the language that survived there was the French of the region. |\n\n### 3.  Decline and disappearance\n\n| Milestone | Impact |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **14th century** | The Black Death and the Hundred Years’ War weakened the Norman aristocracy; English began to dominate official documents. |\n| **Late 15th – 17th century** | English legal and administrative language replaced Anglo‑Norman in England. |\n| **18th century** | The last native speakers in the Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey) gradually shifted to English. |\n\n### 4.  Legacy\n\n* **Legal terms**: Many Anglo‑Norman words survive in English law (*court*, *jury*, *lawyer*).  \n* **Place‑names**: Towns and villages in England retain Norman‑derived names (*Bury*, *Chester*, *Winchester*).  \n* **Literature**: Works like *The Canterbury Tales* (written in Middle English) were influenced by the linguistic environment of Anglo‑Norman.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The Anglo‑Norman language’s final form was a Norman‑French dialect that had become deeply anglicised, used in England and the Channel Islands until the 17th century, after which it was supplanted by standard French and English.",

      "system_answer": "The most significant Norman‑era artwork that survives in churches today is **Norman Romanesque sculpture**—the carved stone reliefs that adorn the capitals, tympanum, archivolt, and other architectural elements of Norman churches.  \n\nThese stone carvings are prized for their:\n\n- **Iconography** (biblical scenes, saints, and symbolic motifs).  \n- **Stylistic features** (rounded arches, stylised foliage, and robust figures).  \n- **Historical value** (they provide the only visual record of Norman artistic conventions and the transition from Anglo‑Saxon to Norman ecclesiastical design).  \n\nSo, when you look at a Norman church, the carved stone capitals and tympanum reliefs are the key pieces of Norman art that have been preserved.",

Normandy’s cathedrals, abbeys, and courtly houses were among the first to adopt these new styles, commissioning works from local composers and hosting performances that reflected the broader Baroque innovations sweeping France.",

They settled in English monasteries—such as St. Albans, Westminster, and other Benedictine houses—where they carried with them the new system of letter‑notation and the staff that had been developed at Fécamp.
