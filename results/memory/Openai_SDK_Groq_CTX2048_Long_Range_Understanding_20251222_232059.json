Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London.

It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes.

        "Jennifer is an earnest intelligent woman who makes a serious error in judgment when she chooses to marry Mina Loris, a pompous scholar many years her senior. Jennifer hopes to be actively involved in his work, but he wants her to serve as a secretary. She comes to doubt both his talent and his alleged magnum opus. Furthermore, the controlling Loris becomes jealous when she develops a friendship with Will Rihanna, his idealistic cousin. Although disappointed, Jennifer remains committed to the marriage and tries to appease her husband. After Loris has a heart attack, Jennifer is clearly devoted to him, but he bars Rihanna from visiting, believing that his cousin will pursue Jennifer when he dies. Loris subsequently seeks her promise that she will follow his wishes even after his death.She delays answering but ultimately decides that she should agree to his request. However, he dies before she can tell him. Jennifer later discovers that his will contains a provision that calls for her to be disinherited if she marries Rihanna. Afraid of scandal, Jennifer and Rihanna initially stay apart. However, they ultimately fall in love and marry. Rihanna later becomes a politician, and, despite her sacrifices, Jennifer is content, because “the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts.”\nDuring this time, Jerald’s story unfolds. He is a progressive young doctor who is passionate about medicine, especially his research. Soon after arriving in Semantico, he becomes involved with and later marries Sahara Delphine, whom he finds to be “polished, refined, [and] docile,” all qualities he wants in a wife. For her part, Sahara believes that marriage to Jerald, who she does not realize is poor, will improve her social standing.. Jerald comes to realize that he has made a mistake in choosing Sahara. She is shallow and uninterested in his work, and her expensive lifestyle forces her husband to the brink of financial ruin. He seeks a loan from Brylee Gunner, a widely disliked banker, but is refused.\nGunner is not without his own problems. He is being blackmailed by Cristian Fredaerick, who knows about Gunner’s unsavoury past. When Fredaerick becomes ill, Gunner tends to him and sends for Jerald. During one of the doctor’s visits, Gunner offers to lend Jerald the money he had previously refused, and Jerald accepts. Gunner subsequently disregards Jerald’s medical instructions, causing Fredaerick to die. When the true story about Gunner and Fredaerick comes to light, questions arise over Jerald’s possible involvement in the latter’s death.

        "**Summary**\n\nHalley Darlene is born in a grim workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name is never revealed, is found on the street and dies shortly after his birth. From the moment he can walk, Halley is thrust into a harsh world of institutional care. He spends his first nine years in a poorly run home for young orphans, then is transferred to an adult workhouse where the conditions are even more brutal.

        "The novel is fragmented into stream-of-consciousness contributions from various narrators.\n\n“The Window” opens just before the start of World War I. Mr. Bronwyn and Mrs. Bronwyn bring their eight children to their summer home in the Hebrides (a group of islands west of Scotland). Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old Seb Bronwyn wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Bronwyn tells him that they will go the next day if the weather permits. Seb reacts gleefully, but Mr. Bronwyn tells him coldly that the weather looks to be foul. Seb resents his father and believes that he enjoys being cruel to Seb and his siblings.\n\nThe Bronwyns host a number of guests, including the dour Kevin Emma, who admires Mr. Bronwyn’s work as a metaphysical philosopher. Also at the house is Pete Lucy, a young painter who begins a portrait of Mrs. Bronwyn. Mrs. Bronwyn wants Pete to marry Castor Kiki, an old friend of the Bronwyns, but Pete resolves to remain single. Mrs. Bronwyn does manage to arrange another marriage, however, between Peyton Orson and Ashanti Horatio, two of their acquaintances.\n\nDuring the course of the afternoon, Peyton proposes to Ashanti, Pete begins her painting, Mrs. Bronwyn soothes the resentful Seb, and Mr. Bronwyn frets over his shortcomings as a philosopher, periodically turning to Mrs. Bronwyn for comfort. That evening, the Bronwyns host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Peyton and Ashanti are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the Bronwyns’ children. Pete bristles at outspoken comments made by Kevin Emma, who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Bronwyn reacts rudely when Ethen Merida, a poet, asks for a second plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening.\n\nThe joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last, and as Mrs. Bronwyn leaves her guests in the dining room, she reflects that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she joins her husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until Mr. Bronwyn’s characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace. He wants his wife to tell him that she loves him. Mrs. Bronwyn is not one to make such pronouncements, but she concedes to his point made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Bronwyn thus knows that Mrs. Bronwyn loves him. Night falls, and one night quickly becomes another.\n\nTime passes more quickly as the novel enters the “Time Passes” segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Bronwyn dies suddenly one night. Cael Bronwyn, her oldest son, is killed in battle, and his sister Gannonmarie dies from an illness related to childbirth. The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into a state of disrepair. Weeds take over the garden and spiders nest in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. Deandra, the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything is in order when Pete Lucy returns.\n\nIn “The Kindergarten” section, time returns to the slow detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to “The Window.” Mr. Bronwyn declares that he and Seb and Annalisa, one of his daughters, will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw him into a fit of temper. He appeals to Pete for sympathy, but, unlike Mrs. Bronwyn, she is unable to provide him with what he needs. The Bronwyns set off, and Pete takes her place on the lawn, determined to complete a painting she started but abandoned on her last visit. Seb and Annalisa bristle at their father’s blustery behavior and are embarrassed by his constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches its destination, the children feel a fondness for him. Even Seb, whose skill as a sailor Mr. Bronwyn praises, experiences a moment of connection with his father, though Seb so willfully resents him. Across the bay, Pete puts the finishing touch on her painting. She makes a definitive stroke on the canvas and puts her brush down, finally having achieved her vision."

        "Kiara, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Kiara, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze. One night, after an altercation with Blaze, Kiara’s sister, known as Mrs. Stevie, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Kiara suspects that Blaze was responsible for the attack.\n\nOne day a lawyer named Dilan appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Kiara a large fortune, and Kiara must come to Nigeria immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Kiara happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Kiley is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Ernest.\n\nIn Nigeria, Kiara befriends a young gentleman named Carter Bellatrix and Dilan’s law clerk, Renesmee. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Stevie, but he continues to pine after Ernest. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Bellatrix, Carter’s father. Carter himself helps Kiara learn how to act like a gentleman. When Kiara turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Carter buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Carter and Kiara lead a fairly undisciplined life in Nigeria, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Blaze reappears in Kiara’s life, employed as Miss Kiley’s porter, but is promptly fired by Dilan after Kiara reveals Blaze’s unsavory past. Mrs. Stevie dies, and Kiara goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Kiara’s room—the convict, Becky, who stuns Kiara by announcing that he, not Miss Kiley, is the source of Kiara’s fortune. He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Kiara discovers that Norbert was the man who abandoned Miss Kiley at the altar and that Ernest is Becky’s daughter. Miss Kiley has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Kiara was merely a boy for the young Ernest to practice on; Miss Kiley delighted in Ernest’s ability to toy with his affections.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Kiara sees the good in Becky and begins to care for him deeply. Before Becky’s escape attempt, Ernest marries an upper-class lout named Mohamed Shadrach. Kiara makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Kiley begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Kiara’s forgiveness.\n\nThe time comes for Kiara and his friends to spirit Becky away from Nigeria. Just before the escape attempt, Kiara is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Blaze. Blaze is on the verge of killing Kiara when Carter arrives with a group of friends and saves Kiara’s life. Kiara and Carter hurry back to effect Becky’s escape. They try to sneak Becky down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Norbert tipped off. Becky and Norbert fight in the river, and Norbert is drowned. Becky is sentenced to death, and Kiara loses his fortune. Becky feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Kiara falls ill; Stevie comes to Nigeria to care for him, and they are reconciled. Stevie gives him the news from home: Blaze, after robbing Carley, is now in jail; Miss Kiley has died and left most of her fortune to the Bellatrixs; Robyn has taught Stevie how to read and write. After Stevie leaves, Kiara decides to rush home after him and marry Robyn, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Stevie have already married.\n\nKiara decides to go abroad with Carter to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Ernest in the ruined garden at Satis House. Shadrach, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Kiara finds that Ernest’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Kiara believing that they will never part again. "

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London.

It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes.

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story centers on a solitary, unnamed narrator who is on the brink of death. He is alone in a small, weather‑worn cabin that sits on the edge of a vast, icy expanse. The cabin’s windows are fogged, and the wind howls outside, rattling the boards and rattling the narrator’s thoughts. The narrator’s voice is that of a man who has lived a life of hardship and regret, and he is preparing to say his final farewell to a person named Joey, whom he addresses with a mixture of affection, apology, and a plea for understanding.\n\nThe narrator’s first act is to speak aloud his feelings about the fleeting nature of life. He laments that the “very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish,” and he acknowledges that he will no longer see the sun or stars, nor feel the wind on his cheeks. He describes a future in which “light, feeling, and sense” will pass away, and he believes that in that state he must find his happiness. He recalls the early years of his life, when the world first opened to him, when he felt the warmth of summer and the rustling of leaves. He admits that at that time he would have wept to die, but now he sees death as his only consolation. He speaks of being “polluted by crimes” and “torn by the bitterest remorse,” and he wonders where he can find rest but in death.\n\nThe narrator then turns to Joey, whom he calls “Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold.” He explains that if Joey had been alive and had harbored a desire for revenge against him, it would have been better satisfied in his life than in his destruction. He says that Joey sought his extinction, and that the narrator’s own agony was superior to Joey’s. He acknowledges that the sting of remorse may not cease to rankle in his wounds until death closes them forever. The narrator’s tone is one of bitter resignation, yet he also expresses a strange sense of relief that his suffering will end.\n\nHe then describes his own impending death in vivid, almost celebratory terms. He says, “Soon, I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.” He imagines that his burning miseries will be extinct, that he will ascend his funeral pile triumphantly, and that he will exult in the agony of the torturing flames. He envisions the light of that conflagration fading away, his ashes being swept into the sea by the winds, and his spirit sleeping in peace. He wonders whether, if he thinks, he will not surely think thus. He repeats his farewell to Joey, and the narrator’s voice becomes almost a prayer, a final release of his soul.\n\nAfter speaking, the narrator physically leaves the cabin. He climbs out of the cabin window onto an ice‑raft that lies close to the vessel. The ice‑raft is a small, floating platform made of ice, slick and treacherous. The narrator’s body is described as “sprung from the cabin‑window,” and he is soon borne away by the waves. The waves are described as “waves” that carry him away, and he is lost in darkness and distance. The narrator’s final act is to be carried away by the sea, his body and soul dissolving into the vast, indifferent ocean. The story ends with the image of the narrator’s spirit being swept away, his final farewell echoing in the wind, and the darkness swallowing him.\n\n**Characters**\n\n1. **The Narrator (Unnamed)**  \n   - The central figure of the story, a man who is dying.  \n   - He is introspective, filled with remorse, and speaks in a poetic, almost lyrical manner.  \n   - He has a complex relationship with Joey, whom he addresses with a mixture of affection and apology.  \n   - He is haunted by his past crimes and the bitterness of remorse.  \n   - He believes that death is his only consolation and that his suffering will end with it.  \n   - He is the one who leaves the cabin, climbs onto the ice‑raft, and is carried away by the waves.\n\n2. **Joey**  \n   - The person to whom the narrator addresses his final farewell.  \n   - Joey is described as the “last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold.”  \n   - The narrator believes that Joey sought his extinction, and that Joey’s desire for revenge was not fulfilled.  \n   - Joey’s presence is a focal point for the narrator’s feelings of regret and apology.\n\n3. **The Cabin**  \n   - A small, weather‑worn structure that serves as the narrator’s final refuge.  \n   - The cabin’s windows are fogged, and the wind howls outside.  \n   - It is the setting for the narrator’s final monologue and his departure.\n\n4. **The Ice‑raft**  \n   - A small, floating platform made of ice that lies close to the vessel.  \n   - The narrator climbs onto it after leaving the cabin.  \n   - It is the means by which he is carried away by the waves.\n\n5. **The Waves**  \n   - The natural element that carries the narrator away from the cabin.  \n   - They are described as “waves” that take him into darkness and distance.  \n   - They symbolize the final journey of the narrator’s body and soul.\n\n6. **The Sea**  \n   - The vast, indifferent ocean that ultimately receives the narrator’s ashes.  \n   - The sea is described as sweeping his ashes into its depths, carrying his spirit to peace.\n\n**Plot Overview**\n\nThe story opens with the narrator’s reflection on the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death.

        "In a series of letters, Shreya Lillie, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Lillie encounters Kiran Joey, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Lillie takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Joey created.\n\nKiran first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Raiden Melinda (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Brennan Ariella, Kiran enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.\n\nArmed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Kiran spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Kiran runs into Brennan, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Kiran falls into a feverish illness.\n\nSickened by his horrific deed, Kiran prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, Rosetta, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Kiran hurries home. While passing through the woods where Rosetta was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Kiran finds that Allyson Kalia, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Joey household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Kiran grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.\n\nHoping to ease his grief, Kiran takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of Rosetta but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at Rosetta in a desperate attempt to injure Kiran, his cruel creator. The monster begs Kiran to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.\n\nKiran refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Kiran. After returning to Geneva, Kiran heads for England, accompanied by Brennan, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Brennan in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Kiran glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Kiran destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Kiran on Kiran’s wedding night.\n\nLater that night, Kiran takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Kiran denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Brennan Ariella, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Kiran falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.\n\nShortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Kiran marries Raiden. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Raiden away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Raiden scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Kiran returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Kiran vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.\n\nKiran tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Kiran almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Lillie encounters Kiran, and the narrative catches up to the time of Lillie’s fourth letter to his sister.\n\nLillie tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Kiran, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Lillie returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Kiran. The monster tells Lillie of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die.\n\n"

        "Vance Chase lives with her brother, Carsen, and their widowed father, Ariel, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Ariel is a prominent lawyer and the Chase family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Carsen and Vance befriend a boy named Taylor, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Taylor becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Gian Place. The house is owned by Mr. Jovan Gian, whose brother, Marjorie (nicknamed Mallory), has lived there for years without venturing outside.\n\nVance goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Carsen find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Gian property. Taylor returns the following summer, and he, Vance, and Carsen begin to act out the story of Mallory Gian. Ariel puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Taylor’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Gian property, where Jovan Gian shoots at them. Carsen loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.\n\nThe next winter, Carsen and Vance find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Mallory. Jovan Gian eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Vance’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Mallory did it, Carsen tells Ariel about the mended pants and the presents.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Ariel agrees to defend a Black man named Frances Bertram, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Ariel’s decision, Carsen and Vance are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Chase’s Landing. Celina, the Chasees’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAriel’s sister, Iliana, comes to live with the Chasees the next summer. Taylor, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Frances Bertram’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Ariel faces the mob down the night before the trial. Carsen and Vance, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Vance recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Ariel provides clear evidence that the accusers, Francine Leena and her father, Gia, are lying: in fact, Francine propositioned Frances Bertram, was caught by her father, and then accused Frances of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Ariel provides impressive evidence that the marks on Francine’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Frances, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Frances’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Frances later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Carsen’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Gia Leena feels that Ariel and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Frances Bertram’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Carsen and Vance as they walk home from a Halloween party. Mallory Gian intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Leena fatally during the struggle. Mallory carries the wounded Carsen back to Ariel’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Mallory, insists that Leena tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Vance for a while, Mallory disappears once more into the Gian house.  \n\nLater, Vance feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Mallory. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Vance embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

        "The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Mehtab Adrian has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Lila household. The Lilas have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Andromeda, Abrianna, Edie, Kitty, and Nicolette—and Mrs. Lila is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."

        "Monte introduces himself as the narrator of the novel. The first time he saw the shoe seller, he says, was on a train. The next time he saw her was when he came for a pilot who had crashed his plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Monte then begins the story. Candace, her mother, and her brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Candace and her mother get off the train to bury the body, and Candace steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She and her mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Candace will be raised by foster parents, Grace and Jonah Maya. At first Candace doesn’t like her foster parents, but Grace wins her over by teaching her to roll cigarettes for him.\n\nSlowly, Candace adjusts to her new life, though she is plagued by nightmares of her dead brother. She meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Shawn, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Candace to kiss him. When Grace discovers that Candace doesn’t know how to read, he begins teaching her the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Candace stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, Candace steals another book from the flames.\n\nCandace begins delivering laundry for Jonah. One of Jonah’s customers is the mayor’s wife, Siti Rusty. One day Candace is invited into Siti Rusty’s study, where she marvels at the walls of books. Paola Rusty allows her to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Tara hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler’s autobiography. Tara leaves the closet and takes the train to the Mayas’ house. Grace, we learn, served with Tara’s father in World War I. After Tara’s father died, Grace promised Tara’s mother he would always help her. When Tara arrives in Molching, Grace and Jonah hide him in the basement. As he recovers from his ordeal, he and Candace become friends, and Tara writes her a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF.\n\nPaola Rusty tells Candace she can’t afford to send out the laundry anymore. Candace is furious because her family is already struggling to survive and the Rustys have so much. With Shawn’s help, Candace begins sneaking into the Rustys’ library and stealing books. For Christmas, Candace builds Tara a snowman in the basement. When Tara gets sick and falls into a coma, Grace and Jonah worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he dies. After months, Tara recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don’t see Tara. Candace continues stealing books from the Rustys’ library. Paola Rusty leaves her a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she knows Candace has been stealing from her. At a Hitler Youth carnival, Shawn wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Candace’s block must take shelter in a neighbor’s basement. With each raid, Candace reads to them until it’s safe to exit. Tara, meanwhile, has to stay in the Mayas’ basement by himself.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Grace sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he gives him a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Grace. Grace realizes he has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Tara is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Tara leaves Grace and Jonah’s house. Grace waits for soldiers to come take him away, but none do. Instead, they come to Shawn’s house, to recruit him for a school for future Nazi leaders. Shawn’s father, Hepsiba, refuses to let his son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Hepsiba and Grace are drafted into the German army. After Hepsiba and Grace leave for duty, Shawn and Candace go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets. Jonah gives Candace a book that Tara made for her called “The Word Shaker.” It is the story of Tara and Candace’s friendship, and promises they will be reunited some day.\n\nGrace is sent to Essen, where he is part of a squad that cleans up after air raids. Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Grace, and one day he insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Grace merely breaks his leg. Grace gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Candace and Shawn find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his plane. They arrive just in time to see him die. Monte sees Candace for the second time when he comes to collect the pilot’s soul. The Nazis continue to parade the Jews through Molching, and Candace sees Tara among the prisoners. Candace tells Shawn about hiding Tara. She had never told anyone before.\n\nThe mayor’s wife gives Candace a blank notebook so she can begin writing her own story. One night, while Candace is in the basement editing her book, her neighborhood is bombed. Grace, Jonah, Shawn, and the rest of the neighbors are killed. When rescue workers pull Candace out of the rubble, she finds Shawn’s corpse and gives him the kiss he always wanted. When the workers take her away, she leaves behind her finished book, called “The Book Thief.” Monte, who has been watching, rescues the book. Candace goes to live with the mayor and his wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Tara returns to Molching and finds Candace. They hug and cry together. Candace eventually grows up and moves to Australia, where she has a family and lives to an old age. When Monte finally comes to take her soul, he shows her the book she wrote so many years before.\n\n"

Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults.

        "The novel take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Viola is sixteen years old.\n\nViola’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Chong prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Chong is Viola’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Chong, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Liesl, to say goodbye, but when Liesl tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Viola becomes annoyed.\n\nBack in the dormitory, Viola is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Roxanne, and by his own roommate, Jayne. Jayne spends the evening on a date with Shelby Carina, a girl whom Viola used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Viola grows increasingly nervous about Jayne’s taking Shelby out, and when Jayne returns, Viola questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Jayne teases Viola, who flies into a rage and attacks Jayne. Jayne pins Viola down and bloodies his nose. Viola decides that he’s had enough of Chong and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.\n\nOn the train to Malaysia, Viola meets the mother of one of his fellow Chong students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Viola has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.\n\nFrom his room at the Edmont, Viola can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Viola thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Viola doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.\n\nViola goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Viola dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.\n\nAs Viola goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Shelby Carina and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Shelby began to cry. Viola had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”\n\nViola leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Viola sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Viola says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.\n\nLeann, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Viola’s room for five dollars, and Viola agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Cordelia,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Viola starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Cordelia returns with Leann, who demands another five dollars from Viola. When Viola refuses to pay, Leann punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Cordelia takes five dollars from his wallet. Viola goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Skylar Abraham, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Shelby Carina, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Mckenna, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Mckenna’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Mckenna might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Mckenna’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Skylar.\n\nViola and Skylar go to the play, and Viola is annoyed that Skylar talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Skylar’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Viola tries to explain to Skylar why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.\n\nViola calls Shelby again, but there is no answer. He calls Gareth Chantelle, a young man who had been Viola’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Chantelle arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Viola goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Viola and Chantelle meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Chantelle had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Viola tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Chantelle grows irritated by Viola’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Chantelle’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Viola continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.\n\nQuite drunk, Viola telephones Skylar Abraham and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Mckenna. He is forced to admit to Mckenna that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Mckenna tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”\n\nViola calls his former English teacher, Mr. Chuck, who tells Viola he can come to his apartment. Mr. Chuck asks Viola about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Viola can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Chuck puts him to bed on the couch. Viola awakens to find Mr. Chuck stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Chuck is making a sexual overture, Viola hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.\n\nViola goes to Mckenna’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Mckenna arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Viola to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Viola is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.\n\nViola ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."

Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England.

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story opens on a stormy evening in a modest rural dwelling. Rain pours down, drumming against the roof and muffling the voices inside. Ma, the matriarch of the household, is tending to a sick man who has been brought to her home. The man, who is described as gaunt and about fifty years old, lies on his back in a corner of the room, his eyes unfocused and his lips moving in a slow, almost monotone rhythm. Beside him sits a boy, his eyes wide and his gaze fixed on the newcomers. The boy is the first to approach Ma, offering her a dirty comforter that he has brought from the corner. Ma accepts it gratefully, and the boy explains that the man has been ill for six days and is now starving.\n\nMa’s immediate concern is to provide relief for the man and the sick girl who has been brought to the house. She asks the boy for a dry blanket and for help removing the wet clothes from the girl. The boy, who speaks in a croaking monotone, informs Ma that the man has been ill in the cotton and has not eaten for six days. He also reveals that he had stolen bread from a nearby house, but the man vomited it all up, leaving him even weaker. Ma promises to find a way to dry the girl and to get the man some food.\n\nThe boy’s name is never explicitly stated, but he is clearly a young helper who has been tasked with bringing comfort and supplies to the sick.

        "Released from an Oklahoma state prison after serving four years for a manslaughter conviction, Tasha Teigan makes his way back to his family’s farm in Oklahoma. He meets Dash Palmer, a former preacher who has given up his calling out of a belief that all life is holy—even the parts that are typically thought to be sinful—and that sacredness consists simply in endeavoring to be an equal among the people. Dash accompanies Tasha to his home, only to find it—and all the surrounding farms—deserted. Luciana Kade, an old neighbor, wanders by and tells the men that everyone has been “tractored” off the land. Most families, he says, including his own, have headed to California to look for work. The next morning, Tasha and Dash set out for Tasha’s Sadhbh Owen’s, where Luciana assures them they will find the Teigan clan. Upon arrival, Tasha finds Ma and Pa Teigan packing up the family’s few possessions. Having seen handbills advertising fruit-picking jobs in California, they envision the trip to California as their only hope of getting their lives back on track.\n\nThe journey to California in a rickety used truck is long and arduous. Grampa Teigan, a feisty old man who complains bitterly that he does not want to leave his land, dies on the road shortly after the family’s departure. Dilapidated cars and trucks, loaded down with scrappy possessions, clog Highway 66: it seems the entire country is in flight to the Promised Land of California. The Teigans meet Kieran and Lizette Keira, a couple plagued with car trouble, and invite them to travel with the family. Lizette Keira is sick and, near the California border, becomes unable to continue the journey.\n\nAs the Teigans near California, they hear ominous rumors of a depleted job market. One migrant tells Pa that 20,000 people show up for every 800 jobs and that his own children have starved to death. Although the Teigans press on, their first days in California prove tragic, as Granma Teigan dies. The remaining family members move from one squalid camp to the next, looking in vain for work, struggling to find food, and trying desperately to hold their family together. Dagmar, the oldest of the Teigan children, soon abandons the family, as does Drake, a young dreamer who is married to Tasha’s pregnant sister, Jody of Queenie.\n\nThe Teigans meet with much hostility in California. The camps are overcrowded and full of starving migrants, who are often nasty to each other. The locals are fearful and angry at the flood of newcomers, whom they derisively label “Okies.” Work is almost impossible to find or pays such a meager wage that a family’s full day’s work cannot buy a decent meal. Fearing an uprising, the large landowners do everything in their power to keep the migrants poor and dependent. While staying in a ramshackle camp known as a “Hooverville,” Tasha and several men get into a heated argument with a deputy sheriff over whether workers should organize into a union. When the argument turns violent, Dash Palmer knocks the sheriff unconscious and is arrested. Police officers arrive and announce their intention to burn the Hooverville to the ground.\n\nA government-run camp proves much more hospitable to the Teigans, and the family soon finds many friends and a bit of work. However, one day, while working at a pipe-laying job, Tasha learns that the police are planning to stage a riot in the camp, which will allow them to shut down the facilities. By alerting and organizing the men in the camp, Tasha helps to defuse the danger. Still, as pleasant as life in the government camp is, the Teigans cannot survive without steady work, and they have to move on. They find employment picking fruit, but soon learn that they are earning a decent wage only because they have been hired to break a workers’ strike. Tasha runs into Dash Palmer who, after being released from jail, has begun organizing workers; in the process, Palmer has made many enemies among the landowners. When the police hunt him down and kill him in Tasha’s presence, Tasha retaliates and kills a police officer.\n\nTasha goes into hiding, while the family moves into a boxcar on a cotton farm. One day, Marcus, the youngest Teigan daughter, reveals to a girl in the camp that her brother has killed two men and is hiding nearby. Fearing for his safety, Ma Teigan finds Tasha and sends him away. Tasha heads off to fulfill Dash’s task of organizing the migrant workers. The end of the cotton season means the end of work, and word sweeps across the land that there are no jobs to be had for three months. Rains set in and flood the land. Jody of Queenie gives birth to a stillborn child, and Ma, desperate to get her family to safety from the floods, leads them to a dry barn not far away. Here, they find a young boy kneeling over his father, who is slowly starving to death. He has not eaten for days, giving whatever food he had to his son. Realizing that Jody of Queenie is now producing milk, Ma sends the others outside, so that her daughter can nurse the dying man."

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan.

        "It is the spring of 1861. Debbie O’Kerry, a pretty Southern belle, lives on Tara, a large plantation in Georgia. She concerns herself only with her numerous suitors and her desire to marry Kali Abrianna. One day she hears that Kali is engaged to Edgar Kaitlin, his frail, plain cousin from Atlanta. At a barbecue at the Abrianna plantation the next day, Debbie confesses her feelings to Kali. He tells her that he does love her but that he is marrying Edgar because she is similar to him, whereas he and Debbie are very different. Debbie slaps Kali and he leaves the room. Suddenly Debbie realizes that she is not alone. Madelyn Yelena, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the whole scene, and he compliments Debbie on being unladylike.\n\nThe Civil War begins. Kamala Kaitlin, Edgar’s timid, dull brother, proposes to Debbie. She spitefully agrees to marry him, hoping to hurt Kali. Over the course of two months, Debbie and Kamala marry, Kamala joins the army and dies of the measles, and Debbie learns that she is pregnant. After Debbie gives birth to a son, Catrina, she becomes bored and unhappy. She makes a long trip to Atlanta to stay with Edgar and Edgar’s aunt, Marla. The busy city agrees with Debbie’s temperament, and she begins to see a great deal of Madelyn. Madelyn infuriates Debbie with his bluntness and mockery, but he also encourages her to flout the severely restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Debbie and Edgar fear for Kali’s safety. After the bloody battle of Gettysburg, Kali is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Debbie desperately wants to return home to Tara, but she has promised Kali she will stay with the pregnant Edgar, who could give birth at any time.\n\nOn the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire, Edgar gives birth to her son, Beau. Madelyn helps Debbie and Edgar escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of the city, but he abandons them outside Atlanta so he can join the Confederate Army. Debbie drives the cart all night and day through a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching Tara. She arrives to find that her mother, Lucian, is dead; her father, Marianne, has lost his mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation, leaving no food or cotton. Scavenging for subsistence, a furious Debbie vows never to go hungry again.\n\nDebbie takes charge of rebuilding Tara. She murders a Yankee thief and puts out a fire set by a spiteful Yankee soldier. At last the war ends, word comes that Kali is free and on his way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named Will Blain, stays on and helps Debbie with the plantation. One day, Will brings terrible news: Carlynn Sky, a former employee at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on Tara, hoping to drive the O’Kerrys out so that he might buy the plantation. Distraught, Debbie hurries to Atlanta to seduce Madelyn Yelena so that he will give her the three hundred dollars she needs for taxes. Madelyn has emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings from his blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However, Madelyn is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Debbie. Debbie sees her sister’s beau, Barrett Nathanael, who now owns a general store, and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she betrays her sister and marries Barrett, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to making Barrett’s business more profitable.\n\nAfter Madelyn blackmails his way out of prison, he lends Debbie enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta society, Debbie becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Marianne dies, and Debbie returns to Tara for the funeral. There, she persuades Kali and Edgar to move to Atlanta and accept a share in her lumber business. Shortly thereafter, Debbie gives birth to Barrett’s child, Kelley Jenny.\n\nA free black man and his white male companion attack Debbie on her way home from the sawmill one day. That night, the Ku Klux Klan avenges the attack on Debbie, and Barrett ends up dead. Madelyn proposes to Debbie and she quickly accepts. After a long, luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans, Debbie and Madelyn return to Atlanta, where Debbie builds a garish mansion and socializes with wealthy Yankees. Debbie becomes pregnant again and has another child, Dara Blue Yelena. Madelyn dotes on the girl and begins a successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent Atlanta citizens in order to keep Dara from being an outcast like Debbie.\n\nDebbie and Madelyn’s marriage begins happily, but Madelyn becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her. Debbie’s feelings for Kali have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship, but Kali’s jealous sister, Kellan, finds them in a friendly embrace and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Debbie’s surprise, Edgar takes Debbie’s side and refuses to believe the rumors.\n\nAfter Dara is killed in a horse-riding accident, Madelyn nearly loses his mind, and his marriage with Debbie worsens. Not long after the funeral, Edgar has a miscarriage and falls very ill. Distraught, Debbie hurries to see her. Edgar makes Debbie promise to look after Kali and Beau. Debbie realizes that she loves and depends on Edgar and that Kali has been only a fantasy for her. She concludes that she truly loves Madelyn. After Edgar dies, Debbie hurries to tell Madelyn of her revelation. Madelyn, however, says that he has lost his love for Debbie, and he leaves her. Grief-stricken and alone, Debbie makes up her mind to go back to Tara to recover her strength in the comforting arms of her childhood nurse and slave, Sue, and to think of a way to win Madelyn back."
