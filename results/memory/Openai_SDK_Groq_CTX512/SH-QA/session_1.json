Instead, they were organized into a patchwork of petty kingdoms, chieftaincies, and later, more centralized realms.

      "question": "What was the Anglo-Norman language's final form?",
      "system_answer": "**Anglo‑Norman’s “final form”** is best understood as the *Late Anglo‑Norman* stage that prevailed from the late‑13th to the early‑15th century.  It was the last coherent, written variety of the language before it was eclipsed by Middle English.  Below is a quick sketch of what that final stage looked like, how it was used, and why it eventually disappeared.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  When and Where?\n\n| Period | Key Dates | Main Users | Typical Documents |\n|--------|-----------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Early Anglo‑Norman** | 1066–1200 | Norman aristocracy, clergy, royal court | Charters, chronicles, law codes |\n| **Middle Anglo‑Norman** | 1200–1300 | Royal administration, legal system | Patent Rolls, Close Rolls, legal treatises |\n| **Late Anglo‑Norman** | 1300–1450 | Court, chancery, ecclesiastical courts | Chancery‑style writs, legal glosses, literary works |\n\nThe *Late Anglo‑Norman* period is the one that most scholars refer to when they talk about the “final form” of the language.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Linguistic Features of Late Anglo‑Norman\n\n| Feature | Description | Example |\n|---------|-------------|---------|\n| **Phonology** | Retained many Norman French consonant clusters; began to show the loss of the final *-e* in many words (e.g., *cheval* → *cheval*). | *cheval* “horse” pronounced /ʃavɑl/ |\n| **Morphology** | Still used French inflectional endings (e.g., *les chevaliers*), but with increasing simplification. | *les chevaliers* “the knights” |\n| **Lexicon** | Heavy influx of English words, especially in legal and administrative contexts (e.g., *court*, *law*, *judge*). | *law* “law” (from Old English *lagu*) |\n| **Syntax** | Began to show English‑like word order in some contexts, but remained largely French‑based. | *Le roi a donné le livre* “The king gave the book” |\n| **Orthography** | Still largely French spelling conventions, but with some English influence (e.g., *council* spelled *council*). | *council* “council” |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why It Fell Out of Use\n\n1. **The Black Death (1348‑1350)** – Drastic population loss weakened the Norman aristocracy that maintained the language.\n2. **The Hundred Years’ War (1337‑1453)** – English national identity grew; the French‑speaking elite were increasingly seen as “foreign.”\n3. **The rise of Middle English** – English became the dominant language of law, literature, and everyday life. The *Chancery Standard* (late 15th c.) was an English variant that replaced Anglo‑Norman in official documents.\n4. **Legal Reforms** – The *Statute of Pleading* (1362) required that all legal proceedings be conducted in English, effectively ending Anglo‑Norman’s legal role.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  The “Final Form” in Practice\n\n- **Legal Writs**: The *Patent Rolls* and *Close Rolls* of the 14th century are written in Late Anglo‑Norman. They show a blend of French legal terminology with English words for local matters.\n- **Literature**: Works like *The Book of the Courtier* (c. 1400) are in Late Anglo‑Norman, reflecting courtly culture.\n- **Church Records**: Ecclesiastical documents (e.g., *Papal Bulls* addressed to English bishops) were still in Late Anglo‑Norman until the 15th c.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Aftermath\n\nBy the mid‑15th century, Anglo‑Norman had largely vanished from official use. The language’s legacy lives on in:\n\n- **Legal Vocabulary**: Words like *court*, *judge*, *law*, *jury*.\n- **Place‑Names**: Many English place‑names retain Norman roots (e.g., *Birmingham*, *Oxford*).\n- **Cultural Influence**: The Norman court’s customs, cuisine, and architecture shaped English society.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe **final form of Anglo‑Norman** was the *Late Anglo‑Norman* stage (c. 1300‑1450), a French‑based dialect heavily infused with English vocabulary and used primarily in legal, administrative, and literary contexts.  It gradually gave way to Middle English as the dominant language of England, leaving behind a rich but ultimately short‑lived linguistic legacy.",

      "system_answer": "**Norman architecture** is the architectural idiom that developed in the 11th‑ and 12th‑century Norman territories (Normandy in France, the Norman‑conquered parts of England, and the Crusader states).  It is a regional variant of the broader Romanesque style, but it has its own distinct vocabulary of forms, proportions, and decorative motifs.  The “idiom” can be summed up in a handful of key characteristics:\n\n| Feature | What it looks like | Why it matters |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Massive, thick walls** | Walls often 1–2 m thick, built of large stone blocks or ashlar. | Gives the buildings a solid, fortress‑like feel and allows for large interior spaces. |\n| **Semicircular (round) arches** | Doorways, windows, arcades, and barrel vaults all use the classic Romanesque round arch. | The arch distributes weight efficiently and is a hallmark of Romanesque/Norman design. |\n| **Large, square or round towers** | Often at corners of churches or castles; sometimes a central tower in cathedrals. | Adds vertical emphasis and a sense of strength; towers were also defensive. |\n| **Decorative arcading and blind arcades** | Rows of small arches on walls, often with carved stone. | Adds rhythm and texture to otherwise plain surfaces. |\n| **Chevron (zig‑zag) and scallop motifs** | Carved into capitals, lintels, and corbels. | A signature Norman decorative theme, especially in the 12th‑century. |\n| **Large, simple windows** | Small, narrow windows with minimal tracery; sometimes a single large window in a tower. | Limited light but creates dramatic interior illumination. |\n| **Use of stone vaulting** | Barrel vaults and groin vaults in nave and transept. | Provides fire‑resistance and structural stability. |\n| **Symmetrical plans** | Many churches follow a Latin cross plan with a clear axial layout. | Reflects the Norman emphasis on order and hierarchy. |\n| **Integration of fortification elements** | In castles and fortified churches, walls, battlements, and arrow slits are incorporated. | Demonstrates the dual religious‑military role of many Norman buildings. |\n\n### Typical examples\n\n| Country | Building | Year | Notes |\n|---------|----------|------|-------|\n| England | Durham Cathedral | 1093–1153 | One of the finest examples of Norman Romanesque in England. |\n| England | St. Mary’s Church, Southampton | 12th c. | Shows the chevron motif and massive walls. |\n| France | Notre‑Dame de la Garde, Caen | 11th c. | Early Norman church with simple round arches. |\n| England | Tower of London (original keep) | 1078 | Combines Norman military architecture with stone construction. |\n| England | St. Peter’s Church, Westminster | 12th c. | Demonstrates the use of blind arcading and chevron decoration. |\n\n### In short\n\nThe Norman architectural idiom is a **massive, stone‑built, Romanesque style** that emphasizes **round arches, thick walls, large towers, and distinctive decorative motifs** such as chevrons and scallops.  It was used for churches, cathedrals, castles, and fortified towns across Normandy, England, and the Crusader states, leaving a legacy of some of the most iconic medieval buildings in Europe.",

      "question": "What monastery did the Saint-Evroul monks establish in Italy?",
      "system_answer": "The monks of **Saint‑Evroul Abbey** founded a daughter house in Italy called the **Abbey of San Benedetto in Monte** (sometimes simply “San Benedetto”).  \nIt was established in the early 12th century (around 1120) in the province of **Pistoia, Tuscany**. The foundation was part of the broader Norman‑Benedictine expansion into Italy, and the abbey remained an important religious and cultural center for several centuries.",

      "system_answer": "The monks of Saint‑Evroul were **supported by the local feudal lord, Count Guido of Monte** (sometimes called Guido I of the Monte family).  \n- **Count Guido** granted them the land on which the Abbey of San Benedetto in Monte was built and provided the initial endowment of timber, stone, and livestock.  \n- He also secured the protection of the surrounding territory, allowing the monks to settle and cultivate the site.  \n\nIn addition, the **Bishop of Pistoia** gave the necessary ecclesiastical approval and helped secure the abbey’s rights to collect tithes and receive donations from the local populace. Together, these patrons ensured the successful establishment and early stability of the Saint‑Evroul community in Italy.",

      "system_answer": "The single measure that most directly captures a problem’s inherent difficulty is its **time‑complexity** (often expressed asymptotically, e.g., O(n²), O(2ⁿ), etc.).  \n\nIn computational complexity theory, the time‑complexity of the fastest algorithm that solves a problem (in the worst case) determines the problem’s placement in a complexity class (P, NP, EXP, etc.).  Thus, the time‑complexity function is the primary metric that broadly defines how hard a computational problem is to solve.",
