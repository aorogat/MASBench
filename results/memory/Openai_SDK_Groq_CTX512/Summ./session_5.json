      "question": "Write a summary of about 1000 to 1200 words. Only write about the plot and characters of the story. Do not discuss the themes or background of the book. Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "### The “Best” Way to Learn a New Language  \nThere isn’t a one‑size‑fits‑all answer—what works best depends on your goals, learning style, schedule, and the language itself. Below is a practical framework that blends the most effective strategies, plus a few “quick‑wins” you can start right away.\n\n| Goal | Why it matters | How to do it | Quick‑Start Tips |\n|------|----------------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Build a solid foundation** | Grammar, core vocabulary, and pronunciation give you a launchpad for everything else. | • Take a beginner course (online or in‑person). <br>• Use spaced‑repetition systems (SRS) like Anki or Memrise. <br>• Practice pronunciation with native‑speaker audio or a pronunciation app (e.g., Elsa Speak). | • Start with 10‑15 min daily. <br>• Use a “one‑word‑a‑day” habit to seed your Anki deck. |\n| **Immerse yourself** | Real‑world usage forces you to think in the language and improves listening/reading fluency. | • Watch movies/TV shows with subtitles in the target language. <br>• Listen to podcasts, radio, or music. <br>• Read news, blogs, or books at your level. | • Pick a favorite show and watch it once in your native language, then again in the target language. |\n| **Practice speaking** | Speaking is the hardest skill to master; early, regular practice reduces anxiety and builds muscle memory. | • Language‑exchange partners (Tandem, HelloTalk, ConversationExchange). <br>• Join local meet‑ups or online conversation groups (Discord, Meetup). <br>• Use a “shadowing” technique: repeat after native speakers. | • Record yourself for 1 min each day and compare to a native speaker. |\n| **Use the language actively** | Writing and speaking reinforce memory and help you internalize grammar. | • Keep a daily journal in the target language. <br>• Post on language‑learning forums (Reddit r/LanguageLearning, Duolingo forums). <br>• Teach a concept you’ve learned to someone else. | • Write a short paragraph about your day and get it corrected on Lang-8 or HiNative. |\n| **Set clear, measurable goals** | Goals give direction and a sense of progress. | • Use the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time‑bound. <br>• Example: “I will hold a 5‑minute conversation with a native speaker by the end of month 3.” | • Write your goals on a sticky note and place it where you’ll see it daily. |\n| **Track progress** | Seeing improvement keeps motivation high. | • Keep a learning log (Google Sheet, Notion, or a simple notebook). <br>• Log hours, new words, and milestones. | • Celebrate every 50‑word milestone with a small reward. |\n| **Adapt to your learning style** | Everyone absorbs information differently. | • Visual learners: use color‑coded notes, mind maps. <br>• Auditory learners: podcasts, audio books. <br>• Kinesthetic learners: role‑play, flashcard games. | • Try a 2‑week “style‑swap” experiment: if you’re a visual learner, try an audio‑only course for a week and see how it feels. |\n| **Leverage technology** | Apps and AI can personalize and accelerate learning. | • Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone for structured lessons. <br>• Anki for spaced repetition. <br>• ChatGPT or language‑model tutors for instant feedback. | • Use ChatGPT to practice dialogues or ask for grammar explanations. |\n| **Stay consistent, not intense** | Consistency beats marathon sessions. | • Aim for 15–30 min daily, or 3–5 min 10× a day. <br>• Use “micro‑learning” bursts during commutes or breaks. | • Set a daily reminder on your phone to “learn 5 new words.” |\n| **Immerse culturally** | Language is tied to culture; understanding context deepens fluency. | • Cook a recipe in the target language. <br>• Follow a local news outlet. <br>• Attend cultural events or virtual tours. | • Watch a cooking show in the target language and try the recipe. |\n\n---\n\n## A Sample 30‑Day Plan (for a beginner)\n\n| Day | Focus | Activity |\n|-----|-------|----------|\n| 1‑3 | **Foundations** | Sign up for a beginner course (Duolingo or a free YouTube playlist). |\n| 4‑7 | **Vocabulary** | Create an Anki deck of 50 common words. Review daily. |\n| 8‑10 | **Listening** | Watch a 10‑min episode of a children’s show in the target language. |\n| 11‑13 | **Speaking** | Find a language partner on Tandem; chat for 5 min. |\n| 14‑16 | **Writing** | Write a 3‑sentence diary entry. Post on HiNative for correction. |\n| 17‑20 | **Grammar** | Complete a beginner grammar lesson (e.g., present tense). |\n| 21‑23 | **Pronunciation** | Use a pronunciation app; record yourself. |\n| 24‑26 | **Culture** | Watch a documentary about the country. |\n| 27‑29 | **Review** | Go through Anki, redo the grammar lesson, practice speaking again. |\n| 30 | **Assessment** | Record a 1‑minute self‑talk; compare to a native speaker. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick‑Wins for Immediate Motivation\n\n1. **Add a language to your phone** – change your device’s language to the target one.  \n2. **Label household items** – put sticky notes with the word in the target language on objects.  \n3. **Use a language‑learning streak** – set a daily streak goal in Duolingo or Anki.  \n4. **Join a community** – Reddit r/LanguageLearning, Discord language servers, or local meet‑ups.  \n5. **Celebrate small wins** – treat yourself after every milestone (e.g., a coffee, a new book).\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n| Pitfall | Why it hurts | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| **Skipping speaking** | You’ll never get comfortable with real conversation. | Schedule a weekly speaking session. |\n| **Overloading** | Burnout and forgetting. | Stick to 15–30 min daily. |\n| **Ignoring culture** | Language is context‑dependent. | Watch cultural content, read local news. |\n| **Relying on one resource** | You’ll miss out on different angles. | Mix apps, books, podcasts, and people. |\n| **Not tracking** | You won’t see progress. | Keep a simple log or use an app that tracks hours. |\n\n---\n\n## Final Thought\n\nThe “best” way is the one that keeps you **consistent, engaged, and curious**. Mix structured study with real‑world exposure, practice speaking early, and celebrate every small victory. Over time, the language will become a natural part of your daily life. Happy learning!",
      "gold_answer": "Vance Chase lives with her brother, Carsen, and their widowed father, Ariel, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Ariel is a prominent lawyer and the Chase family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Carsen and Vance befriend a boy named Taylor, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Taylor becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Gian Place. The house is owned by Mr. Jovan Gian, whose brother, Marjorie (nicknamed Mallory), has lived there for years without venturing outside.\n\nVance goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Carsen find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Gian property. Taylor returns the following summer, and he, Vance, and Carsen begin to act out the story of Mallory Gian. Ariel puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Taylor’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Gian property, where Jovan Gian shoots at them. Carsen loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.\n\nThe next winter, Carsen and Vance find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Mallory. Jovan Gian eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Vance’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Mallory did it, Carsen tells Ariel about the mended pants and the presents.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Ariel agrees to defend a Black man named Frances Bertram, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Ariel’s decision, Carsen and Vance are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Chase’s Landing. Celina, the Chasees’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAriel’s sister, Iliana, comes to live with the Chasees the next summer. Taylor, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Frances Bertram’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Ariel faces the mob down the night before the trial. Carsen and Vance, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Vance recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Ariel provides clear evidence that the accusers, Francine Leena and her father, Gia, are lying: in fact, Francine propositioned Frances Bertram, was caught by her father, and then accused Frances of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Ariel provides impressive evidence that the marks on Francine’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Frances, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Frances’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Frances later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Carsen’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Gia Leena feels that Ariel and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Frances Bertram’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Carsen and Vance as they walk home from a Halloween party. Mallory Gian intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Leena fatally during the struggle. Mallory carries the wounded Carsen back to Ariel’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Mallory, insists that Leena tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Vance for a while, Mallory disappears once more into the Gian house.  \n\nLater, Vance feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Mallory. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Vance embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness.",
