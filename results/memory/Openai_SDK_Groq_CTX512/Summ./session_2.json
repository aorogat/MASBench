Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a practical, step‑by‑step guide that covers the most common ways to turn a photo (or a set of photos) into a fully‑editable 3D model in Blender.  \nI’ll split it into two main approaches:\n\n| Approach | When to use | Typical workflow | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|-------------|------------------|------|------|\n| **Photogrammetry** (multiple photos) | You have a decent number of photos from many angles (≈10‑30+). | 1. Capture photos  <br>2. Run photogrammetry software (Meshroom, RealityCapture, Agisoft Metashape, COLMAP) <br>3. Export mesh/texture <br>4. Import into Blender, clean up, retopologize, UV unwrap, paint | Very realistic geometry & texture; works for objects, faces, full bodies | Requires many photos, can be heavy on GPU/CPU, mesh can be messy |\n| **Single‑image AI reconstruction** | Only one photo is available, or you want a quick “look‑alike” model. | 1. Use an AI tool (e.g., NVIDIA Omniverse, Adobe Photoshop 3D, MakeHuman, Daz 3D, or online services like 3DF Zephyr AI, Smoothie‑3D, or the new “3D model from image” features in Midjourney/Stable Diffusion) <br>2. Export to OBJ/FBX <br>3. Import into Blender, tweak, sculpt | Fast, no need for many photos | Geometry is often low‑poly or generic; textures may be rough; less control over details |\n| **Manual modeling from reference** | You want full artistic control or the subject is too complex for photogrammetry. | 1. Import photo(s) into Blender as background images <br>2. Use them as reference while modeling (mesh, sculpt, retopology) <br>3. Texture with UVs or use procedural materials | Full control, can create stylized or stylized models | Time‑consuming, requires modeling skill |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Photogrammetry – The “gold standard” for realistic models\n\n### 1.1. Capture the photos\n\n| Tip | Why it matters |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **Use a tripod** | Keeps camera steady, reduces motion blur. |\n| **Shoot in RAW** | Gives you more latitude in post‑processing. |\n| **Overlap 60‑80 %** | Photogrammetry algorithms need overlapping features. |\n| **Vary the angle** | Include close‑ups of key details (eyes, mouth, hands). |\n| **Good lighting** | Avoid harsh shadows or over‑exposure; use diffused light. |\n| **Background** | A plain, neutral background (green screen or white wall) helps the software isolate the subject. |\n\n### 1.2. Choose a photogrammetry pipeline\n\n| Software | Cost | Notes |\n|----------|------|-------|\n| **Meshroom** | Free | Open‑source, runs on GPU, great for beginners. |\n| **RealityCapture** | Paid (free trial) | Very fast, high‑quality output. |\n| **Agisoft Metashape** | Paid (free trial) | Excellent for texture mapping. |\n| **COLMAP** | Free | Command‑line, but powerful; good for research. |\n\n**Quick Meshroom workflow**\n\n1. **Import**: Drag all photos into the “Images” node.  \n2. **Reconstruction**: Add “Structure from Motion” → “Dense Reconstruction” → “Texture Mapping”.  \n3. **Export**: Use the “Export Mesh” node to get an OBJ/FBX with textures.  \n4. **Check**: Open the exported file in Blender to confirm geometry and texture.\n\n### 1.3. Clean up in Blender\n\n1. **Import** the OBJ/FBX.  \n2. **Delete** unnecessary parts (e.g., background mesh).  \n3. **Retopologize** (if needed) – use the **Retopology** add‑on or the built‑in **BMesh** tools.  \n4. **UV unwrap** – usually the photogrammetry export already has UVs, but you may need to tweak them.  \n5. **Texture painting** – use the **Texture Paint** workspace to fix seams or add details.  \n6. **Sculpt** – if you want to add muscle definition or smooth out noise.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. AI‑based single‑image reconstruction\n\nIf you only have one photo, you can still get a decent model quickly.\n\n### 2.1. Tools to try\n\n| Tool | Output | How to get it into Blender |\n|------|--------|----------------------------|\n| **NVIDIA Omniverse** (e.g., **Omniverse Create** + **Omniverse AI**) | 3‑D mesh + texture | Export as USD → import into Blender via the **USD importer** |\n| **Adobe Photoshop 3D** | 3‑D mesh | Export as OBJ/FBX |\n| **MakeHuman / Daz 3D** | Base human mesh | Export as OBJ/FBX |\n| **Online services** (e.g., **Smoothie‑3D**, **3DF Zephyr AI**, **Zygote 3D**) | Low‑poly mesh | Download OBJ/FBX |\n| **Stable Diffusion 3D** (e.g., **DreamStudio 3D** or **Midjourney 3D** plugins) | 3‑D mesh | Export as OBJ/FBX |\n\n### 2.2. Typical workflow\n\n1. **Upload** the photo to the chosen AI tool.  \n2. **Adjust** settings (e.g., “detail level”, “face refinement”).  \n3. **Generate** the mesh.  \n4. **Export** as OBJ/FBX.  \n5. **Import** into Blender.  \n6. **Refine**:  \n   * Use **Sculpt Mode** to fix missing details.  \n   * Use **Retopology** if the mesh is too dense or has irregular topology.  \n   * Paint or bake textures if the AI output is low‑resolution.\n\n### 2.3. Tips for better results\n\n- **High‑resolution photo** (≥ 4 MP) gives the AI more data.  \n- **Clear background** helps the AI isolate the subject.  \n- **Avoid extreme poses** – the AI struggles with occluded limbs or faces.  \n- **Post‑process**: Use Blender’s **Remesh** modifier to clean up noise before sculpting.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Manual modeling from reference\n\nWhen you need full artistic control or the subject is too complex for photogrammetry, manual modeling is the way to go.\n\n### 3.1. Set up reference images\n\n1. **Open Blender** → **Add** → **Image** → **Reference**.  \n2. Load the front, side, and top views (or any angles you have).  \n3. Use the **N‑panel** to adjust the image’s opacity and lock it to the viewport.\n\n### 3.2. Start with a base mesh\n\n- **Use a primitive** (cube, sphere, cylinder) and shape it.  \n- **Use the “MakeHuman” add‑on** for a quick human base.  \n- **Use a low‑poly template** from BlenderKit or TurboSquid.\n\n### 3.3. Sculpt and refine\n\n1. **Sculpt**: Use the **Sculpt Mode** to add muscle, facial features, and fine details.  \n2. **Retopology**: If you sculpted a high‑poly mesh, use the **Retopology** add‑on to create a clean, animation‑ready mesh.  \n3. **UV unwrap**: Use **Smart UV Project** or manual seams for better texture control.  \n4. **Texture**: Paint in Blender or use an external program (Substance Painter, Quixel Mixer).\n\n### 3.4. Workflow example\n\n| Step | Tool | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|\n| 1 | **Add > Mesh > Cube** | Start with a cube, then use **Edit Mode** to shape the torso. |\n| 2 | **Sculpt > Grab** | Roughly shape the head. |\n| 3 | **Sculpt > Crease** | Add muscle definition. |\n| 4 | **Retopology** | Use the **Retopology** add‑on to create a clean mesh. |\n| 5 | **UV Unwrap** | Mark seams on the face and body. |\n| 6 | **Texture Paint** | Paint skin tones, add freckles, etc. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Exporting and re‑importing between tools\n\n| Format | Best for | Notes |\n|--------|----------|-------|\n| **OBJ** | General purpose | Keeps geometry & UVs, but no armature or materials. |\n| **FBX** | Animation pipelines | Keeps armatures, materials, and animation data. |\n| **USD** | Omniverse, Pixar pipelines | Very flexible, supports layers and metadata. |\n| **GLTF/GLB** | Web, real‑time engines | Compact, includes textures. |\n\nWhen moving from photogrammetry or AI tools to Blender, always:\n\n1. **Check normals** – flip if they’re pointing inward.  \n2. **Remove duplicate vertices** – use **Mesh → Clean up → Merge by Distance**.  \n3. **Scale** – make sure the model is in the correct units (Blender default is meters).  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick‑start checklist\n\n1. **Decide**: Do you have many photos? One photo? Need realism or stylization?  \n2. **Capture** (if you’re taking photos).  \n3. **Choose software**: Meshroom for free, RealityCapture for speed, or an AI tool for single‑image.  \n4. **Export** to OBJ/FBX.  \n5. **Import into Blender**.  \n6. **Clean up**: Delete background, merge vertices, fix normals.  \n7. **Retopologize** (if needed).  \n8. **UV unwrap**.  \n9. **Texture** (paint or bake).  \n10. **Sculpt** for final details.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Resources & tutorials\n\n| Resource | Link | What you’ll learn |\n|----------|------|-------------------|\n| **Meshroom tutorial** | https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/wiki | Step‑by‑step photogrammetry workflow. |\n| **RealityCapture workflow** | https://www.capturingreality.com/ | High‑quality texture mapping. |\n| **Blender retopology add‑on** | https://github.com/keijiro/Retopology | Easy retopology in Blender. |\n| **Blender sculpting basics** | https://www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/quick-sculpting | Sculpting fundamentals. |\n| **MakeHuman** | https://www.makehumancommunity.org/ | Free human base mesh generator. |\n| **NVIDIA Omniverse AI** | https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse | AI‑driven 3D reconstruction. |\n| **Adobe Photoshop 3D** | https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/3d.html | Create 3D from a single image. |\n| **Smoothie‑3D** | https://smoothie-3d.com/ | Free online single‑image 3D modeling. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **For realistic, high‑detail models**: Capture many photos → photogrammetry → Blender.  \n- **For quick, low‑poly models**: Use an AI tool on a single photo → Blender.  \n- **For full artistic control**: Manual modeling with reference images → Blender.\n\nPick the method that best matches your time, resources, and the level of realism you need.

      "gold_answer": "The novel is fragmented into stream-of-consciousness contributions from various narrators.\n\n“The Window” opens just before the start of World War I. Mr. Bronwyn and Mrs. Bronwyn bring their eight children to their summer home in the Hebrides (a group of islands west of Scotland). Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old Seb Bronwyn wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Bronwyn tells him that they will go the next day if the weather permits. Seb reacts gleefully, but Mr. Bronwyn tells him coldly that the weather looks to be foul. Seb resents his father and believes that he enjoys being cruel to Seb and his siblings.\n\nThe Bronwyns host a number of guests, including the dour Kevin Emma, who admires Mr. Bronwyn’s work as a metaphysical philosopher. Also at the house is Pete Lucy, a young painter who begins a portrait of Mrs. Bronwyn. Mrs. Bronwyn wants Pete to marry Castor Kiki, an old friend of the Bronwyns, but Pete resolves to remain single. Mrs. Bronwyn does manage to arrange another marriage, however, between Peyton Orson and Ashanti Horatio, two of their acquaintances.\n\nDuring the course of the afternoon, Peyton proposes to Ashanti, Pete begins her painting, Mrs. Bronwyn soothes the resentful Seb, and Mr. Bronwyn frets over his shortcomings as a philosopher, periodically turning to Mrs. Bronwyn for comfort. That evening, the Bronwyns host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Peyton and Ashanti are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the Bronwyns’ children. Pete bristles at outspoken comments made by Kevin Emma, who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Bronwyn reacts rudely when Ethen Merida, a poet, asks for a second plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening.\n\nThe joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last, and as Mrs. Bronwyn leaves her guests in the dining room, she reflects that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she joins her husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until Mr. Bronwyn’s characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace. He wants his wife to tell him that she loves him. Mrs. Bronwyn is not one to make such pronouncements, but she concedes to his point made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Bronwyn thus knows that Mrs. Bronwyn loves him. Night falls, and one night quickly becomes another.\n\nTime passes more quickly as the novel enters the “Time Passes” segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Bronwyn dies suddenly one night. Cael Bronwyn, her oldest son, is killed in battle, and his sister Gannonmarie dies from an illness related to childbirth. The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into a state of disrepair. Weeds take over the garden and spiders nest in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. Deandra, the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything is in order when Pete Lucy returns.\n\nIn “The Kindergarten” section, time returns to the slow detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to “The Window.” Mr. Bronwyn declares that he and Seb and Annalisa, one of his daughters, will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw him into a fit of temper. He appeals to Pete for sympathy, but, unlike Mrs. Bronwyn, she is unable to provide him with what he needs. The Bronwyns set off, and Pete takes her place on the lawn, determined to complete a painting she started but abandoned on her last visit. Seb and Annalisa bristle at their father’s blustery behavior and are embarrassed by his constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches its destination, the children feel a fondness for him. Even Seb, whose skill as a sailor Mr. Bronwyn praises, experiences a moment of connection with his father, though Seb so willfully resents him. Across the bay, Pete puts the finishing touch on her painting. She makes a definitive stroke on the canvas and puts her brush down, finally having achieved her vision.",
