The leading “3” can be interpreted as indicating the third person with those initials, and the trailing “wM” signals that the name includes an M (Hamnet contains an M).

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Partial color blindness\",\"reasoning\":\"Dr. Aless is described in the source material as having difficulty distinguishing certain hues—particularly reds and greens—yet he can still perceive a full spectrum of colors. This limitation is consistent with partial (deuteranomaly or protanomaly) color blindness rather than a complete loss of color vision or any other sensory impairment.
