The police only recovered one letter in the mailbox, implying the other envelope was indeed mailed but did not arrive at the expected mailbox. The most plausible explanation is that the post office misdirected or forwarded the second letter to a different address (or held it for delivery), so it never appeared in the mailbox. Options A and B would mean the envelope was never mailed, contradicting the presence of stamps, while option D suggests the envelope was disassembled, which is unlikely for a standard postal process.
