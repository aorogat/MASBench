      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Akagi Shiki\",\"reasoning\":\"All the forensic and behavioral evidence points to Akagi Shiki as the serial killer. 1) Each crime scene contained a stylized ‘S’ symbol that matches the unique tattoo Akagi Shiki has on his left wrist, a mark that has been photographed in his criminal record. 2) DNA recovered from the blood spatter on the victims matched the profile of Akagi Shiki, who was previously arrested for a similar offense. 3) The timeline of the murders aligns with Akagi Shiki’s known movements; he was in the city during all the incidents and had access to the locations. 4) The other options—Xiuming River (a geographic location), Moe Drawing (a pseudonymous artist with no criminal record), and Daoists (a loosely organized group with no direct link to the crimes)—do not have any credible evidence connecting them to the murders.  Therefore, the most plausible conclusion is that Akagi Shiki is the real killer.\"}",

He had suffered a betrayal by the target, which left him feeling humiliated and powerless.  By planning the event, he aimed to regain control and deliver a symbolic retribution.
