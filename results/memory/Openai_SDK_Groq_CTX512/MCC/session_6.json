      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "### Target Heart Rate (THR)\n\n**Target heart rate** is the range of heart‑beat counts per minute (beats per minute, bpm) that you aim to stay within during aerobic exercise. It’s a practical way to gauge how hard your heart is working and to ensure you’re exercising at an intensity that matches your fitness goals.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Use a Target Heart Rate?\n\n| Goal | Typical THR Zone | Why It Matters |\n|------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Weight loss / calorie burn** | 50–70 % of maximum heart rate (MHR) | Burns a higher proportion of calories from fat. |\n| **Cardiovascular fitness** | 70–85 % of MHR | Improves heart‑lung efficiency, increases VO₂ max. |\n| **Endurance training** | 60–75 % of MHR | Builds aerobic base without excessive fatigue. |\n| **High‑intensity interval training (HIIT)** | 80–95 % of MHR (short bursts) | Maximizes anaerobic capacity and metabolic stress. |\n\nUsing a THR helps you:\n\n- **Stay safe** – avoid over‑exertion or under‑exertion.\n- **Track progress** – see if you’re improving your aerobic capacity.\n- **Tailor workouts** – adjust intensity to match specific training phases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to Calculate Your Target Heart Rate\n\n### Step 1: Estimate Your Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)\n\nThe most common formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MHR} = 220 - \\text{age}\n\\]\n\n*Example:* A 35‑year‑old → 220 – 35 = 185 bpm.\n\n> **Note:** The 220‑age rule is a rough estimate. For more precision, you can use the **Tanaka formula** (MHR = 208 – 0.7 × age) or conduct a graded exercise test under medical supervision.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Your Target Zone\n\n| Intensity | % of MHR | Typical Activity |\n|-----------|----------|------------------|\n| Light | 50–60 % | Walking, light cycling |\n| Moderate | 60–70 % | Brisk walking, easy jogging |\n| Hard | 70–80 % | Running, vigorous cycling |\n| Very Hard | 80–90 % | Sprinting, HIIT |\n| Max | 90–100 % | Short, all‑out effort |\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[\n\\text{THR}_{\\text{low}} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{lower\\%} \\\\\n\\text{THR}_{\\text{high}} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{upper\\%}\n\\]\n\n*Example:* 35‑year‑old, moderate zone (60–70 %):  \n- Low: 185 × 0.60 = 111 bpm  \n- High: 185 × 0.70 = 130 bpm  \n→ **Target zone: 111–130 bpm**\n\n### Step 3: Monitor Your Heart Rate\n\n- **Manual check:** Count beats for 15 seconds, multiply by 4.  \n- **Heart‑rate monitor:** Chest strap or wrist‑based sensor (smartwatch, fitness band).  \n- **Smartphone apps:** Many can read from a compatible sensor.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Tips\n\n| Tip | Explanation |\n|-----|-------------|\n| **Warm‑up & cool‑down** | Start and finish outside the target zone to reduce injury risk. |\n| **Use a heart‑rate monitor** | Provides real‑time feedback; reduces guesswork. |\n| **Adjust for medications** | Beta‑blockers lower heart rate; use perceived exertion (RPE) as a backup. |\n| **Re‑calculate MHR every 5–10 years** | Aging changes your MHR; keep your target zone accurate. |\n| **Combine with RPE** | Borg Scale (6–20) or 0–10 scale can complement heart‑rate data. |\n| **Consider fitness level** | Beginners may start at the lower end of a zone; advanced athletes can push higher. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Common Misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| “Higher heart rate always burns more calories.” | Not necessarily; lower‑intensity, longer sessions can burn more total calories. |\n| “Target heart rate is the same for everyone.” | It’s individualized; age, fitness, medication, and health status all influence it. |\n| “You must stay in the zone the whole workout.” | It’s fine to vary intensity (e.g., intervals, tempo runs) as long as you hit the zone during key portions. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick Reference Table (Age 20–60)\n\n| Age | MHR (220‑age) | 50–60 % | 60–70 % | 70–80 % | 80–90 % |\n|-----|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 20 | 200 | 100–120 | 120–140 | 140–160 | 160–180 |\n| 30 | 190 | 95–114 | 114–133 | 133–152 | 152–171 |\n| 40 | 180 | 90–108 | 108–126 | 126–144 | 144–162 |\n| 50 | 170 | 85–102 | 102–119 | 119–136 | 136–153 |\n| 60 | 160 | 80–96 | 96–112 | 112–128 | 128–144 |\n\n*(Values are rounded to the nearest whole number.)*\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nTarget heart rate is a simple, science‑backed tool that lets you exercise at the right intensity for your goals. By estimating your maximum heart rate, defining a target zone, and monitoring your heart rate during workouts, you can train more effectively, stay safe, and track your progress over time.",

      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—proteins (or, in a few cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins made of one or more polypeptide chains folded into a specific 3‑D shape.  The active site—where the substrate binds—is a pocket or groove that matches the substrate’s shape and chemical properties. |\n| **Function** | They lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed at a much faster rate under physiological conditions.  This is essential for metabolism, DNA replication, signal transduction, and many other cellular processes. |\n| **Mechanism** | 1. **Substrate binding** – the substrate fits into the active site (lock‑and‑key or induced‑fit model).  <br>2. **Transition‑state stabilization** – the enzyme stabilizes the high‑energy transition state.  <br>3. **Product release** – the product is released, and the enzyme is ready for another cycle. |\n| **Classification** | Enzymes are grouped by the type of reaction they catalyze (EC system): <br>• **Oxidoreductases** (e.g., dehydrogenases) <br>• **Transferases** (e.g., kinases) <br>• **Hydrolases** (e.g., proteases) <br>• **Lyases** <br>• **Isomerases** <br>• **Ligases** |\n| **Regulation** | Enzymes are regulated by: <br>• **Allosteric effectors** (activators or inhibitors binding at sites other than the active site) <br>• **Covalent modification** (phosphorylation, acetylation) <br>• **Gene expression** (amount of enzyme produced) <br>• **Feedback inhibition** (product of a pathway inhibits an upstream enzyme) |\n| **Examples** | • **Amylase** – breaks down starch into sugars. <br>• **DNA polymerase** – synthesizes DNA strands. <br>• **Phenylalanine hydroxylase** – converts phenylalanine to tyrosine (key in PKU). |\n| **Importance** | Without enzymes, most biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to sustain life.  They enable the complex, highly regulated chemistry that underpins metabolism, growth, and adaptation. |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the “workhorses” of biochemistry—highly specific, efficient catalysts that make life possible.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nThe Sun itself emits almost *white* light.  We see it as yellow because of the way Earth’s atmosphere scatters the shorter (blue) wavelengths and because our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the Sun actually emits\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Surface temperature | ~5 800 K |\n| Spectral type | G2V |\n| Emitted spectrum | Roughly a black‑body curve peaking in the green‑yellow part of the visible spectrum (≈ 500 nm) |\n| Net color (outside Earth’s atmosphere) | White (a mix of all visible wavelengths) |\n\nThe Sun’s spectrum is continuous; it contains all colors, but the intensity is highest in the green‑yellow region.  If you could look at the Sun from space, it would appear white (or very slightly yellowish‑white).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why we see yellow on Earth\n\n### 2.1 Rayleigh scattering\n\n- **Mechanism:** Molecules and small particles in the atmosphere scatter light.  The scattering intensity ∝ 1/λ⁴ (λ = wavelength).\n- **Effect:** Shorter wavelengths (blue, violet) are scattered far more strongly than longer wavelengths (red, yellow).\n- **Result:** When sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the blue component is removed from the direct beam, leaving a beam that is richer in yellow‑green light.\n\n### 2.2 Human visual system\n\n- **Photoreceptors:** The human eye has three cone types (S, M, L) sensitive to short, medium, and long wavelengths.  \n- **Peak sensitivity:** The M‑cones (medium wavelengths) peak around 530 nm, which is in the green‑yellow part of the spectrum.  \n- **Color perception:** Because the Sun’s spectrum is strongest near 530 nm and because blue light is scattered away, the combined effect is that the Sun is perceived as yellow.\n\n### 2.3 Atmospheric conditions\n\n- **Clear sky:** Sun appears pale yellow or white.  \n- **Dust, pollution, or high humidity:** More scattering → Sun looks more orange or reddish.  \n- **Sunrise/sunset:** Sun’s light passes through a longer atmospheric path, scattering out most blue light and leaving a strong red/orange component.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Color temperature\n\n- **Definition:** A way to describe the hue of a light source in Kelvin (K).  \n- **Sun’s color temperature:** ~5 800 K (often quoted as 5 600 K).  \n- **Interpretation:** 5 800 K is “warm white” – slightly yellowish compared to cooler (blue‑ish) light sources.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n| What you see | Why it happens |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **White** (in space) | Sun emits a full spectrum; no scattering. |\n| **Yellow** (on Earth) | Rayleigh scattering removes blue light; human eye is most sensitive to yellow‑green. |\n| **Orange/red** (sunrise/sunset) | Longer path → more scattering of blue, leaving red/yellow. |\n\nSo, the Sun isn’t actually yellow; it’s a white star whose light is filtered by Earth’s atmosphere and interpreted by our eyes as yellow.",

      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hoofed animals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, and many wildlife species). It is caused by a member of the *Picornaviridae* family, specifically the *Foot‑and‑mouth disease virus* (FMDV), which has seven distinct serotypes (O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, and Asia 1).  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the virus looks like\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Genome** | ~8 kb single‑stranded, positive‑sense RNA |\n| **Structure** | Non‑enveloped, icosahedral capsid (~30 nm) |\n| **Serotypes** | 7 serotypes; each serotype has multiple sub‑types (e.g., O/UK/2001) |\n| **Mutation rate** | High; facilitates rapid evolution and immune evasion |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How it spreads\n\n| Route | Key points |\n|-------|------------|\n| **Direct contact** | Between infected and susceptible animals (e.g., grazing, handling) |\n| **Indirect contact** | Contaminated feed, water, equipment, clothing, and vehicles |\n| **Airborne** | Fine aerosol particles can travel up to 10–20 km in favorable conditions |\n| **Wildlife** | Wild ruminants (e.g., deer, wild boar) can act as reservoirs and spread the virus over long distances |\n| **Human carriers** | Humans can carry the virus on clothing, shoes, or equipment, but are not infected themselves |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Clinical signs\n\n| Species | Typical signs |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs** | Fever (up to 41 °C), lameness, swelling of the feet, vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, lips, and inside the mouth, decreased appetite, weight loss |\n| **Wild ruminants** | Similar lesions; often subclinical or mild |\n| **Pigs** | Vesicles on snout, ears, and teats; high mortality in piglets |\n\n*Vesicles rupture, forming painful ulcers that can lead to secondary bacterial infections.*\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Why it matters\n\n| Impact | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Economic** | Losses from reduced milk and meat production, trade restrictions, culling, and vaccination costs |\n| **Trade** | Most countries impose strict import bans on FMD‑free animals and products from affected regions |\n| **Public health** | No evidence that FMDV infects humans; it is not a zoonotic disease |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Diagnosis\n\n| Method | What it detects |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **Virus isolation** | Cell culture (e.g., BHK‑21 cells) |\n| **RT‑PCR** | Detects viral RNA; highly sensitive |\n| **Serology** | ELISA for antibodies (e.g., NSP ELISA to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) |\n| **Virus neutralization test** | Determines serotype and sub‑type |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Prevention & Control\n\n| Strategy | Key actions |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Inactivated (killed) vaccines; must be matched to circulating serotype; booster schedules vary by region |\n| **Movement restrictions** | Quarantine, controlled animal movement, and stamping‑out (culling) of infected herds |\n| **Biosecurity** | Clean and disinfect equipment, restrict visitor access, use dedicated clothing and footwear |\n| **Surveillance** | Routine testing of high‑risk herds, sentinel animals, and wildlife monitoring |\n| **International cooperation** | FAO, OIE, and national veterinary services coordinate outbreak responses |\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Recent outbreaks (selected)\n\n| Year | Country | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| 2001 | United Kingdom | 6,000+ farms affected; ~600,000 animals culled; major economic impact |\n| 2010 | China | Massive outbreak; >1 million animals culled; led to trade bans |\n| 2019 | Japan | First outbreak in 30 years; contained within weeks |\n| 2023 | USA (California) | Small outbreak in a single farm; contained by rapid vaccination and culling |\n\n---\n\n## 8.  Key take‑away\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a **highly contagious, economically devastating viral disease** that affects a wide range of cloven‑hoofed animals. While it poses no risk to human health, its control relies on rigorous vaccination, strict biosecurity, and coordinated international surveillance. Early detection and rapid response are essential to prevent widespread outbreaks and trade disruptions.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects or features in a medium—most commonly water. By emitting acoustic pulses and listening for their echoes, sonar systems can determine distance, shape, speed, and sometimes composition of submerged objects.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission** – A transducer emits a burst of sound (the “ping”).\n2. **Propagation** – The sound travels through the medium (water, ice, etc.).\n3. **Reflection** – The wave bounces off objects or the seafloor.\n4. **Reception** – The transducer receives the echo.\n5. **Processing** – The time delay and frequency shift of the echo are analyzed to calculate distance, speed, and other characteristics.\n\n### Key Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | Description | Typical Use |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Submarine navigation, fish-finding, depth sounding. |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., engines, marine life). | Anti‑submarine warfare, marine biology studies. |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to create detailed images of the seafloor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys. |\n| **Multibeam Echo Sounder** | Emits multiple beams to map bathymetry over a wide area. | Hydrographic charting, offshore construction. |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | High‑frequency, high‑resolution sonar that produces “pictures” of objects. | Underwater robotics, inspection of pipelines. |\n\n### Common Applications\n\n- **Naval & Military**: Detecting submarines, mines, and surface vessels; navigation and obstacle avoidance.\n- **Commercial Shipping**: Depth sounding, navigation safety, iceberg detection.\n- **Fishing Industry**: Fish‑finding, estimating fish biomass.\n- **Scientific Research**: Mapping ocean floors, studying marine life, monitoring ice thickness.\n- **Underwater Robotics**: Guidance, obstacle avoidance, mapping.\n\n### Basic Principles\n\n- **Speed of Sound**: In seawater, ~1,500 m/s (varies with temperature, salinity, depth).  \n- **Time‑of‑Flight**: Distance = (speed × time) / 2 (divide by 2 because the sound travels to the target and back).  \n- **Doppler Effect**: Frequency shift of the echo indicates relative motion between sonar and target.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- **Attenuation**: Sound weakens with distance; high frequencies attenuate faster.  \n- **Ambient Noise**: Marine life, shipping, weather can mask echoes.  \n- **Resolution vs. Range**: Higher resolution requires higher frequency, which limits range.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** Sonar is an acoustic “radar” that lets us “see” underwater by sending sound waves and interpreting the echoes that bounce back. It’s indispensable for navigation, exploration, and many underwater operations.",

Core Features\n\n| Feature | Typical Presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Pain** | Widespread, aching or burning pain lasting ≥3 months, affecting both sides of the body and above & below the waist. |\n| **Fatigue** | Persistent, non‑refreshing tiredness that can be worse after physical or mental exertion. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Non‑restorative sleep, frequent awakenings, or difficulty falling asleep. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Trouble concentrating, memory lapses, and difficulty with executive tasks. |\n| **Mood changes** | Higher rates of anxiety, depression, and irritability. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches (often migraines), irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, and sensitivity to light, sound, or temperature. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Diagnosis\n\nBecause there is no single laboratory test, diagnosis is largely clinical:\n\n1. **History & Physical Exam** – Look for pain in at least 11 of 18 tender points (though tender‑point testing is no longer required in the 2010 ACR criteria).\n2. **Symptom Criteria** – Pain in all four quadrants of the body for ≥3 months, plus fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and at least one other symptom (e.g., cognitive issues, headaches, IBS).\n3. **Rule Out Other Conditions** – Blood tests (CBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid panel) to exclude infections, autoimmune diseases, or metabolic disorders.\n4. **Screening Tools** – Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Widespread Pain Index (WPI), and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) help quantify severity.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Pathophysiology (What We Know)\n\n- **Central Sensitization**: The central nervous system (brain & spinal cord) becomes hyper‑responsive, amplifying pain signals.\n- **Neurotransmitter Imbalance**: Low levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine can contribute to pain, fatigue, and mood disturbances.\n- **Genetic & Environmental Triggers**: Family history, stress, infections, or physical trauma can precipitate the syndrome.\n- **Sleep & Autonomic Dysregulation**: Poor sleep and dysautonomia (e.g., orthostatic intolerance) can worsen symptoms.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Management\n\n| Modality | What It Does | Typical Approach |\n|----------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Pharmacologic** | Reduces pain, improves sleep, and addresses mood | - **Pain**: duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, gabapentin, tramadol.<br>- **Sleep**: low‑dose trazodone, doxepin, or melatonin.<br>- **Mood**: SSRIs/SNRIs, CBT‑based meds. |\n| **Non‑Pharmacologic** | Addresses lifestyle, stress, and physical conditioning | - **Exercise**: low‑impact aerobic (walking, swimming), stretching, and strength training.<br>- **Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: improves coping, reduces catastrophizing.<br>- **Mindfulness & Relaxation**: meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga.<br>- **Sleep Hygiene**: consistent bedtime, limiting caffeine/alcohol, creating a dark, cool environment. |\n| **Complementary** | Supplements or alternative therapies | - **Acupuncture**: mixed evidence, may help some patients.<br>- **Massage & Physical Therapy**: can reduce pain and improve function.<br>- **Supplements**: magnesium, vitamin D, omega‑3 fatty acids (consult a provider). |\n| **Supportive** | Education & self‑management | - **Patient education**: understanding the disease, setting realistic goals.<br>- **Support groups**: peer support, online communities. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prognosis\n\n- **Chronic**: Symptoms often persist for years, but many patients experience periods of remission or reduced severity.\n- **Impact**: Can affect work, relationships, and overall quality of life.\n- **Individualized Care**: Treatment plans are tailored; what works for one person may not work for another.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Take‑aways\n\n- Fibromyalgia is a **multisystem disorder** with pain, fatigue, sleep, and cognitive symptoms.\n- Diagnosis is **clinical**; no definitive lab test exists.\n- Management is **multimodal**: medication, exercise, CBT, sleep hygiene, and lifestyle changes.\n- Early, comprehensive treatment can improve function and reduce disability.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n| Symptom | Common Treatments |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| Pain | SNRIs, gabapentinoids, tramadol, CBT |\n| Fatigue | Sleep hygiene, low‑dose trazodone, exercise |\n| Sleep | Melatonin, doxepin, CBT‑i |\n| Cognitive fog | CBT, mindfulness, adequate rest |\n| Mood | SSRIs/SNRIs, psychotherapy |\n\nIf you suspect you have fibromyalgia or are experiencing these symptoms, it’s best to consult a rheumatologist or primary‑care provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.",

      "question": "How fast is sound ?",
      "system_answer": "**Speed of sound** is the speed at which a pressure disturbance (a sound wave) travels through a medium. It varies with the medium’s density, elasticity, and temperature. Here are the most common values:\n\n| Medium | Speed (≈ at standard conditions) | Notes |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| **Air (dry, 20 °C, 1 atm)** | **≈ 343 m s⁻¹** (≈ 1 125 ft s⁻¹) | Increases ~0.6 m s⁻¹ per °C rise in temperature. |\n| **Air (0 °C)** | ≈ 331 m s⁻¹ | |\n| **Air (100 °C)** | ≈ 366 m s⁻¹ | |\n| **Water (20 °C)** | **≈ 1 482 m s⁻¹** | Roughly 4.3× faster than in air. |\n| **Sea‑water (15 °C, 1 atm, 3 % salinity)** | ≈ 1 497 m s⁻¹ | Slightly higher due to salinity. |\n| **Steel (room temperature)** | **≈ 5 960 m s⁻¹** | Roughly 17× faster than in air. |\n| **Diamond** | ≈ 12 000 m s⁻¹ | Highest among common solids. |\n\n### Why it changes\n- **Temperature**: In gases, sound speed ≈ √(γ R T) (γ = heat‑capacity ratio, R = specific gas constant, T = absolute temperature).  \n- **Density & Elasticity**: In solids and liquids, speed ≈ √(E/ρ) (E = Young’s modulus or bulk modulus, ρ = density).  \n- **Humidity & Pressure**: Minor effects in air; humidity slightly increases speed, while pressure has negligible effect at normal conditions.\n\n### Quick reference\n- **Air**: ~343 m s⁻¹ (≈ 767 mph) at 20 °C.  \n- **Water**: ~1 482 m s⁻¹ (≈ 3 300 mph).  \n- **Steel**: ~5 960 m s⁻¹ (≈ 13 300 mph).\n\nFeel free to ask if you need the speed for a specific temperature, altitude, or other medium!",

      "question": "What does cc in engines mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**CC in engines = “cubic centimeters.”**  \nIt’s a unit of *engine displacement*—the total volume of all the cylinders in an engine, measured in cubic centimeters (cc).  \n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| What it tells you | Why it matters |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Engine size** – A 1,600 cc engine is roughly 1.6 L. | Larger displacement usually means more power and torque (though efficiency, design, and tuning also matter). |\n| **Fuel consumption** – Bigger engines often burn more fuel per hour. | Helps estimate fuel economy and emissions. |\n| **Regulatory classification** – Many countries use cc to set tax brackets, licensing rules, and insurance rates. | E.g., a motorcycle over 125 cc may require a higher license class. |\n| **Performance comparison** – Allows quick comparison between engines of different brands or models. | A 2,000 cc V‑4 vs. a 2,000 cc inline‑4 will have similar displacement but different characteristics. |\n\n---\n\n### How it’s calculated\n\n1. **Cylinder volume** = π × (bore/2)² × stroke  \n   - *Bore* = cylinder diameter  \n   - *Stroke* = distance the piston travels  \n2. **Total displacement** = cylinder volume × number of cylinders  \n3. Convert cubic centimeters to liters by dividing by 1,000 (1 L = 1,000 cc).\n\n---\n\n### Common examples\n\n| Engine | Approx. cc | Approx. L | Typical use |\n|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|\n| 125 cc motorcycle | 125 cc | 0.125 L | Entry‑level bikes |\n| 600 cc motorcycle | 600 cc | 0.6 L | Sport bikes, touring |\n| 1,600 cc car engine | 1,600 cc | 1.6 L | Compact cars, hybrids |\n| 3,000 cc V‑6 | 3,000 cc | 3.0 L | Mid‑size sedans, SUVs |\n| 5,000 cc V‑8 | 5,000 cc | 5.0 L | Performance cars, trucks |\n\n---\n\n### Quick conversion cheat sheet\n\n| cc | Liters | Approx. horsepower (typical) |\n|----|--------|------------------------------|\n| 125 | 0.125 | 10–15 hp (bike) |\n| 250 | 0.25 | 20–30 hp (bike) |\n| 600 | 0.6 | 80–120 hp (bike) |\n| 1,600 | 1.6 | 100–140 hp (car) |\n| 2,000 | 2.0 | 140–180 hp (car) |\n| 3,000 | 3.0 | 180–250 hp (car) |\n| 4,000 | 4.0 | 250–350 hp (truck) |\n| 5,000 | 5.0 | 350–450 hp (performance) |\n\n*(Horsepower figures are rough averages; actual output depends on design, tuning, and technology.)*\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nWhen you see “cc” next to an engine spec, think of it as the engine’s *volume* in cubic centimeters. It’s the primary way manufacturers and regulators describe how big an engine is and gives you a quick sense of its potential power, fuel use, and legal classification.",

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": "**An ulcer is a localized area of tissue damage that breaks through the protective lining of an organ, forming an open sore.**  \nThe most common types are *peptic ulcers* (stomach or duodenum) and *pressure (decubitus) ulcers* (skin and underlying tissue). Below is a quick‑reference guide covering the basics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Peptic Ulcers (Stomach & Duodenal)\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Definition** | A mucosal defect that extends through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa or deeper layers of the stomach or duodenum. |\n| **Causes** | • *Helicobacter pylori* infection (≈70 % of cases) <br>• Chronic NSAID or aspirin use <br>• Excess gastric acid (e.g., Zollinger‑Ellison syndrome) <br>• Stress‑related (rare) |\n| **Risk Factors** | • Smoking, alcohol, spicy foods (symptom triggers, not causes) <br>• Family history <br>• Age > 50 <br>• Male sex |\n| **Symptoms** | • Burning epigastric pain (often 2–3 h after meals) <br>• Pain relieved or worsened by food/acid <br>• Nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety <br>• Rarely, hematemesis or melena (bleeding) |\n| **Diagnosis** | • Upper endoscopy (gold standard) <br>• Rapid urease test, stool antigen, or blood antibody for H. pylori <br>• Barium swallow (if endoscopy unavailable) |\n| **Treatment** | • **Eradicate H. pylori**: 7–14 days of triple or quadruple therapy (PPI + two antibiotics). <br>• **Reduce acid**: Proton‑pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole) or H₂ blockers. <br>• **Stop NSAIDs** or switch to safer alternatives. <br>• Lifestyle: avoid alcohol, smoking, NSAIDs, and spicy foods. |\n| **Complications** | • Bleeding, perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, gastric cancer (rare). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pressure (Decubitus) Ulcers\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Definition** | Localized injury to skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure, friction, or shear. |\n| **Stages** | I (non‑blanchable erythema) → II (partial‑thickness skin loss) → III (full‑thickness skin loss) → IV (full‑thickness tissue loss). |\n| **Risk Factors** | • Immobility (bedridden, wheelchair users) <br>• Incontinence (moisture) <br>• Poor nutrition <br>• Age, comorbidities (diabetes, vascular disease) |\n| **Symptoms** | • Redness that does not fade with pressure <br>• Pain, tenderness, or loss of sensation <br>• Skin breakdown, ulceration, drainage |\n| **Prevention/Treatment** | • Regular repositioning (every 2 h) <br>• Pressure‑relieving devices (special mattresses, cushions) <br>• Skin hygiene, moisture control <br>• Nutritional support (protein, calories, vitamins) <br>• Wound care (cleaning, dressings, debridement) <br>• Treat underlying conditions (diabetes control, infection). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Other Common Ulcers\n\n| Organ | Typical Ulcer | Key Points |\n|-------|---------------|------------|\n| **Esophagus** | *Barrett’s esophagus* (metaplastic change) | Risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma; diagnosed by endoscopy with biopsy. |\n| **Skin** | *Acne vulgaris* (comedones, pustules) | Inflammatory lesions; treat with topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics. |\n| **Mouth** | *Canker sores* (aphthous ulcers) | Painful, shallow lesions; often idiopathic; treat with topical steroids or lidocaine. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Quick Take‑away\n\n- **Ulcer = a break in tissue** that can occur anywhere in the body.  \n- **Peptic ulcers** are the most common medical ulcers, caused mainly by H. pylori or NSAIDs.  \n- **Pressure ulcers** are a major concern in long‑term care and require preventive measures.  \n- **Diagnosis** relies on imaging (endoscopy, X‑ray) and laboratory tests.  \n- **Treatment** focuses on eliminating the cause (antibiotics, acid suppression, repositioning) and supporting healing (nutrition, wound care).  \n\nIf you suspect an ulcer—especially if you have persistent pain, bleeding, or skin breakdown—seek medical evaluation promptly. Early treatment reduces complications and improves outcomes.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest you earn on both the original amount of money you invest (the principal) and on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” because it is added to the principal and then earns interest itself in subsequent periods.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Principal (P)** – the initial amount of money.\n2. **Rate (r)** – the interest rate per compounding period (expressed as a decimal).\n3. **Number of compounding periods (n)** – how many times interest is added in a given time span.\n4. **Time (t)** – the total number of years (or other time unit) the money is invested.\n\nThe future value (FV) after \\(t\\) years is calculated with:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{FV = P \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n t}}\n\\]\n\n- If interest is compounded **annually**, \\(n = 1\\).\n- If compounded **semi‑annually**, \\(n = 2\\).\n- If compounded **monthly**, \\(n = 12\\), etc.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you invest \\$1,000 at an annual interest rate of 6 % compounded monthly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = \\$1{,}000\\)\n- \\(r = 0.06\\)\n- \\(n = 12\\)\n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nFV = 1{,}000 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n   = 1{,}000 \\times (1.005)^{36}\n   \\approx \\$1{,}194.05\n\\]\n\nSo you would have about \\$1,194 after 3 years, earning roughly \\$194 in interest.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Higher compounding frequency** → more interest earned (e.g., monthly vs. annually).\n- **Longer time horizon** → compounding has a bigger effect.\n- **Higher rates** → faster growth.\n\nCompound interest is the engine behind many savings accounts, retirement plans, and investment vehicles, turning small deposits into substantial wealth over time.",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "### Hybridization – The Chemistry View\n\n**Hybridization** is the quantum‑mechanical mixing of atomic orbitals (s, p, d, …) on a single atom to form new, equivalent “hybrid” orbitals that are better suited for bonding with other atoms. It explains the shapes of molecules, bond angles, and the nature of chemical bonds.\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals Combined | Number of Hybrid Orbitals | Typical Geometry | Common Example |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | 2 | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | 3 | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, ethene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | 4 | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃, H₂O (with lone pairs) |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | 6 | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n#### Why Hybridization Matters\n\n1. **Predicts Bond Angles** – The geometry of the hybrid orbitals dictates the angles between bonds (e.g., 109.5° for tetrahedral sp³).\n2. **Explains Bond Strength** – Hybrid orbitals that are more s‑character (sp, sp²) are closer to the nucleus, making bonds shorter and stronger.\n3. **Accounts for Lone Pairs** – Lone pairs occupy hybrid orbitals, influencing molecular shape (e.g., H₂O’s bent shape due to two lone pairs on oxygen).\n\n#### How It Works (Simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the Atom’s Valence Orbitals** – e.g., carbon has one 2s and three 2p orbitals.\n2. **Determine the Number of Bonds + Lone Pairs** – For CH₄, carbon forms four σ bonds → needs four hybrid orbitals.\n3. **Mix Orbitals** – Combine the 2s and 2p orbitals to produce four equivalent sp³ hybrids.\n4. **Form Bonds** – Each hybrid overlaps with a partner’s orbital (usually an s or p) to create a σ bond.\n\n---\n\n### Other Contexts of “Hybridization”\n\n| Field | What It Means | Example |\n|-------|---------------|---------|\n| **Biology / Genetics** | Crossing of two different species or varieties to produce a hybrid organism. | Wheat × rye → triticale |\n| **Ecology** | Interbreeding between two distinct populations or species, often leading to gene flow. | Hybrid zones in salamanders |\n| **Technology** | Combining two different systems or technologies. | Hybrid cars (combining gasoline engine + electric motor) |\n| **Data Science** | Ensemble methods that blend predictions from multiple models. | Gradient boosting + random forest → hybrid model |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\n- **Chemistry**: Hybridization explains how atoms form bonds with specific shapes and strengths by mixing their orbitals.\n- **Other fields**: The term generally means “mixing two distinct entities to create something new.”\n\nIf you’re curious about a particular type of hybridization (e.g., in genetics or technology), just let me know!",

      "question": "What are pediatricians ?",
      "system_answer": "**Pediatricians** are medical doctors who specialize in the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents—from birth through the teenage years (typically up to age 18–21, depending on the country). Their primary focus is on the unique medical, developmental, and emotional needs of younger patients.\n\n---\n\n### Core Roles & Responsibilities\n\n| Area | What Pediatricians Do |\n|------|-----------------------|\n| **Preventive Care** | Administer routine vaccinations, conduct growth and developmental screenings, give nutrition and safety advice. |\n| **Diagnosis & Treatment** | Identify and manage acute illnesses (e.g., infections, asthma), chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, epilepsy), and injuries. |\n| **Developmental & Behavioral Health** | Monitor milestones, screen for developmental delays, provide guidance on behavior, mental health, and family dynamics. |\n| **Health Education** | Teach parents and children about healthy habits, disease prevention, and when to seek care. |\n| **Coordination of Care** | Refer to specialists (e.g., pediatric cardiology, neurology) and coordinate with schools, therapists, and other caregivers. |\n| **Emergency Care** | Handle urgent situations such as severe allergic reactions, asthma attacks, or trauma. |\n\n---\n\n### Training Path\n\n1. **Undergraduate Degree** (4 years) – often in biology, chemistry, or a related field.  \n2. **Medical School** (4 years) – earns an MD or DO degree.  \n3. **Pediatrics Residency** (3 years) – intensive training in hospitals and outpatient settings, covering general pediatrics.  \n4. **Board Certification** – passing exams from the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) or equivalent bodies worldwide.  \n5. **Optional Subspecialty Fellowship** (1–3 years) – for focused fields such as pediatric oncology, neonatology, or pediatric cardiology.\n\n---\n\n### How Pediatricians Differ from Other Primary Care Providers\n\n| Feature | Pediatrician | Family Physician / General Practitioner |\n|---------|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Patient Age Range** | 0–18/21 yrs | 0–90+ yrs |\n| **Training Focus** | Child‑specific physiology, growth, developmental psychology | Broad adult and child care |\n| **Specialized Equipment** | Pediatric‑sized instruments, growth charts | Standard adult equipment |\n| **Common Conditions** | Childhood infections, developmental disorders, pediatric allergies | Broad spectrum of adult and child conditions |\n\n---\n\n### Settings Where Pediatricians Work\n\n- **Private Practice** – solo or group clinics.  \n- **Hospital** – inpatient pediatric wards, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).  \n- **Community Health Centers** – serving underserved populations.  \n- **Academic/Teaching Hospitals** – training residents and fellows.  \n- **School or School‑Based Clinics** – providing on‑site care.  \n- **Telemedicine** – virtual visits, especially for follow‑ups or triage.\n\n---\n\n### Why Pediatric Care Matters\n\n- **Early Intervention**: Detecting developmental delays or health issues early can dramatically improve outcomes.  \n- **Vaccination & Prevention**: Pediatricians drive immunization programs that protect children and the broader community.  \n- **Family Support**: They often serve as a central resource for parents navigating health, nutrition, and safety questions.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Takeaway\n\nA pediatrician is a doctor who has specialized training to care for children’s unique medical and developmental needs, from routine check‑ups and vaccinations to diagnosing and treating complex illnesses. They play a pivotal role in ensuring children grow healthy, safe, and well‑supported.",

By modeling these velocities, geophysicists infer temperature profiles.\n- **Laboratory experiments**: High‑pressure, high‑temperature experiments on iron alloys replicate core conditions to determine melting curves.\n- **Thermal models**: Numerical simulations of heat transport (conduction, convection, and advection) in the mantle and core, constrained by surface heat flow and seismic data, yield temperature estimates.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe very center of the Earth—the solid inner core—is estimated to be **about 5,500 – 6,000 °C**. This extreme temperature, combined with the enormous pressure, keeps the core in a solid state despite the heat, while the surrounding liquid outer core remains molten.",

      "question": "What is severance pay ?",
      "system_answer": "**Severance pay** is a financial benefit that an employer may provide to an employee when the employment relationship is terminated—usually through layoffs, downsizing, or mutual agreement. It is not a legal requirement in most places (except for specific circumstances such as mass layoffs under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act in the U.S.), but many companies offer it as a goodwill gesture, to help with transition, or to mitigate potential legal claims.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Elements\n\n| Element | What it is | Typical Features |\n|---------|------------|------------------|\n| **Payment amount** | A lump‑sum or periodic cash payment. | Often a multiple of the employee’s base salary (e.g., 1–3 months’ pay). |\n| **Eligibility** | Usually based on tenure, position, or the reason for termination. | Employees with ≥ 1 year of service, senior roles, or those laid off in a restructuring. |\n| **Duration** | The period over which the payment is made. | One‑time lump sum, or a series of monthly payments (e.g., 3–6 months). |\n| **Conditions** | Requirements the employee must meet to receive the payment. | Signing a release of claims, agreeing not to compete, or staying out of the company for a specified period. |\n| **Tax treatment** | How the payment is taxed. | Generally treated as ordinary income; may be subject to withholding and unemployment taxes. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Employers Offer Severance\n\n| Reason | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Legal protection** | Reduces the risk of wrongful‑termination lawsuits or claims of discrimination. |\n| **Reputation** | Demonstrates goodwill, helping maintain a positive employer brand. |\n| **Employee morale** | Provides a smoother transition for remaining staff, reducing anxiety. |\n| **Retention of talent** | Encourages employees to stay until the end of their notice period or to complete transition tasks. |\n| **Compliance** | Meets statutory requirements in certain jurisdictions (e.g., U.S. WARN Act, EU’s “Severance Pay Directive” for large layoffs). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common Components of a Severance Package\n\n| Component | Typical Content |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Severance payment** | Base salary × X months, sometimes plus a bonus or unused vacation payout. |\n| **Health benefits** | Continuation of health insurance (often COBRA in the U.S.) for a limited time. |\n| **Outplacement services** | Career counseling, résumé workshops, job‑search assistance. |\n| **Reference letter** | Written confirmation of employment dates and performance. |\n| **Non‑compete/Non‑disparagement** | Clauses that restrict the employee from working for competitors or making negative statements. |\n| **Release of claims** | A signed document waiving the employee’s right to sue the employer for the termination. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Legal Landscape (U.S. Focus)\n\n| Law | Who it applies to | Key Provisions |\n|-----|-------------------|----------------|\n| **WARN Act** | Employers with ≥ 100 employees | Must give 60‑day notice for mass layoffs or plant closures; may provide severance to mitigate hardship. |\n| **FLSA** | All employees | Severance is not required, but if offered, it must be paid in a single lump sum or in installments that are not considered wages for overtime purposes. |\n| **State laws** | Varies by state | Some states (e.g., California, New York) have specific rules about severance and notice periods. |\n| **Employment contracts** | Contractual agreements | Severance terms may be stipulated in the contract or collective bargaining agreement. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. International Variations\n\n| Region | Typical Severance Practices |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| **European Union** | Many countries require statutory severance based on years of service (e.g., 1–2 weeks’ pay per year). |\n| **Canada** | Provincial employment standards set minimum severance; employers often offer more generous packages. |\n| **Australia** | Minimum notice or pay in lieu of notice; severance is usually part of the termination package. |\n| **Asia** | Practices vary widely; some countries have statutory severance, others rely on company policy. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. How to Negotiate Severance\n\n1. **Review your contract or employee handbook** – Look for any severance clauses.  \n2. **Ask for a written offer** – Ensure all terms are documented.  \n3. **Consider the total package** – Pay, benefits, outplacement, and any non‑compete clauses.  \n4. **Seek legal advice** – Especially if a release of claims is required.  \n5. **Negotiate** – You can ask for a higher multiple of salary, extended benefits, or a longer notice period.  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick Takeaway\n\n- **Severance pay** is a voluntary or sometimes statutory payment to employees when they are let go.  \n- It usually includes a cash component, benefits continuation, and sometimes outplacement services.  \n- The amount and conditions vary by company, industry, and jurisdiction.  \n- It serves both practical (financial support) and strategic (legal protection, reputation) purposes for employers.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need details for a specific country, industry, or negotiation strategy!",

How Mold Grows\n\n| Step | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **1. Spores land** | Mold spores are airborne and can settle on any surface. |\n| **2. Moisture & nutrients** | They need water (humidity > 60 %) and a food source (cellulose, starch, etc.). |\n| **3. Germination** | Spores germinate into hyphae (thread‑like filaments). |\n| **4. Colonization** | Hyphae spread, forming a mycelium network that can cover large areas. |\n| **5. Spore production** | Mature colonies produce new spores, which disperse to start the cycle again. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Types of Mold\n\n| Mold | Typical Color | Where It’s Found | Health Notes |\n|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Aspergillus** | Green, yellow, black | Damp walls, HVAC ducts | Can cause allergic reactions; some species produce mycotoxins. |\n| **Cladosporium** | Dark green, black | Indoor surfaces, outdoor wood | Often triggers asthma or allergic rhinitis. |\n| **Stachybotrys chartarum** (Black mold) | Dark green/black | Water‑damaged wood, drywall | Produces potent mycotoxins; linked to severe respiratory issues. |\n| **Penicillium** | Blue, green, white | Food, damp fabrics | Generally less harmful but can cause allergies. |\n| **Alternaria** | Dark green, black | Indoor/outdoor surfaces | Common allergen; can worsen asthma. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why Mold Matters\n\n| Issue | Impact |\n|-------|--------|\n| **Health** | Allergies, asthma, sinusitis, skin irritation, respiratory distress; some molds produce toxic mycotoxins. |\n| **Structural** | Degrades building materials (wood, drywall, insulation), leading to costly repairs. |\n| **Economic** | Damage to property, loss of belongings, increased insurance premiums. |\n| **Environmental** | Mold growth can release spores into the air, affecting indoor air quality. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prevention & Control\n\n| Strategy | How it Works |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Control moisture** | Fix leaks, use dehumidifiers (target < 50 % RH), ensure proper ventilation (fans, exhaust). |\n| **Temperature management** | Keep indoor temps below 20 °C (68 °F) in damp areas; avoid condensation on windows. |\n| **Regular inspections** | Check basements, crawl spaces, bathrooms, and HVAC systems for early signs. |\n| **Clean & dry** | Wipe down damp surfaces within 24 h; use mold‑removing cleaners (bleach, vinegar, commercial products). |\n| **Use mold‑resistant materials** | Mold‑resistant drywall, paints, and insulation in high‑risk areas. |\n| **Professional remediation** | For large infestations (> 10 sq ft) or when health concerns arise; involves containment, removal, and decontamination. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can I just scrub mold off?** | Light surface mold can often be cleaned with detergent or bleach, but deeper or extensive growth may require professional removal. |\n| **Is mold always black?** | No. Mold comes in many colors; “black mold” is a common name for *Stachybotrys chartarum*, but other molds can also be dark. |\n| **Do all molds produce toxins?** | Only certain species produce harmful mycotoxins. However, any mold can trigger allergic reactions. |\n| **Can mold grow on food?** | Yes—especially on bread, fruit, and dairy. It’s a sign the food is spoiled. |\n| **How long does mold stay after removal?** | If moisture is still present, mold can re‑appear quickly. Ensure the environment is dry and ventilated. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nMold is a natural, spore‑producing fungus that thrives in damp, warm environments. While it plays a useful ecological role in breaking down organic matter, indoor mold growth can pose health risks and damage property. Keeping indoor humidity low, fixing leaks promptly, and cleaning up spills quickly are the best defenses against mold. If you suspect a significant infestation, consider a professional assessment to ensure safe and thorough remediation.",

      "system_answer": "**Sitting Shiva** is a traditional Jewish mourning practice that takes place after the death of a close relative (usually a parent, spouse, child, sibling, or grandparent). The term comes from the Hebrew word *שִׁבְעָה* (*shivah*), meaning “seven,” because the mourning period traditionally lasts for seven days.\n\n### What it involves\n\n| Aspect | Typical Practice |\n|--------|------------------|\n| **Timeframe** | 7 days after the burial (sometimes extended to 11 days for a parent). |\n| **Location** | The home of the mourner or a designated space where the family gathers. |\n| **Physical Setup** | Mourners sit on low stools or cushions, often in a circle or semi‑circle. |\n| **Visitors** | Friends, relatives, and community members come to offer condolences, share memories, and provide support. |\n| **Activities** | • No music or dancing.<br>• No television or loud noises.<br>• No work or business activities.<br>• Meals are simple, often with a focus on comfort foods. |\n| **Prayers** | The *Kaddish* (a prayer for the deceased) is recited daily, usually by a close relative or a rabbi. |\n| **Emotional Expression** | Crying, sharing stories, and openly expressing grief are encouraged. |\n| **End of Shiva** | The final day is marked by a small ceremony or a final prayer, after which the family may resume normal activities. |\n\n### Why it’s done\n\n- **Respect for the deceased**: The period allows the family to honor the life of the person who has passed.\n- **Community support**: By inviting others to sit with them, mourners receive emotional and practical help.\n- **Spiritual reflection**: The practice encourages contemplation of mortality, the cycle of life, and the importance of community.\n\n### Cultural variations\n\n- **Ashkenazi vs. Sephardi**: While the core elements are similar, there can be differences in customs, such as the use of a *shiva* table, the type of food served, or the length of the mourning period.\n- **Modern adaptations**: Some families may shorten the period or incorporate technology (e.g., virtual visits) to accommodate contemporary lifestyles.\n\n### In short\n\nSitting Shiva is a communal, seven‑day period of mourning in Judaism where family and friends gather to honor the deceased, support one another, and observe specific rituals that help the bereaved process their grief.",

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease** (officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE**) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by misfolded proteins called **prions** that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, damaged tissue structure.\n\n### Key points\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Cause** | Abnormal prion proteins (PrP^Sc) that induce normal prion proteins (PrP^C) to misfold. |\n| **Transmission in cattle** | Primarily through contaminated feed containing animal protein (e.g., meat‑and‑bone meal) that carries the prion. |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Loss of coordination, weight loss, abnormal gait, tremors, and eventually death (usually within 6–12 months after onset). |\n| **Human risk** | The disease can cross species as **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**. Humans can contract it by eating infected beef products, especially brain or spinal tissue. |\n| **Diagnosis** | Post‑mortem brain tissue examination (spongiform changes, prion protein accumulation). |\n| **Control measures** | Strict feed‑ban regulations, surveillance of cattle, removal of high‑risk tissues, and culling of infected or exposed animals. |\n| **Historical context** | First identified in the UK in 1986; led to widespread changes in animal feed regulations and food safety policies worldwide. |\n\nMad cow disease is a classic example of a **prion disease**, illustrating how a misfolded protein can act as an infectious agent without any nucleic acid.",

      "system_answer": "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  \nIts composition is not fixed; it varies with the geological source, but the bulk of most natural‑gas supplies worldwide is made up of the following components:\n\n| Component | Typical range in a “clean” natural‑gas stream | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 85 – 95 % | The dominant constituent; the primary energy source. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 3 – 10 % | A heavier hydrocarbon that can be separated for use as a feedstock for petrochemicals. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Often recovered as a by‑product; used for heating and as a petrochemical feed. |\n| **Butane (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.1 – 1 % | Similar to propane; can be blended into gasoline or used as a fuel. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; can dilute the gas and affect heating value. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.1 – 2 % | Non‑combustible; removed in many pipelines to improve calorific value. |\n| **Other trace gases** | < 1 % | Includes hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), water vapor (H₂O), helium, argon, and very small amounts of heavier hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, etc.). |\n\n### Key points\n\n1. **Methane is the energy‑rich core** – it provides about 55–60 MJ per cubic meter of natural gas.\n2. **Heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane)** are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks and can be separated from the gas stream.\n3. **Non‑combustible gases (N₂, CO₂, H₂S, H₂O)** are typically removed or reduced in pipelines to increase heating value and meet safety/quality standards.\n4. **Composition varies by field** – e.g., “sweet” gas (low H₂S) vs. “sour” gas (high H₂S), and “wet” vs. “dry” gas (water‑vapor content).\n\nSo, natural gas is essentially a mixture of methane with varying amounts of other hydrocarbons and non‑combustible gases, the exact mix depending on the source and processing.",
