      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** refers to the range of heartbeats per minute (bpm) that you aim for during aerobic exercise to achieve specific fitness or health goals. It’s usually expressed as a percentage of your maximum heart rate (MHR).  \n\n| Goal | Target % of MHR | Typical bpm range (for a 30‑year‑old with MHR ≈ 190 bpm) |\n|------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Light‑intensity (warm‑up, recovery) | 50–60 % | 95–114 bpm |\n| Moderate‑intensity (fat‑burn, cardio fitness) | 60–70 % | 114–133 bpm |\n| Vigorous‑intensity (endurance, performance) | 70–85 % | 133–162 bpm |\n| Near‑maximal (interval training, high‑intensity) | 85–95 % | 162–181 bpm |\n\n**How to calculate it:**\n\n1. **Estimate your MHR**:  \n   - Common formula: 220 – age.  \n   - For a 30‑year‑old: 220 – 30 = 190 bpm.\n\n2. **Choose your intensity level** (e.g., 70 % for moderate exercise).  \n3. **Multiply** MHR by the chosen percentage:  \n   - 190 × 0.70 = 133 bpm.\n\n4. **Aim to keep your heart rate within that range** during the workout.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Helps you train safely and effectively.  \n- Ensures you’re exercising at the intensity needed for your goals (weight loss, cardiovascular health, endurance).  \n- Prevents overexertion or under‑training.\n\n**Tips for monitoring:**\n\n- Use a heart‑rate monitor (wrist‑based, chest strap, or smartwatch).  \n- Check your pulse manually (beat your wrist or neck for 15 seconds, multiply by 4).  \n- Adjust intensity if you’re consistently above or below the target range.\n\n**When to use it:**  \n- During cardio sessions (running, cycling, swimming).  \n- For structured training plans (e.g., HIIT, tempo runs).  \n- When you want to track progress over time.\n\nIf you have medical conditions or are new to exercise, it’s wise to consult a healthcare professional before starting a new training program.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow (to us on Earth)**  \n\n| Factor | What Happens | Why It Makes the Sun Appear Yellow |\n|--------|--------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Sun’s true color** | The Sun’s surface (photosphere) emits a spectrum that peaks in the green‑yellow part of the visible range. Its effective temperature (~5 800 K) gives it a *white* color when viewed from space. | The Sun itself isn’t yellow; it’s essentially white. |\n| **Earth’s atmosphere** | As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength light (blue, violet) is scattered by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering) and small particles. Longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) travel more directly. | The scattering removes a lot of the blue light from the direct beam that reaches our eyes, leaving a beam that is richer in yellow‑orange wavelengths. |\n| **Viewing angle** | Near the horizon, the light path through the atmosphere is longest, scattering even more blue light and giving the Sun a reddish or orange hue. At noon, the path is shortest, so the Sun looks more yellow‑white. | The amount of scattering depends on the angle, so the Sun’s apparent color changes. |\n| **Human eye response** | Our eyes are more sensitive to green‑yellow light. Even a small excess of yellow‑green wavelengths can dominate the perceived color. | The combination of the Sun’s spectrum and atmospheric filtering makes the Sun look yellow to us. |\n\n**In short:**  \n- The Sun emits nearly white light.  \n- The atmosphere scatters blue light out of the direct beam.  \n- The remaining light that reaches our eyes is richer in yellow‑orange wavelengths, so the Sun appears yellow (or white‑yellow) from the ground.",

      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease (FMD)**  \nA highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many wildlife species). It is caused by the *foot‑and‑mouth disease virus* (FMDV), a member of the *Picornaviridae* family, genus *Aphthovirus*.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Virus & Classification\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Virus type** | Positive‑sense, single‑stranded RNA |\n| **Genus** | Aphthovirus |\n| **Serotypes** | Seven distinct serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, Asia‑1) – each requires its own vaccine. |\n| **Genome** | ~8,500 nucleotides, encoding 4 structural (VP1‑VP4) and 8 non‑structural proteins. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Affected Species\n- **Domestic livestock**: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, buffalo, deer, antelope, etc.  \n- **Wildlife**: many species of deer, antelope, and other cloven‑hooved mammals.  \n- **Humans**: not a disease of humans, but humans can carry the virus on clothing, equipment, or in the environment.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Transmission\n| Mode | How it spreads |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Direct contact** | Between infected and susceptible animals (e.g., through saliva, milk, or contact with lesions). |\n| **Indirect contact** | Contaminated feed, water, equipment, clothing, or vehicles. |\n| **Airborne** | Fine aerosol particles can travel up to several kilometers in favorable conditions. |\n| **Wildlife vectors** | Infected wildlife can spread the virus to domestic herds. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Clinical Signs\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 2–14 days (average 4–7 days). |\n| **Early signs** | Fever, lameness, loss of appetite, salivation. |\n| **Lesions** | Small, fluid‑filled vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, lips, inside the mouth, and on the feet (especially the interdigital spaces). Vesicles rupture → painful ulcers. |\n| **Complications** | Secondary bacterial infections, reduced milk production, reproductive failure, and in some cases death (especially in young animals). |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Economic & Public‑Health Impact\n- **Livestock industry**: massive losses from decreased productivity, trade restrictions, and culling.  \n- **Trade**: Countries with FMD outbreaks face bans on export of meat, dairy, and live animals.  \n- **Human health**: No human disease, but the virus can be transmitted to humans, causing mild flu‑like symptoms or a rash in rare cases.  \n\n---\n\n## 6.  Diagnosis\n- **Clinical observation** (lesions, fever).  \n- **Laboratory tests**:  \n  - Virus isolation (cell culture).  \n  - RT‑PCR (detects viral RNA).  \n  - ELISA (detects antibodies).  \n  - Virus neutralization tests (serotype identification).\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Prevention & Control\n| Strategy | Key Points |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines; must match circulating serotype. |\n| **Movement control** | Quarantine, movement restrictions, and stamping‑out (culling) of infected and exposed animals. |\n| **Biosecurity** | Clean and disinfect equipment, restrict visitor access, use dedicated clothing and footwear. |\n| **Surveillance** | Routine testing of herds, especially in high‑risk areas. |\n| **Wildlife management** | Monitoring and controlling wildlife reservoirs. |\n| **International cooperation** | Reporting to OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) and FAO; participation in global FMD control programs. |\n\n---\n\n## 8.  Treatment\n- **No antiviral therapy** exists.  \n- **Supportive care**: pain relief, antibiotics for secondary infections, fluid therapy, and isolation.  \n- **Culling**: In many countries, infected animals are euthanized to prevent spread.\n\n---\n\n## 9.  Global Status\n- **Endemic**: Many countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and parts of South America.  \n- **Eradicated**: The United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and several European countries have declared FMD free.  \n- **Control programs**: OIE and FAO coordinate vaccination campaigns, surveillance, and rapid response teams.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Take‑away\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a **viral, highly contagious disease of cloven‑hooved animals** that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth. It has **no direct effect on humans** but can cause severe economic losses and trade restrictions worldwide. Control relies on **vaccination, strict biosecurity, and rapid culling** of infected animals.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects, measure distances, or map environments—most commonly underwater.  \n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission** – A sonar system emits a sound pulse (the “ping”) into the medium (water, air, or even solid material).  \n2. **Propagation** – The pulse travels until it encounters an object or boundary.  \n3. **Reflection** – The sound bounces back (echo) toward the source.  \n4. **Reception** – Hydrophones or microphones pick up the echo.  \n5. **Processing** – The time delay and signal characteristics are analyzed to determine distance, size, shape, speed, and sometimes material properties of the target.\n\n### Types of Sonar\n| Type | Description | Typical Use |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Navigation, depth sounding, fish-finding, submarine detection. |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine life, ships). | Stealth detection, marine biology studies. |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Uses high‑frequency sound to create detailed images of underwater structures. | Sonar imaging of the seafloor, pipeline inspection. |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to produce a side‑looking image of the seafloor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys. |\n| **Multibeam Sonar** | Emits multiple beams to map large areas quickly. | Bathymetric mapping, hydrographic surveys. |\n\n### Common Applications\n- **Naval and maritime**: navigation, obstacle avoidance, submarine detection, mine countermeasures.  \n- **Commercial**: fishing (fish finders), offshore construction, pipeline inspection.  \n- **Scientific**: oceanography, marine biology, seafloor mapping.  \n- **Civil**: underwater archaeology, pipeline and cable monitoring.  \n\n### Key Parameters\n- **Frequency**: Low frequencies (≤ 10 kHz) travel farther but give lower resolution; high frequencies (≥ 100 kHz) provide finer detail but attenuate quickly.  \n- **Pulse length**: Short pulses give better range resolution; long pulses increase energy and detection range.  \n- **Beamwidth**: Narrow beams give higher angular resolution; wide beams cover larger areas.  \n\n### Limitations\n- **Attenuation**: Sound loses energy with distance, especially at high frequencies.  \n- **Ambient noise**: Marine life, shipping, and weather can mask echoes.  \n- **Multipath**: Reflections from multiple surfaces can create confusing echoes.  \n\n---\n\n**Other “Sonar” references**  \n- **SonarQube**: A popular open‑source platform for continuous inspection of code quality.  \n- **Sonar (software)**: Various tools and libraries that analyze or visualize sonar data.  \n\nIf you had a different context in mind (e.g., software, a specific product), let me know and I can dive deeper!",

The pain is usually “widespread” – affecting both sides of the body and above and below the waist. |\n| **Other common symptoms** | • Excessive fatigue<br>• Sleep disturbances (often non‑restorative sleep, insomnia, or “sleeping on the wrong side”)<br>• “Fibro fog” – problems with concentration, memory, and mental clarity<br>• Headaches or migraines<br>• Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other gastrointestinal issues<br>• Mood changes (depression, anxiety)<br>• Sensory sensitivities (light, sound, temperature) |\n| **Tender points** | Historically, 18 specific tender points were used for diagnosis, but modern criteria focus more on widespread pain and symptom severity rather than pinpointing tender spots. |\n| **Causes** | The exact cause is unknown. Current theories suggest a combination of: <br>• Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) “over‑reactivity” to pain signals (central sensitization).<br>• Genetic predisposition.<br>• Trigger events such as physical injury, infection, or significant stress. |\n| **Diagnosis** | • Clinical evaluation: history of widespread pain lasting >3 months, plus at least 11 of 19 specific symptoms (fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive issues, etc.).<br>• Exclusion of other conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease).<br>• No single lab test confirms fibromyalgia; labs are used mainly to rule out other causes. |\n| **Treatment** | *Multimodal approach* – no single cure, but many strategies help: <br>• Medications: pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), antidepressants (duloxetine, milnacipran), anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin).<br>• Physical therapy & graded exercise (walking, swimming, low‑impact activities).<br>• Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage pain perception and coping strategies.<br>• Lifestyle changes: regular sleep schedule, stress‑reduction techniques (yoga, meditation), balanced diet.<br>• Complementary therapies: acupuncture, massage, heat/cold therapy. |\n| **Prognosis** | Fibromyalgia is a lifelong condition, but symptoms can fluctuate. With proper management, many people experience significant relief and can lead active, productive lives. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Fibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition centered on widespread pain and fatigue, driven by abnormal pain processing in the nervous system.

      "question": "What is plastic made of ?",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nPlastic is a *polymer*—a long chain of repeating molecular units (monomers) that are chemically bonded together. Most plastics are made from petrochemical feedstocks (oil or natural gas), but some are now produced from renewable sources such as corn starch or sugarcane.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What a polymer is\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **Monomer** | The basic building block (e.g., ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride). |\n| **Polymer** | A chain of many monomers linked by covalent bonds. |\n| **Polymerization** | The chemical reaction that joins monomers into a polymer (addition or condensation). |\n| **Additives** | Substances (plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, fillers) mixed in to give the plastic desired properties. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical petrochemical‑derived plastics\n\n| Plastic | Common monomer(s) | Key properties | Typical uses |\n|---------|------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Polyethylene (PE)** | Ethylene | Flexible, low moisture absorption | Bags, bottles, pipes |\n| **Polypropylene (PP)** | Propylene | Heat‑resistant, chemical‑resistant | Food containers, automotive parts |\n| **Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)** | Vinyl chloride | Rigid, durable | Pipes, siding, vinyl flooring |\n| **Polystyrene (PS)** | Styrene | Rigid, insulating | Foam cups, insulation |\n| **Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)** | Terephthalic acid + ethylene glycol | Strong, clear | Beverage bottles, fibers |\n| **Polycarbonate (PC)** | Bisphenol‑A + phosgene | Impact‑resistant, transparent | Eyeglass lenses, safety glasses |\n| **Acrylic (PMMA)** | Methyl methacrylate | Transparent, weather‑resistant | Signage, skylights |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Renewable‑source plastics\n\n| Plastic | Feedstock | Example |\n|---------|-----------|---------|\n| **Polylactic acid (PLA)** | Lactic acid from fermented corn or sugarcane | Biodegradable packaging |\n| **Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)** | Microbial fermentation of sugars | Biodegradable mulch film |\n| **Polybutylene succinate (PBS)** | Succinic acid + 1,4‑butanediol (from biomass) | Compostable bags |\n\nThese are still polymers; the difference is that the monomers come from renewable resources rather than fossil fuels.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How plastic is made (simplified process)\n\n1. **Feedstock extraction** – crude oil or natural gas is refined to produce monomers (e.g., ethylene, propylene).  \n2. **Polymerization** – monomers are reacted in a reactor (often with a catalyst) to form long polymer chains.  \n3. **Molding or extrusion** – the molten polymer is shaped into pellets, films, or other forms.  \n4. **Additives** – plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, and fillers are blended in to tailor properties.  \n5. **Final product** – the polymer is processed into the final plastic item (e.g., a bottle, a pipe, a sheet).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key take‑aways\n\n- **Plastic = polymer**: long chains of repeating units.  \n- **Most plastics come from oil or natural gas** (petrochemicals).  \n- **Additives** give plastics their diverse properties.  \n- **Renewable‑source plastics** are emerging but still rely on polymer chemistry.  \n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like details on a specific type of plastic or the environmental impact of different polymers!",

If both eyes are severely impaired, the stricter criterion applies.\n\n---\n\n## How the criteria are measured\n\n| Measure | How it’s tested | Typical threshold for legal blindness |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | Snellen chart (or equivalent) at 20 ft (6 m). | 20/200 (or 6/60) or worse. |\n| **Visual field** | Humphrey perimetry or confrontation testing. | ≤ 20° (or 20° or less). |\n| **Contrast sensitivity** | Not part of the legal definition, but often used in clinical assessment. | – |\n\n### Example\n\n- **Patient A**: 20/250 in the right eye, 20/80 in the left eye → *legally blind* (right eye meets 20/200 criterion).\n- **Patient B**: 20/100 in both eyes, but visual field 15° in the better eye → *legally blind* (field criterion met).\n\n---\n\n## Why the definition matters\n\n| Purpose | How the definition is used |\n|---------|---------------------------|\n| **Disability benefits** | Determines eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), VA pensions, etc. |\n| **Employment accommodations** | Employers must provide reasonable accommodations under the ADA if an employee is legally blind. |\n| **Insurance** | Vision‑related coverage, disability insurance, and life insurance underwriting. |\n| **Public services** | Access to transportation subsidies, adaptive technology, and community programs. |\n\n---\n\n## Common misconceptions\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|---------|\n| “Legally blind” means you can’t see at all. | Many legally blind people have useful vision (e.g., reading with magnification, recognizing faces). |\n| Only people with 20/200 vision are legally blind. | The visual‑field criterion can also qualify someone (e.g., 20/100 acuity but a very narrow field). |\n| Legal blindness is the same everywhere. | While most countries use 20/200, some use 20/70 or 20/60 for certain programs; always check local regulations. |\n\n---\n\n## How to find out if you’re legally blind\n\n1. **Get a comprehensive eye exam** at an optometrist or ophthalmologist.  \n2. Ask for a **visual‑acuity chart** and a **visual‑field test**.  \n3. Request a **letter of documentation** that states your acuity and field results.  \n4. Compare the results to the thresholds above.  \n5. If you meet the criteria, you can apply for benefits or accommodations.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference\n\n- **Visual acuity ≤ 20/200** (or 20/70 if the other eye is 20/200) **and/or**  \n- **Visual field ≤ 20°** in the better eye.\n\nIf either condition is met, you are considered **legally blind** in most jurisdictions.",

How Ulcers Develop (Pathophysiology)\n\n1. **Barrier Breakdown** – The protective mucosal lining (mucus, bicarbonate, tight junctions) is compromised.\n2. **Acid/Enzyme Exposure** – In the GI tract, gastric acid and pepsin attack the exposed tissue.\n3. **Inflammation & Tissue Damage** – Immune cells infiltrate, releasing cytokines that further damage cells.\n4. **Healing vs. Chronicity** – If the underlying cause is removed and the environment is favorable, the ulcer can heal. Persistent irritation or infection keeps the ulcer open.\n\n---\n\n### 5. When to Seek Medical Care\n\n- **Severe or worsening pain** (especially if it wakes you from sleep).  \n- **Signs of bleeding** (vomiting blood, black stools).  \n- **Fever, chills, or signs of infection** (redness, warmth, pus).  \n- **Any ulcer that does not improve** after a few days of home care.  \n- **Pressure ulcers** that are deep, infected, or not healing.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Quick Take‑Away\n\n| Ulcer Type | Most Common Cause | Typical Symptom |\n|------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Peptic** | *H. pylori* or NSAIDs | Burning epigastric pain |\n| **Pressure** | Prolonged pressure | Redness or open wound over a bony area |\n| **Mouth** | Stress, minor trauma | Painful shallow sore in the mouth |\n| **Skin (diabetic)** | Poor circulation, neuropathy | Chronic, slow‑healing wound |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** An ulcer is a break in the protective lining of a body surface, most often caused by an imbalance between damaging agents (acid, pressure, infection) and the body’s protective mechanisms. Early recognition, treatment of the underlying cause, and proper wound care are key to preventing complications and promoting healing.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest you earn on both the original amount of money you invest (the principal) *and* on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n### The basic idea\n\n1. **Principal (P)** – the initial amount of money you invest or borrow.  \n2. **Rate (r)** – the interest rate per compounding period (expressed as a decimal).  \n3. **Number of compounding periods (n)** – how many times interest is added per year.  \n4. **Time (t)** – the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.\n\nThe future value (FV) of an investment after \\(t\\) years with compound interest is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{FV = P \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n t}}\n\\]\n\n- If interest is compounded **annually**: \\(n = 1\\).  \n- If compounded **semi‑annually**: \\(n = 2\\).  \n- If compounded **quarterly**: \\(n = 4\\).  \n- If compounded **monthly**: \\(n = 12\\).  \n- If compounded **daily**: \\(n = 365\\).  \n- If compounded **continuously**: the formula becomes \\(FV = P e^{rt}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Simple vs. Compound Interest\n\n| Feature | Simple Interest | Compound Interest |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Formula | \\(FV = P(1 + rt)\\) | \\(FV = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\) |\n| Interest added | Only on the principal | On principal **and** on accumulated interest |\n| Growth | Linear | Exponential (grows faster over time) |\n\n**Example (simple vs. compound)**  \n- Principal: \\$1,000  \n- Rate: 5 % per year  \n- Time: 3 years  \n\n| Method | Final amount |\n|--------|--------------|\n| Simple | \\(1{,}000 \\times (1 + 0.05 \\times 3) = \\$1{,}150\\) |\n| Compound (annual) | \\(1{,}000 \\times (1 + 0.05)^3 \\approx \\$1{,}157.63\\) |\n\nThe difference grows larger as the rate, time, or compounding frequency increases.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Savings accounts**: Banks often compound interest monthly or daily, so your money grows faster than if it were simple interest.  \n- **Loans**: Credit cards and mortgages compound interest, which can make the total cost of borrowing higher.  \n- **Investments**: Reinvesting dividends or interest can lead to significant wealth accumulation over decades.\n\n---\n\n### Quick mental check\n\n- **More frequent compounding** → higher effective yield.  \n- **Higher rate** → larger growth.  \n- **Longer time** → exponential increase.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Compound interest is the “interest on interest” that turns a modest investment into a larger sum over time, especially when the compounding frequency is high and the investment horizon is long.",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "### Hybridization – The Chemistry View\n\n**Hybridization** is a quantum‑mechanical model that explains how atoms form covalent bonds with geometries that differ from the shapes predicted by simple valence‑bond theory.  \nIt describes the *mixing* (or “hybridizing”) of atomic orbitals on the same atom to produce new, equivalent orbitals that point in directions that match the observed molecular geometry.\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry of hybrid orbitals | Typical bond angles | Common molecules |\n|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear | 180° | H₂, BeCl₂, CO₂ |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar | 120° | CH₃Cl, BF₃, C₆H₆ |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral | 109.5° | CH₄, NH₃, H₂O |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° | PCl₅, SF₄ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral | 90° | SF₆, XeF₆ |\n\n#### How It Works\n\n1. **Start with the valence orbitals** of the central atom (s, p, d).  \n2. **Combine** them mathematically to form new orbitals that are *linear combinations* of the originals.  \n3. **These hybrid orbitals** have the same energy (or nearly so) and are oriented in space to minimize electron‑pair repulsion, following VSEPR (Valence‑Shell Electron‑Pair Repulsion) rules.  \n4. **Bonds form** when two hybrid orbitals from different atoms overlap.\n\n#### Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 1s² 2s² 2p².  \n- The 2s and three 2p orbitals hybridize to give **four sp³ orbitals**.  \n- Each sp³ orbital overlaps with a hydrogen 1s orbital → four equivalent C–H σ bonds.  \n- Resulting geometry: tetrahedral, 109.5°.\n\n#### Why It Matters\n\n- **Predicts bond angles** and shapes of molecules.  \n- Explains why molecules like ammonia (NH₃) are *trigonal pyramidal* rather than trigonal planar, even though the central atom has three bonds (sp³ hybridization with a lone pair).  \n- Helps rationalize reactivity, polarity, and spectroscopic properties.\n\n---\n\n## Hybridization in Other Fields\n\n| Field | What “Hybridization” Means | Example |\n|-------|---------------------------|---------|\n| **Biology** | Cross‑breeding of two different species or varieties to combine desirable traits. | Hybrid corn, hybrid tea roses. |\n| **Computer Science** | Combining two or more programming paradigms or systems (e.g., hybrid cloud = on‑premises + public cloud). | Hybrid mobile apps (React Native). |\n| **Ecology** | Mixing of species or ecosystems, often due to human activity. | Hybrid zones where two species interbreed. |\n| **Materials Science** | Combining different materials to create composites with superior properties. | Carbon‑fiber reinforced polymers. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap\n\n- **Chemistry**: Hybridization = mixing of atomic orbitals to form new, directionally oriented orbitals that explain molecular geometry.  \n- **Other fields**: Generally means “mixing two distinct entities to create something new” (e.g., hybrid species, hybrid cloud).\n\nIf you had a specific context in mind (e.g., a particular molecule or a different discipline), let me know and I can dive deeper!",

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": "**Poliomyelitis (polio)** is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects the nervous system, especially the motor neurons that control muscle movement. It is caused by the poliovirus, a small, non‑enveloped, single‑stranded RNA virus belonging to the *Picornaviridae* family.\n\n---\n\n### 1. How the virus spreads\n| Mode | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Fecal‑oral** | Most common in areas with poor sanitation; virus is shed in stool and can contaminate food or water. |\n| **Oral‑oral** | Direct contact with an infected person’s saliva or respiratory secretions. |\n| **Occasional airborne** | Rare, via droplets in very close contact. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Clinical presentation\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–21 days (can be up to 3 weeks). Usually asymptomatic. |\n| **Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)** | Sudden onset of muscle weakness or paralysis, often asymmetric. Common sites: legs, arms, neck, diaphragm. |\n| **Severe cases** | Respiratory failure (if diaphragm/paralysis of respiratory muscles), bulbar paralysis, or death. |\n| **Post‑polio syndrome** | Years after recovery, patients may experience new weakness, fatigue, or pain. |\n\n*Note:* About 95 % of infections are asymptomatic; 1 % cause paralytic disease.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Diagnosis\n- **Clinical suspicion** of AFP in a child or young adult.\n- **Laboratory tests**: PCR or viral culture from stool, throat swab, or CSF; serology for poliovirus antibodies.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Treatment\n- **Supportive care**: Pain control, physiotherapy, respiratory support (ventilation) if needed.\n- **No antiviral therapy** is available; treatment focuses on preventing complications and aiding recovery.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Prevention\n| Strategy | Key Points |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). IPV is preferred in most countries; OPV is used in mass‑campaigns because it induces strong intestinal immunity. |\n| **Sanitation & hygiene** | Clean water, proper sewage disposal, handwashing. |\n| **Surveillance** | Monitoring AFP cases and environmental sampling of sewage for poliovirus. |\n\n- **Global eradication effort**: Since 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has reduced cases by >99 %. Polio remains endemic only in a few countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Nigeria).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Historical context\n- **First described** in the 19th century; widespread epidemics in the early 20th century.\n- **Polio vaccine**: Jonas Salk’s IPV (1955) and Albert Sabin’s OPV (1961) dramatically lowered incidence.\n- **Eradication milestones**: 1994 – WHO declared polio a “global emergency”; 2000 – GPEI launched; 2023 – last wild‑type polio case reported in Nigeria.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Key take‑away\nPoliomyelitis is a preventable viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis or death. Vaccination, good sanitation, and vigilant surveillance are the cornerstones of control and eventual eradication.",

The internal electric field at the p‑n junction pushes these electrons toward the front surface and holes (positive charge carriers) toward the back. By connecting the front and back contacts to an external circuit, the flow of electrons produces usable electric current.\n\n### Types of solar cells\n\n| Type | Material | Typical efficiency | Notes |\n|------|----------|--------------------|-------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon** | Single‑crystal Si | 20–25 % | High efficiency, uniform appearance, higher cost. |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon** | Multi‑crystal Si | 15–20 % | Lower cost, slightly lower efficiency. |\n| **Thin‑film (e.g., CdTe, CIGS)** | Layered semiconductors | 10–15 % | Flexible, lower material use, cheaper manufacturing. |\n| **Perovskite** | Organic‑inorganic perovskite | 20–25 % (lab) | Rapidly improving, potential for low‑cost, high‑efficiency cells. |\n| **Multi‑junction** | Stacked semiconductor layers | 30–40 % | Used in space and high‑performance applications. |\n\n### Applications\n\n- **Residential and commercial rooftop installations** – powering homes, businesses, and grid‑connected systems.\n- **Utility‑scale solar farms** – large arrays feeding electricity into the grid.\n- **Portable and off‑grid devices** – solar chargers, solar-powered lights, and remote sensors.\n- **Spacecraft and satellites** – solar panels provide the primary power source in orbit.\n\n### Why they matter\n\nSolar cells are a cornerstone of renewable energy because they:\n\n1. **Use abundant, free sunlight** – no fuel costs.\n2. **Produce clean electricity** – no greenhouse gas emissions during operation.\n3. **Can be deployed at many scales** – from tiny panels on a phone case to massive solar farms.\n\nIn short, a solar cell is a tiny, engineered piece of semiconductor material that turns photons into electrons, enabling us to harness the sun’s energy for everyday use.",

Some companies also offer additional perks such as extended health‑insurance coverage, outplacement services, or continued access to company resources. |\n| **How it’s calculated** | • **Length of service** (e.g., one week’s pay for each year worked). <br>• **Base salary or hourly rate**. <br>• **Company policy or negotiated agreement** (e.g., a fixed amount or a multiple of the employee’s last paycheck). |\n| **Legal status** | • In many countries, severance pay is **not mandatory** unless stipulated by a collective bargaining agreement, employment contract, or local labor law. <br>• In the U.S., the **Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act** requires certain employers to provide 60 days’ notice or pay in lieu of notice for large layoffs. <br>• In other jurisdictions (e.g., Canada, EU countries), statutory severance or “termination pay” may be required. |\n| **Tax treatment** | Usually treated as ordinary income and subject to withholding, though some jurisdictions allow partial tax‑free treatment for certain types of severance. |\n| **Common misconceptions** | • It’s not the same as **unemployment benefits** (which are government‑funded). <br>• It’s not a “bonus” or “reward”; it’s a contractual or statutory obligation. |\n| **Negotiation** | Employees can negotiate severance terms during a layoff or termination discussion, especially if they have a strong performance record or if the company is facing a difficult transition. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Severance pay is a payment (often cash, sometimes with added benefits) that an employer gives to an employee when the job ends, designed to ease the financial impact of the separation. Its amount and existence depend on company policy, contracts, collective agreements, and local labor laws.",

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": "### Semiconductors – The “Middle‑Ground” Materials of Modern Electronics\n\n| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| **What they are** | Materials whose electrical conductivity lies between that of conductors (e.g., copper) and insulators (e.g., glass). |\n| **Key property** | Their ability to have their conductivity *controlled* by adding impurities (doping) or by applying electric fields, light, or temperature changes. |\n| **Common materials** | Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Indium Phosphide (InP), Silicon Carbide (SiC), Gallium Nitride (GaN), etc. |\n| **Why “semi‑”** | They are *not* fully conductive like metals, but they can be made to conduct or block electricity as needed. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Semiconductors Work\n\n| **Concept** | **Detail** |\n|-------------|------------|\n| **Band theory** | Electrons occupy energy bands. In a semiconductor, the *valence band* (filled with electrons) is separated from the *conduction band* (empty) by a small energy gap (bandgap). |\n| **Bandgap size** | ~1.1 eV for silicon, ~0.66 eV for germanium, ~1.4 eV for GaAs. A smaller gap means easier electron excitation. |\n| **Intrinsic behavior** | Pure (intrinsic) semiconductor has few free carriers; conductivity is low at room temperature. |\n| **Doping** | Adding atoms with one extra or one fewer valence electron creates *n‑type* (extra electrons) or *p‑type* (holes) semiconductors. |\n| **p‑n junction** | When p‑type and n‑type regions meet, a depletion zone forms, enabling rectification, amplification, and switching. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Types of Semiconductor Devices\n\n| Device | Function | Typical Use |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| **Diode** | One‑way current flow | Rectifiers, signal demodulation |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET, JFET, etc.)** | Amplification, switching | CPUs, power supplies, RF amplifiers |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Complex logic, memory, analog functions | Smartphones, computers, automotive control |\n| **Photovoltaic cell** | Light to electricity | Solar panels |\n| **LED** | Light emission | Displays, indicators |\n| **Laser diode** | Coherent light | CD/DVD drives, fiber‑optic comms |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why Semiconductors Are Essential\n\n| Need | Semiconductor Solution |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Miniaturization** | Small, dense chips pack millions of transistors. |\n| **Energy efficiency** | Low‑power switching reduces heat and battery drain. |\n| **Speed** | Fast carrier mobility allows GHz‑scale operation. |\n| **Versatility** | Same material platform supports digital, analog, RF, optical, and power devices. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Materials & Their Roles\n\n| Material | Typical Applications | Advantages |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | CMOS logic, memory, solar cells | Mature fabrication, abundant, cost‑effective |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | High‑speed transistors, infrared detectors | Higher carrier mobility than Si |\n| **GaAs** | RF, microwave, laser diodes | Direct bandgap, high electron velocity |\n| **SiC** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | Wide bandgap → high voltage, high temperature |\n| **GaN** | Power switches, RF, LEDs | Wide bandgap, high electron saturation velocity |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Current Trends\n\n| Trend | What it means |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **FinFET & 3‑D transistors** | Further scaling beyond planar MOSFETs, reducing leakage. |\n| **Heterojunctions** | Combining materials (e.g., Si/SiGe) for strain‑enhanced mobility. |\n| **Flexible & wearable electronics** | Thin‑film semiconductors on polymers. |\n| **Quantum & photonic devices** | Silicon photonics, quantum dots for computing. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are engineered materials whose conductivity can be precisely tuned. This tunability underpins virtually every modern electronic device—from the microprocessor in your phone to the solar panel on your roof—making them the cornerstone of the digital age.",

It belongs to a group of disorders known as **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)**, which also include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, and the human form called **variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD)**.\n\n### Key facts\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Cause** | An abnormal, misfolded form of a normal protein called **prion protein (PrP)**. The misfolded prion induces other normal prions to misfold, leading to a chain reaction. |\n| **Pathology** | The brain develops sponge‑like holes (hence “spongiform”) and accumulates prion aggregates, causing neuronal loss and brain damage. |\n| **Incubation period** | Long—often 2–5 years in cattle, but can be longer. In humans, vCJD incubation can be decades. |\n| **Transmission in cattle** | Primarily through contaminated feed (e.g., protein meal from infected animals). The disease is not contagious via direct contact. |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Early signs: weight loss, decreased milk production, behavioral changes (e.g., nervousness, uncoordinated movements). Advanced stages: ataxia, tremors, loss of reflexes, and eventual death. |\n| **Human risk** | Consumption of infected beef products (especially brain, spinal cord, or other nervous tissue) can transmit vCJD. The risk is extremely low in countries with strict controls. |\n| **Control measures** | • **Feed bans**: prohibition of ruminant protein in animal feed. <br>• **Surveillance**: testing of cattle, especially those showing neurological signs. <br>• **Slaughterhouse controls**: removal of specified risk materials (SRMs) from animals that may carry prions. <br>• **Public health monitoring**: tracking of vCJD cases. |\n\n### History\n\n- **1955**: First case of BSE reported in the UK.\n- **1980s–1990s**: Outbreaks spread across the UK and other countries; led to widespread public concern.\n- **1996**: The UK government introduced a comprehensive BSE control program, including feed bans and mandatory testing.\n- **2000s–present**: BSE cases have dramatically declined in most countries, but sporadic cases still occur, mainly in the UK and a few other nations.\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Animal health**: BSE causes significant economic losses due to loss of livestock and trade restrictions.\n- **Human health**: vCJD is a rare but invariably fatal disease; its link to BSE underscores the importance of stringent food safety measures.\n- **Scientific interest**: Prions challenge traditional concepts of infectious agents, as they lack nucleic acids yet can propagate disease.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Mad cow disease (BSE) is a prion‑based neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can, through contaminated beef products, cause a fatal human disease (vCJD). It is largely controlled today through feed bans, surveillance, and removal of high‑risk tissues.",

      "question": "What is the location of Lake Champlain ?",
      "system_answer": "**Lake Champlain** is a long, narrow freshwater lake that straddles the border between the United States and Canada.  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Geographic setting** | • **United States**: Lies between the states of **Vermont** (west) and **New York** (east). <br>• **Canada**: Extends into the province of **Quebec** (north). |\n| **Length** | About **121 mi (194 km)** from its southern outlet at the **Champlain Canal** near Plattsburgh, NY, to its northern outlet at the **St. Lawrence River** near the town of **St. Albans, Vermont**. |\n| **Width** | Ranges from ~1 mi (1.6 km) in the narrowest parts to ~5 mi (8 km) in the widest sections. |\n| **Coordinates** | Roughly **43.5° N latitude** and **73.5° W longitude** (center of the lake). |\n| **Major towns/cities** | Plattsburgh (NY), Burlington (VT), St. Albans (VT), and the Canadian town of **St. Albans‑de‑Côte‑Sainte‑Marie** (QC). |\n| **Surrounding landmarks** | The lake is bordered by the Adirondack Mountains to the east and the Green Mountains to the west. The **Champlain Valley** runs along its southern shore. |\n\nSo, Lake Champlain is located in the northeastern part of North America, forming a natural boundary between Vermont and New York in the U.S., and extending into Quebec, Canada.",

      "question": "What is natural gas composed of ?",
      "system_answer": "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  \nIts composition is not fixed; it varies with the geological source, but the bulk of most natural‑gas supplies worldwide is made up of the following components:\n\n| Component | Typical range in a “clean” natural‑gas stream | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 85 – 95 % | The dominant constituent; the main energy source. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 1 – 5 % | Adds calorific value; used in petrochemical feedstock. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Often separated for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). |\n| **Butane (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.1 – 1 % | Also a component of LPG. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Inert; dilutes the gas and reduces heating value. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.1 – 3 % | Inert; can be removed for higher‑grade gas. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.01 % (often < 1 ppm) | Toxic; must be scrubbed out. |\n| **Other trace gases** | < 1 % | Includes helium, hydrogen, heavier hydrocarbons, and trace contaminants. |\n\n### Key points\n\n1. **Methane** is the energy‑rich core of natural gas; it is what makes the gas useful for heating, electricity generation, and as a chemical feedstock.\n2. **Ethane, propane, and butane** are heavier hydrocarbons that can be separated and sold as LPG or used in petrochemical processes.\n3. **Inert gases** such as nitrogen and CO₂ are naturally present and are usually removed or reduced to meet pipeline specifications.\n4. **Hydrogen sulfide** is a hazardous component that must be removed (via “sweetening”) before the gas can be transported or used.\n5. The exact mix depends on the reservoir (e.g., Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, offshore Gulf of Mexico, etc.) and the processing steps applied.\n\nSo, natural gas is a mixture dominated by methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons, inert gases, and trace contaminants.",
