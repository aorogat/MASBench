      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the heart‑rate range that you aim to stay within during aerobic exercise in order to achieve a specific training goal (e.g., improving cardiovascular fitness, burning fat, or training for a race).  \n\nIt’s usually expressed as a percentage of your maximum heart rate (MHR). The most common method to estimate MHR is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MHR} \\approx 220 - \\text{age}\n\\]\n\nTarget heart‑rate zones are then calculated as a percentage of that MHR:\n\n| Zone | % of MHR | Typical purpose |\n|------|----------|-----------------|\n| Light | 50–60 % | Warm‑up, recovery, general fitness |\n| Moderate | 60–70 % | Endurance training, fat burning |\n| Hard | 70–80 % | Aerobic conditioning, improved VO₂ max |\n| Very hard | 80–90 % | High‑intensity interval training (HIIT) |\n| Max | 90–100 % | Sprinting, short bursts, peak performance |\n\nDuring exercise, you monitor your heart rate (via a chest strap, wrist‑based monitor, or manual pulse check) and try to keep it within the desired zone. Staying in the target zone helps you train safely and effectively, ensuring you’re working hard enough to see benefits without overexerting.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Because the Sun actually emits almost white light, but the light that reaches our eyes is altered by Earth’s atmosphere.**\n\n1. **The Sun’s true color**  \n   - The Sun’s surface (photosphere) has a temperature of about 5,800 K.  \n   - A black‑body at that temperature radiates a spectrum that is very close to *white* (a mix of all visible wavelengths).  \n   - If you could view the Sun from space, it would look white (or very pale yellow‑white).\n\n2. **Atmospheric scattering**  \n   - As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet light is scattered in all directions by air molecules and tiny particles (Rayleigh scattering).  \n   - The blue light is scattered out of the direct path, leaving the light that reaches the observer enriched in longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red).  \n   - The effect is strongest when the Sun is low on the horizon (sunrise/sunset) – the light passes through more atmosphere, so the scattering is greater and the Sun looks reddish‑orange.\n\n3. **Human perception**  \n   - Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light, so the Sun’s slightly yellowish hue is what we perceive.  \n   - In daylight, the Sun’s light is often described as “warm” or “soft” because of this yellowish tint.\n\n4. **Other factors**  \n   - **Atmospheric pollution** or dust can enhance the scattering, making the Sun appear even more yellow or orange.  \n   - **Clouds** can reflect and scatter light, further altering the perceived color.\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is not actually yellow; it emits white light. The yellow appearance is a result of atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths and the way our eyes interpret the remaining light.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound, then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal, a system can determine distance, shape, speed, and sometimes material properties of the target.\n\n### How sonar works\n\n| Step | What happens | Key concept |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1. **Transmission** | A transducer (speaker‑like device) emits a short burst of sound (the “ping”). | Sound wave generation |\n| 2. **Propagation** | The sound travels through the medium (water, ice, air, etc.). | Speed of sound depends on temperature, salinity, depth, etc. |\n| 3. **Reflection** | The wave strikes an object and reflects back. | Reflection depends on the object’s size, shape, and material. |\n| 4. **Reception** | The transducer (now acting as a microphone) receives the echo. | Echo signal is recorded. |\n| 5. **Processing** | The system calculates the time delay between emission and reception, and analyzes the echo’s frequency, amplitude, and phase. | Distance = (speed of sound × time delay) ÷ 2; other parameters give shape, speed, etc. |\n\n### Types of sonar\n\n| Type | Purpose | Typical use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active sonar** | Emits a ping and listens for echoes. | Navigation, depth sounding, fish‑finding, submarine detection. |\n| **Passive sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships). | Anti‑submarine warfare, marine biology studies. |\n| **Side‑scan sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to image the seafloor. | Mapping, wreck detection, pipeline inspection. |\n| **Multibeam sonar** | Emits multiple beams to create high‑resolution bathymetric maps. | Hydrographic surveys, oceanographic research. |\n| **Subbottom profiling** | Sends low‑frequency sound to penetrate the seabed. | Geology, oil & gas exploration. |\n\n### Key applications\n\n- **Naval**: submarine detection, mine detection, navigation.\n- **Commercial**: fishing (fish‑finders), shipping navigation, offshore oil & gas.\n- **Scientific**: oceanography, seafloor mapping, marine biology.\n- **Recreational**: diving, boating, underwater photography.\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Safety**: Helps ships avoid underwater hazards and collisions.\n- **Efficiency**: Enables precise navigation and resource exploration.\n- **Environmental monitoring**: Tracks marine life, sediment movement, and underwater structures.\n\nIn short, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where light cannot reach.",

      "system_answer": "**Legally blind** (also called “visually impaired” in many contexts) is a medical‑legal classification used in the United States and many other countries to determine eligibility for disability benefits, accommodations, and services.  \nThe definition is based on two key measures of vision:\n\n| Criterion | What it means | Typical threshold |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | Sharpness of vision in the better‑seeing eye, measured with a Snellen chart (or equivalent). | **20/200 or worse** (i.e., what a person with normal vision can see at 200 ft, a legally blind person can only see at 20 ft). |\n| **Visual field** | The area a person can see without moving their eyes. | **Less than 20° of visual field** in the better eye (or a loss of 20° or more in either eye). |\n\n### How it’s applied\n\n1. **Best‑corrected vision**  \n   - The test is performed with the person wearing their best glasses or contact lenses.  \n   - If the acuity is 20/200 or worse *even with correction*, the person is considered legally blind.\n\n2. **Uncorrected vision**  \n   - If a person’s uncorrected vision is 20/200 or worse, they are also considered legally blind, regardless of whether they can improve it with lenses.\n\n3. **Visual field loss**  \n   - Even if visual acuity is better than 20/200, a loss of 20° or more in the visual field (e.g., tunnel vision) qualifies as legal blindness.\n\n### Why the definition matters\n\n- **Disability benefits** (Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, etc.) require proof of legal blindness.  \n- **Educational accommodations** (e.g., 504 plans, IDEA) and workplace accommodations (ADA) often use the same criteria.  \n- **Insurance and medical billing** may use the definition to determine coverage for low‑vision aids, mobility training, etc.\n\n### International variations\n\n- Many countries use similar thresholds (e.g., 20/200 in the U.S., 6/60 in the U.K.), but the exact numbers can differ slightly.  \n- Some jurisdictions also consider **contrast sensitivity** or **color vision** as part of the assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA person is legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity in the better eye is 20/200 or worse, or if they have a visual field of less than 20° in that eye. This classification is used to qualify for legal protections, benefits, and services.",

It can also spread via respiratory droplets in some outbreaks. |\n| **Incubation period** | 7–14 days (can range from 3–35 days). |\n| **Clinical spectrum** | 1. **Asymptomatic** – most infections (≈90 %) show no symptoms. 2. **Mild symptomatic** – fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild muscle aches. 3. **Flaccid paralysis** – the classic polio presentation, where the virus invades the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to sudden, asymmetric muscle weakness or paralysis. |\n| **Complications** | • Respiratory failure (if the diaphragm or intercostal muscles are affected). <br>• Post‑polio syndrome (late‑onset muscle weakness, fatigue). <br>• Rarely, chronic pain or joint problems. |\n| **Diagnosis** | • Clinical presentation (especially acute flaccid paralysis). <br>• Laboratory tests: viral isolation from stool or throat swab, PCR, or serology (antibody titers). |\n| **Treatment** | No antiviral therapy exists. Management is supportive: pain control, physical therapy, respiratory support if needed. |\n| **Prevention** | • **Vaccination** – the two main vaccines are: <br> – Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) given by injection. <br> – Oral polio vaccine (OPV) containing live attenuated virus (used in many countries for mass campaigns). <br>• Good sanitation and hygiene to prevent fecal‑oral spread. |\n| **Global status** | Polio has been eradicated in most of the world. As of 2023, only a few countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and a few islands) still report wild poliovirus cases. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative continues to aim for complete eradication. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Polio is a viral infection that can silently spread but may cause sudden paralysis; it is preventable with vaccination and has been largely eliminated worldwide.",

Their conductivity can be precisely controlled and altered by adding impurities (doping), applying electric fields, or changing temperature, making them the foundation of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n| Feature | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | The energy difference between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). In semiconductors, this gap is small enough that electrons can be excited into the conduction band with modest energy (e.g., light, heat, or voltage). |\n| **Doping** | Introducing small amounts of other elements (e.g., phosphorus or boron in silicon) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type), enabling the creation of p‑n junctions. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors are crystalline (e.g., silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide). The orderly lattice allows predictable electronic behavior. |\n\n---\n\n### Common Semiconductor Materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Integrated circuits, solar cells, power devices | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑frequency RF, LEDs, laser diodes | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 3.26 |\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | Power switches, blue LEDs | 3.4 |\n\n---\n\n### How They Work in Devices\n\n1. **p‑n Junction**  \n   - A p‑type region (holes) and an n‑type region (electrons) are joined.  \n   - At the junction, electrons recombine with holes, creating a depletion zone that acts as a diode.\n\n2. **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)**  \n   - Uses multiple p‑n junctions or field‑effect control to amplify or switch current.  \n   - Forms the building blocks of CPUs, memory, and power supplies.\n\n3. **Photovoltaic Cells**  \n   - Light excites electrons across the band gap, generating a voltage.  \n   - Silicon solar panels are the most common.\n\n4. **LEDs & Laser Diodes**  \n   - Electrons recombine with holes in a semiconductor, emitting photons.  \n   - The wavelength (color) depends on the band gap.\n\n---\n\n### Why Semiconductors Are Essential\n\n- **Miniaturization**: Their properties allow billions of transistors on a single chip.  \n- **Energy Efficiency**: Low power consumption compared to mechanical or vacuum‑tube devices.  \n- **Versatility**: Can be engineered for specific functions—high‑speed logic, low‑power sensors, high‑power motors, etc.  \n- **Integration**: Enables complex systems (smartphones, cars, data centers) to be built from a few chips.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSemiconductors are engineered materials whose electrical conductivity can be finely tuned. This tunability, combined with their crystalline structure and band‑gap properties, makes them indispensable for transistors, diodes, solar cells, LEDs, and virtually every modern electronic device.",

      "system_answer": "**Desktop publishing (DTP)** is the process of creating printed or digital documents—such as books, magazines, brochures, newsletters, flyers, and web pages—using a personal computer, specialized software, and peripheral devices (printers, scanners, etc.).  \n\n### Key Elements\n\n| Component | Role |\n|-----------|------|\n| **Computer** | Central workstation for design, layout, and editing. |\n| **Software** | Programs like Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, Microsoft Publisher, or Scribus that provide tools for text formatting, image placement, color management, and page layout. |\n| **Fonts & Typography** | Digital typefaces that can be scaled, styled, and embedded. |\n| **Graphics & Images** | Photographs, illustrations, logos, and vector graphics that are imported and manipulated. |\n| **Printing/Output** | High‑resolution printers, plotters, or digital presses that produce the final product. |\n| **File Formats** | PDF, PostScript, EPS, or other print‑ready files that preserve layout and quality. |\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Concept & Planning** – Define the purpose, target audience, and content structure.  \n2. **Design & Layout** – Use the DTP software to arrange text, images, and other elements on pages, applying styles, grids, and templates.  \n3. **Proofing & Editing** – Review for typographical errors, color consistency, and overall visual harmony.  \n4. **Export & Output** – Generate print‑ready files (PDF, PostScript) or web‑ready formats (HTML, JPEG).  \n5. **Printing or Distribution** – Send files to a printer or publish online.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n- **Speed & Flexibility** – Designers can quickly prototype, edit, and re‑print without expensive typesetting equipment.  \n- **Cost‑Effective** – Eliminates the need for large printing presses for small to medium runs.  \n- **Creative Control** – Full authority over typography, color, and layout, enabling brand consistency.  \n- **Accessibility** – Allows non‑professional users to produce high‑quality documents with user‑friendly interfaces.\n\nIn short, desktop publishing turns a computer into a powerful “mini‑press,” enabling individuals and small businesses to produce professional‑looking printed or digital materials efficiently and affordably.",

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a prion, which accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, producing a spongy, “honeycomb” appearance (hence the name “spongiform”).\n\n### Key Points\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Cause** | Misfolded prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) that induces normal prion proteins to misfold. |\n| **Transmission in cattle** | Primarily through contaminated feed (e.g., protein meal from infected animals). |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Ataxia (loss of coordination), weight loss, behavioral changes, and eventually death. |\n| **Human risk** | **Variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)** can occur when humans consume infected beef products. Symptoms include dementia, ataxia, and rapid neurological decline. |\n| **Control measures** | Strict feed bans, surveillance, testing of cattle, removal of high‑risk tissues, and culling of infected herds. |\n| **Economic impact** | Major losses in the beef industry, trade restrictions, and public health costs. |\n\nMad cow disease is a classic example of a prion disease, illustrating how a protein alone—without DNA or RNA—can propagate a disease and cause irreversible brain damage.",
