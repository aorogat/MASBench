      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Beneficial to the body\",\"reasoning\":\"In the investigation, Poirot notes that the window in room 238 was left open, unlike the other two rooms. The narrative explains that Richard Nigges himself opened the window, presumably to let fresh air circulate or to ease the body’s condition after death. Thus the window was opened for the benefit of the body rather than as a deliberate crime‑scene alteration.\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Suicide due to guilt and suffering\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative repeatedly states that Patrick Yves, overwhelmed by guilt over his affair with Nancy and the resulting tragedy, chose to end his life. He did not suffer a physical assault or poisoning; instead, he committed suicide as a consequence of his emotional turmoil and sense of betrayal. Thus the correct cause of death is suicide driven by guilt and suffering.\"}",
