This transfer was carried out through the legal process of a will, as indicated by the mention of a law firm handling the Canadian executors and the formal inheritance procedure.

Mr. and Mrs. Brand\nB. Miss Pema Khodro\nC. Mrs. Rival\nD. Mrs. Rumsfeld\n Output:",
      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Mr. and Mrs. Brand\",\"reasoning\":\"The letter from Inspector Hercule Poirot to Hercule Poirot states that the body originally thought to be Harry Castleton was actually identified as Quentin Durgeslin (the same person referred to as Quentin Ducassin in the question). It further notes that the prosecutor believes an arrest warrant can be issued for Mrs. Brand, implying she is the primary suspect. The narrative also indicates that the body was found in the Brand family’s backyard, and that Mrs. Brand’s inheritance and family ties are central to the plot. No evidence points to Miss Pema Khodro, Mrs. Rival, or Mrs. Rumsfeld as the killer, whereas Mr. and Mrs. Brand are directly implicated in the investigation. Therefore, the killer is most plausibly Mr. and Mrs. Brand.\"}",
