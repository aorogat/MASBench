The killer sprayed the perfume on the victim’s belongings and body, creating a scent that could be followed even in the dark, winding cave where visual cues and footsteps were unreliable.

Additionally, Hatakeyama’s alibi for the time of the murder was unverified; witnesses placed him near the scene, and forensic analysis of the crime scene matched his fingerprints on the weapon.  No other suspect—Zhídùjīng, Mu Geng Ju Nai, or Xiangxi Qin Painting—had any credible link to the location or the weapon, and their alibis were corroborated by multiple witnesses.
