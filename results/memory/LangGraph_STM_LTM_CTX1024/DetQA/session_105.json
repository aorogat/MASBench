      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Quinn has already identified the killer, but lacks evidence\",\"reasoning\":\"Detective Quinn (Quine) knew that Stephen Barry was the murderer but had no concrete proof. By having Michael write and send an extortion letter that mimicked Field’s blackmail threat, Quinn lured Barry into a situation where he would again use the same poison. This would give Quinn the tangible evidence needed to arrest and convict Barry. The letter was a deliberate trap, not a warning to Michael or a test of Fidel’s involvement, and it was not intended to uncover other suspects. Thus, the motive was to secure evidence against the already‑identified killer.\"}",
