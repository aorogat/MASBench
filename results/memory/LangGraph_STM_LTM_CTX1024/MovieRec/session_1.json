      "system_answer": "Hey! If you’re looking for a lesser‑known superhero flick that still packs the same mix of humor, action, and a bit of edge like *Deadpool* or *Batman Returns*, I’d recommend **“Kick‑Ass” (2010)**. It’s a comic‑book‑style movie with a gritty, over‑the‑top vibe, a great ensemble cast (including James McAvoy, Michael Keaton, and Christopher Mintz‑Laurie), and plenty of dark humor. It’s not as mainstream as the big superhero blockbusters, but it’s a cult‑favorite that many fans of the genre love. \n\nLet me know if you’d like another suggestion or if you’re leaning toward a different sub‑genre!",

      "system_answer": "Sounds like you’re in the mood for a solid crime‑drama with a mix of gritty realism and strong character work. Here are a few that fit the bill:\n\n| Movie | Year | Why it fits |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| **The Town** | 2010 | A heist‑drama set in Boston’s Charlestown, directed by and starring Ben Affleck. It’s tense, character‑driven, and has that “Mystic River”‑style emotional core. |\n| **Sicario** | 2015 | A tense, atmospheric look at the drug war on the U.S.–Mexico border. Like *Training Day*, it’s a moral gray‑zone thriller with a strong lead performance by Emily Blunt. |\n| **Heat** | 1995 | A classic cat‑and‑mouse crime saga featuring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. The cat‑and‑mouse dynamic and the ensemble cast give it a timeless feel. |\n| **The Departed** (you already liked it) | 2006 | If you’re looking for more of that style, consider **The Irishman** (2019) – another Martin Scorsese crime epic, though it’s longer and more reflective. |\n| **Inside Man** | 2006 | A clever bank‑robbery thriller with a twisty plot and a strong ensemble (Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster). |\n| **The Godfather** | 1972 | The quintessential crime saga. If you haven’t seen it yet, it’s a must‑watch for any crime‑film fan. |\n| **No Country for Old Men** | 2007 | A tense, atmospheric crime thriller with a bleak, moralistic tone. |\n| **The Place Beyond the Pines** | 2012 | A multi‑generational crime drama that blends family drama with crime‑drama elements. |\n\nIf you’re looking for something a bit lighter or more recent, let me know and I can suggest a few newer releases that still keep the crime‑drama spirit alive.

      "system_answer": "Sure thing! Since you’re a fan of *The Shawshank Redemption*, you’ll probably enjoy **The Green Mile** (1999). It’s another powerful drama from the same director (Frank Darabont) with a mix of hope, redemption, and a touch of the supernatural. The story follows a death‑row guard who encounters a mysterious inmate with extraordinary abilities—think a blend of *Shawshank*’s emotional depth and a bit of *The Mist*‑style intrigue.\n\nIf you’re up for something a little different but still in that same vein of character‑driven storytelling, you might also like:\n\n- **The Pursuit of Happyness** (2006) – a heartfelt, real‑life drama about perseverance and father‑son bonds.\n- **The Departed** (2006) – a gritty crime thriller with stellar performances and a twisty plot.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details or another recommendation!",

Eddie Murphy better be worth it.\nSystem: ",
      "system_answer": "Hey! 🎉\n\n**Shrek (2001)** is a great pick for a light‑hearted, “childish” vibe. Here’s the quick rundown:\n\n| Topic | What to Expect |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Fart jokes** | Shrek has a few classic “fart” moments (think the swamp‑fart scene and the “farting” donkey), but it’s not a nonstop fart‑fest. The humor is more about word‑play, pop‑culture references, and the lovable banter between Shrek and Donkey. |\n| **Eddie Murphy (Donkey)** | Eddie’s voice work is a huge part of the film’s charm. He brings a goofy, energetic, and slightly sarcastic personality to Donkey, which is why many people love the character. If you’re a fan of Eddie’s comedic timing, you’ll definitely enjoy his performance. |\n| **Family‑friendly** | The film is rated PG, so it’s safe for most kids (though some scenes are a bit crude for very young viewers). It’s a good mix of humor, heart, and a bit of fairy‑tale satire. |\n\n**If you’re looking for something similar** (animated, comedic, and a bit “childish” but still mature enough for adults), you might also like:\n\n1. **The Princess Bride (1987)** – a fairy‑tale adventure with witty dialogue and a fun mix of romance, action, and humor.  \n2. **Monsters, Inc. (2001)** – another Pixar gem with a playful tone and a great comedic duo (James P. Sullivan & Mike Wazowski).  \n3. **Despicable Me (2010)** – a family‑friendly comedy with a lovable villain and a sidekick that’s as funny as Donkey.  \n4. **The Lego Movie (2014)** – a clever, fast‑paced animated film that’s full of jokes and pop‑culture nods.  \n5. **The Incredibles (2004)** – a superhero family adventure with a good balance of action and humor.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of those, or if you’re curious about where to stream Shrek or the other titles!

If you’re looking for films that capture that same surreal, unsettling vibe, here are a few recommendations:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it’s similar |\n|------|------|------------------|\n| **Blue Velvet** | 1986 | Lynch’s first feature—dark, dream‑like, and full of bizarre imagery. |\n| **Lost Highway** | 1997 | A Lynchian mind‑bender with a fractured narrative and eerie atmosphere. |\n| **Mulholland Drive** | 2001 | A surreal, neo‑noir mystery that plays with reality and memory. |\n| **The Elephant Man** | 1980 | While not Lynch, it shares a haunting, almost dream‑like tone and a focus on the grotesque. |\n| **Inland Empire** | 2006 | Lynch’s most experimental film—long, looping, and deeply atmospheric. |\n| **The Double Life of Veronique** | 1991 | A visually poetic film by Krzysztof Kieślowski that feels Lynch‑ish in its mood and symbolism. |\n| **The Lobster** | 2015 | A quirky, dystopian satire with a surreal twist—if you like Lynch’s off‑beat humor. |\n| **The Cell** | 2000 | A psychological thriller with striking visuals and a dream‑like structure. |\n| **The Fountain** | 2006 | Darren Aronofsky’s visually lush, metaphysical journey that echoes Lynch’s style. |\n\nIf you’re looking for something more recent but still in that uncanny, surreal vein, you might also enjoy:\n\n- **Midsommar** (2019) – Ari Aster’s daylight horror with a cult‑like atmosphere.  \n- **The Lighthouse** (2019) – a psychological horror with a haunting, almost Lynchian aesthetic.  \n- **The Endless** (2017) – a sci‑fi horror that plays with time and reality in a very Lynch‑like way.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re after a specific mood (e.g., more horror, more psychological, more surreal).
