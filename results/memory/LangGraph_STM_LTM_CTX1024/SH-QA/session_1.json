It retained many Norman‑specific phonological traits (e.g., the nasal vowels *an, en, in, on* pronounced as *am, em, im, om*), but it also absorbed a large amount of English vocabulary and syntax.  The spelling was still largely French‑based, but the grammar had begun to show English influence (e.g., the use of the definite article *the* in French‑derived words).\n\n- **When it faded**  \n  The final phase of Anglo‑Norman lasted roughly from 1200 to 1350.  After the Black Death, the Hundred Years’ War, and the rise of a more unified English legal and literary culture, the language was gradually displaced by Middle English.  By the late 14th century it was largely confined to the courts, the Church, and the administration of the royal household, and it eventually disappeared as a living language.\n\n- **Why it matters**  \n  The “final form” of Anglo‑Norman is the same linguistic stage that produced the legal and administrative documents of the 13th century (e.g., the *Patent Rolls*, *Close Rolls*, and the *Chronicles of the *Chronicon*).  It is also the source of many English words that entered the language during the Middle English period (e.g., *court*, *judge*, *law*, *king*, *queen*).\n\nSo, in short: the Anglo‑Norman language’s final form was a late‑medieval, Middle‑French‑based dialect that survived in England until the mid‑14th century, after which it was largely supplanted by Middle English.",

      "system_answer": "The most significant classical‑music developments linked to Normandy took place in the **19th century**.  During that period the region saw the rise of a distinct “Normandy School” of composers and the establishment of local conservatories, which helped shape the Romantic and early modern musical landscape in France.",

      "system_answer": "**Computational complexity theory classifies problems by the amount of computational resources they require—most commonly the time (and sometimes space) needed to solve them.**  \n\nIn practice, problems are grouped into classes such as **P, NP, PSPACE, EXP**, etc., where each class is defined by a bound on the resources (e.g., “solvable in polynomial time” for P, “verifiable in polynomial time” for NP). Thus, the main attribute used for classification is the *resource‑usage profile* (time, space, or other computational resources) of the problem.",

In complexity theory we often refer to this more generally as the **computational complexity** of the problem, which can also include space or other resources, but time complexity is the primary metric used to classify how hard a problem is.",
