This helps cue your body for sleep.\n3. **Keep it flexible** – It’s okay to swap activities week to week. The goal is to create a habit that feels enjoyable, not a rigid chore.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Starter Plan (for a typical weekday evening)**\n\n| Time | Activity |\n|------|----------|\n| 6:30 pm | Finish work, quick 5‑min stretch |\n| 6:35 pm | Cook a simple dinner (15‑20 min) |\n| 7:00 pm | Eat, then 10‑min walk or light yoga |\n| 7:20 pm | 20‑min reading or journaling |\n| 7:40 pm | 10‑min meditation or breathing |\n| 7:50 pm | Prepare for bed (brush, wash face) |\n| 8:00 pm | Lights out / sleep |\n\nFeel free to tweak the times or swap in any of the activities above.
