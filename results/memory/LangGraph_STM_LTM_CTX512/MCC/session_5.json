      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "Enzymes are biological catalysts—usually proteins (though some RNA molecules can act as enzymes, called ribozymes)—that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms. They work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction, allowing metabolic processes to occur rapidly and under the mild conditions (temperature, pH) found inside cells. Each enzyme is highly specific for its substrate(s) and can be regulated by various mechanisms (inhibition, activation, allosteric control, etc.) to maintain the proper balance of biochemical pathways.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun itself does not have a “yellow” color—it emits a broad spectrum of light that is essentially **white** (or very slightly yellow‑ish in the visible range).  The reason we normally see it as yellow (or sometimes orange or red) is due to the way Earth’s atmosphere interacts with that light.\n\n### 1. The Sun’s intrinsic spectrum  \n- The Sun is a hot, roughly 5,800 K black‑body radiator.  \n- Its spectrum peaks in the green‑yellow part of the visible range, but it emits strongly across the entire visible spectrum (and beyond into UV and IR).  \n- If you could view the Sun from space, or from a high‑altitude balloon, it would appear almost white.\n\n### 2. Atmospheric scattering (Rayleigh scattering)  \n- As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered in all directions by air molecules and small particles.  \n- The longer‑wavelength light (yellow, orange, red) travels more directly to the observer.  \n- When the Sun is high in the sky, the path through the atmosphere is short, so the blue light is only slightly scattered and the Sun looks white or very pale yellow.  \n- When the Sun is near the horizon (sunrise/sunset), the light must pass through a much thicker layer of air, scattering away most of the blue light and leaving the longer wavelengths, so the Sun appears orange or red.\n\n### 3. Human perception and color mixing  \n- Our eyes are more sensitive to green and yellow wavelengths, so a mixture of all colors (white) can appear slightly yellowish to us.  \n- The sky itself is blue because of the same scattering, and the Sun’s light is the dominant source of that scattered light.\n\n### 4. Other factors  \n- **Atmospheric pollution** or aerosols can enhance scattering, sometimes making the Sun look more orange or reddish.  \n- **Solar activity** (sunspots, flares) can slightly alter the Sun’s spectral output, but the effect on perceived color is negligible for everyday observation.\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is essentially white; it looks yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters away the blue part of its spectrum, leaving the longer wavelengths that dominate the visible light we receive.",

When that pulse encounters an object, it reflects back. The system measures the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal.  \n- **Key functions**:  \n  - **Detection**: Finding objects (e.g., fish, submarines, underwater terrain).  \n  - **Range**: Calculating distance based on echo travel time.  \n  - **Bearing**: Determining direction of the target.  \n  - **Imaging**: Creating maps or images of underwater structures (e.g., side‑scan sonar).  \n- **Types**:  \n  - **Active sonar** – emits pulses and listens for echoes.  \n  - **Passive sonar** – listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships).  \n- **Applications**: Navigation, depth sounding, fish-finding, submarine detection, underwater archaeology, and scientific research.",

      "system_answer": "**Legally blind** (also called “visually impaired” in many jurisdictions) is a medical‑legal classification used to determine eligibility for disability benefits, vision‑screening programs, and other services.  \nThe standard definition is based on two key measures of visual function:\n\n| Measure | Criterion | What it means |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | **20/200 or worse** in the better‑seeing eye, even with the best possible correction (glasses or contact lenses). | You can read a line on a Snellen chart that a person with normal vision can read at 200 ft. |\n| **Visual field** | **Less than 20°** of the visual field (i.e., a “tunnel vision” of 20 degrees or less). | The area you can see without moving your eyes is narrower than a 20‑degree cone. |\n\n**How it’s applied**\n\n1. **Best‑corrected acuity** is measured first. If the better eye is 20/200 or worse, the person is considered legally blind, regardless of field loss.  \n2. If the acuity is better than 20/200, the visual field is checked. If the field is 20° or less, the person is also considered legally blind.  \n3. If neither criterion is met, the person is not legally blind, even if they have significant vision loss.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Eligibility for services**: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), state vision‑screening programs, and many other benefits use this definition.  \n- **Legal protection**: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other laws use the same standard to determine disability status.  \n- **Insurance and medical billing**: Some insurance plans and medical billing codes use the 20/200 or 20° field thresholds to classify blindness for coverage purposes.\n\n**Note on variations**\n\n- Some states or countries use slightly different thresholds (e.g., 20/400 or 20° field) or add additional criteria such as contrast sensitivity.  \n- The definition is intended for *functional* blindness, not for diagnosing a specific eye disease.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA person is legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity in the better eye is 20/200 or worse, or if their visual field is 20° or less.",

      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money you invest or borrow (the *principal*), but also on the interest that has already accumulated.  \nIn other words, the interest “compounds” or “re‑invests” itself, so each period you earn interest on a larger base.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example (simple numbers) |\n|------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| 1. **Start** | You deposit or owe a principal amount, \\(P\\). | $1,000 |\n| 2. **First period** | Interest is calculated on \\(P\\). | 5 % → $50 |\n| 3. **Add interest** | The interest is added to the principal, creating a new balance, \\(P_1 = P + \\text{interest}\\). | $1,050 |\n| 4. **Next period** | Interest is now calculated on \\(P_1\\). | 5 % of $1,050 → $52.50 |\n| 5. **Repeat** | Continue adding the new interest to the balance each period. | After 2 periods: $1,102.50 |\n\nBecause the base grows each time, the total interest earned over time is larger than if you only earned interest on the original principal (simple interest).\n\n---\n\n### Formula\n\nFor an amount \\(P\\) invested at an annual nominal rate \\(r\\) compounded \\(n\\) times per year, after \\(t\\) years the balance \\(A\\) is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(P\\) = principal  \n- \\(r\\) = annual interest rate (decimal)  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year  \n- \\(t\\) = number of years  \n\nIf compounding is **continuous** (theoretically infinite times per year), the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = P\\,e^{rt}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Scenario | Simple interest | Compound interest |\n|----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| 1 year at 5 % on $1,000 | $50 | $50 |\n| 2 years at 5 % on $1,000 | $100 | $105.13 |\n| 10 years at 5 % on $1,000 | $500 | $1,628.89 |\n\nThe difference grows with higher rates, longer time, and more frequent compounding.\n\n---\n\n### Practical examples\n\n| Context | How compounding helps |\n|---------|-----------------------|\n| **Savings account** | Your money earns interest on the interest it has already earned. |\n| **Mortgage** | The interest you pay each month is calculated on the remaining balance, which itself has grown due to previous interest. |\n| **Investments** | Dividends or capital gains that are reinvested generate additional returns. |\n| **Loans** | If you make extra payments, the remaining balance shrinks faster, reducing the total interest paid. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nCompound interest is the “interest on interest” effect that lets money grow faster over time. It’s a key principle behind savings, investments, and many financial products.",

      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that are better suited for bonding in molecules.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Geometry**: The shape of a molecule (e.g., linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, octahedral) is determined by the hybrid orbitals that the central atom uses.\n- **Bonding**: Hybrid orbitals can overlap with orbitals on other atoms to form sigma bonds, and the remaining unhybridized orbitals can form pi bonds.\n\n---\n\n### Common hybridization types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂ |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, C₃H₆ |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n---\n\n### How it works (simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count its valence electrons.\n2. **Determine the number of electron‑pair domains** (bonding pairs + lone pairs) around that atom.\n3. **Assign a hybridization** that matches that number of domains (e.g., 4 domains → sp³).\n4. **Construct the hybrid orbitals**: combine the appropriate s, p, (and sometimes d) orbitals to form the hybrid set.\n5. **Use the hybrids** to form sigma bonds with other atoms; any remaining p orbitals can form pi bonds.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons → 4 bonding pairs with hydrogen.\n- 4 electron‑pair domains → **sp³ hybridization**.\n- Four sp³ orbitals (each 25% s, 75% p) point toward the corners of a tetrahedron.\n- Each sp³ orbital overlaps with an H 1s orbital to form a C–H sigma bond.\n\n---\n\n### Key take‑away\nHybridization is a useful model that helps chemists predict and rationalize the shapes and bonding patterns of molecules. It’s not a literal “mixing” of orbitals in the physical sense, but a convenient way to describe how atoms form bonds in a way that matches observed molecular geometry.",

      "question": "What is mold ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in damp, warm, and poorly ventilated environments. It reproduces by releasing microscopic spores that can spread through the air or on surfaces. When the spores land on a suitable substrate (e.g., wood, drywall, food, or skin), they germinate and form a network of thread‑like cells called mycelium, which can produce visible colonies that appear fuzzy or powdery in various colors (green, black, white, etc.).  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Biology** | Fungi that break down organic matter, often thriving on moisture and decaying material. |\n| **Growth** | Requires moisture, a food source, and a suitable temperature (typically 20–30 °C). |\n| **Health impact** | Can trigger allergies, asthma, and respiratory irritation; some species produce mycotoxins that are toxic if ingested or inhaled. |\n| **Common locations** | Bathrooms, basements, kitchens, attics, and any area with water leaks or high humidity. |\n| **Control** | Reduce moisture, improve ventilation, fix leaks, clean with mold‑removing solutions, and remove heavily infested materials. |\n\nIn short, mold is a fungal organism that thrives in damp conditions, spreads via spores, and can cause both structural damage and health problems.",
