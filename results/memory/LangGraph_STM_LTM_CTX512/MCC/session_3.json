      "question": "i need a recipe for chicken cordon bleu",
      "system_answer": "Here’s a classic, crowd‑pleasing recipe for **Chicken Cordon Bleu**. It’s simple, flavorful, and perfect for a week‑night dinner or a special occasion.\n\n---\n\n## Ingredients\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts | 4 | Flattened to 1/2‑inch thickness |\n| Swiss cheese slices | 4 | (or Gruyère, provolone, or a mix) |\n| Cooked ham slices | 4 | Thin, deli‑style or thinly sliced cooked ham |\n| All‑purpose flour | 1/4 cup | For dusting |\n| Eggs | 2 | Beaten |\n| Bread crumbs | 1 cup | (Panko or regular) |\n| Olive oil or melted butter | 2 Tbsp | For cooking |\n| Salt | 1/2 tsp | |\n| Black pepper | 1/4 tsp | |\n| Optional: Dijon mustard or mayonnaise | 1 Tbsp | For a little extra flavor |\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Prep the chicken**  \n   - Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper.  \n   - Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch.  \n   - Season both sides lightly with salt and pepper.\n\n2. **Assemble the roulades**  \n   - Lay a slice of ham on each breast, then a slice of cheese on top of the ham.  \n   - Roll the breast tightly, securing with a toothpick or kitchen twine if needed.\n\n3. **Dredge the rolls**  \n   - Set up a dredging station:  \n     1. Flour in a shallow dish.  \n     2. Beaten eggs in another shallow dish.  \n     3. Bread crumbs in a third shallow dish.  \n   - Coat each chicken roll first in flour, shaking off excess.  \n   - Dip in the beaten eggs, then coat with bread crumbs.  \n   - For extra crunch, you can double‑coat: repeat the egg and breadcrumb step.\n\n4. **Cook**  \n   - Heat the olive oil or melted butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  \n   - Add the chicken rolls, skin‑side down if you used skin, and cook for 3–4 minutes per side, until golden brown.  \n   - Transfer the browned rolls to a preheated oven at 375 °F (190 °C) and bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C) and the cheese is melted.\n\n5. **Serve**  \n   - Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing.  \n   - Serve with a simple side such as roasted potatoes, a green salad, or steamed asparagus.  \n   - If you like, drizzle a little melted butter or a squeeze of lemon over the top for extra brightness.\n\n---\n\n### Tips & Variations\n\n- **Cheese & Ham Choices**: Swiss is classic, but Gruyère, provolone, or even a sharp cheddar can work. For a different flavor, try smoked ham or turkey ham.\n- **Breadcrumbs**: Panko gives a lighter, crunchier coating. For a gluten‑free version, use gluten‑free breadcrumbs or crushed cornflakes.\n- **Sauce**: A quick pan sauce can elevate the dish. After removing the chicken, deglaze the skillet with a splash of white wine or chicken broth, add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, and whisk until thickened. Pour over the sliced chicken.\n- **Make‑Ahead**: Assemble the rolls ahead of time and refrigerate (up to 24 h). Just add the coating and cook as directed.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu! If you have any questions or want a side‑dish suggestion, just let me know.",
