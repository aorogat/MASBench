This is often described by the “lock‑and‑key” or “induced fit” model. |\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins composed of one or more polypeptide chains folded into a precise three‑dimensional shape. The active site—where the substrate binds—contains amino‑acid residues that interact with the substrate. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by:  <br>• **Allosteric effectors** (activators or inhibitors that bind elsewhere on the enzyme). <br>• **Covalent modifications** (e.g., phosphorylation). <br>• **Gene expression** (how much enzyme is produced). |\n| **Reusability** | After the reaction, the enzyme is unchanged and can catalyze many more cycles. |\n| **Examples** | • **Amylase** – breaks down starch into sugars. <br>• **DNA polymerase** – synthesizes DNA strands. <br>• **Lactase** – digests lactose into glucose and galactose. |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the workhorses of metabolism, enabling the complex chemistry of life to occur efficiently and under mild conditions.",

There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, and Asia 1). |\n| **Transmission** | • Direct contact with infected animals or contaminated bodily fluids (saliva, milk, feces). <br>• Indirect contact via contaminated equipment, clothing, feed, or vehicles. <br>• Airborne spread over short distances (especially in windy conditions). |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (often 1–3 days before lesions). <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that rupture into ulcers on the tongue, lips, inside the mouth, and on the teats (in cattle). <br>• Swelling of the feet and hooves, especially in young animals. <br>• Reduced appetite, weight loss, and decreased milk production. |\n| **Affected species** | Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, antelope, and many other cloven‑hoofed mammals. |\n| **Economic impact** | • Losses from decreased milk and meat production. <br>• Trade restrictions and export bans. <br>• Costs of vaccination, culling, and movement controls. |\n| **Control measures** | • Strict movement controls and quarantine of infected or exposed animals. <br>• Mass vaccination (often with inactivated or live‑attenuated vaccines). <br>• Culling of infected and exposed animals in some countries. <br>• Biosecurity practices (disinfection, controlled access, feed and water hygiene). |\n| **Human health** | FMD is not a zoonotic disease; it does not infect humans. However, it can be transmitted to people via contact with infected animals or contaminated products, causing mild flu‑like symptoms in rare cases. |\n| **Global status** | The disease is endemic in many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, while it is largely eradicated in North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Outbreaks in any country can trigger international trade restrictions. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of cloven‑hoofed animals, leading to significant economic losses in the livestock industry.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated.  \nIn other words, the interest “compounds” or “re‑invests” itself, so each period you earn interest on a larger base.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The basic formula\n\nFor an investment that compounds **n** times per year, with an annual nominal rate **r** (expressed as a decimal), and a principal **P**, the amount **A** after **t** years is\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- **P** – initial principal  \n- **r** – annual interest rate (e.g., 5 % → 0.05)  \n- **n** – number of compounding periods per year  \n- **t** – number of years\n\nThe **interest earned** is \\(A - P\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Common compounding frequencies\n\n| Compounding frequency | n | Example: 5 % annual rate |\n|-----------------------|---|--------------------------|\n| Annually (once a year) | 1 | \\(A = P(1+0.05)^t\\) |\n| Semi‑annually (twice a year) | 2 | \\(A = P(1+0.025)^{2t}\\) |\n| Quarterly | 4 | \\(A = P(1+0.0125)^{4t}\\) |\n| Monthly | 12 | \\(A = P(1+0.0041667)^{12t}\\) |\n| Daily (≈ 365 times) | 365 | \\(A = P(1+0.00013699)^{365t}\\) |\n\nThe more frequently interest is compounded, the larger the final amount.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Continuous compounding\n\nWhen compounding happens an infinite number of times per year, the formula becomes\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\).  \nThis is often used in finance theory and for very high‑frequency compounding.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Example\n\nSuppose you invest \\$1,000 at an annual rate of 6 % compounded monthly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)  \n- \\(r = 0.06\\)  \n- \\(n = 12\\)  \n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{36}\n  \\approx 1{,}000 \\times 1.197 \\approx 1{,}197\n\\]\n\nYou would have about **\\$1,197** after 3 years, earning roughly **\\$197** in interest.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Why it matters\n\n- **Growth advantage**: Even a modest rate can produce a large difference over time because the interest itself earns interest.\n- **Savings & loans**: Banks use compound interest to calculate interest on deposits and loans.\n- **Investment planning**: Understanding compounding helps you set realistic goals and compare financial products.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Compound interest is the “interest on interest” that lets your money grow faster than simple interest, where interest is calculated only on the original principal.",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is the process of combining two different entities—whether organisms, molecules, or languages—to create a new, mixed product that contains characteristics of both parents.  The term is used in several scientific and cultural fields; the core idea is the same: *mixing to produce something that is partly one thing and partly another.*\n\n| Field | What is hybridized | Typical purpose / outcome |\n|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Biology / Genetics** | Two different species, varieties, or breeds | Produce offspring that combine desirable traits (e.g., disease resistance, higher yield, ornamental beauty).  Example: a hybrid corn plant that is both drought‑tolerant and high‑yielding. |\n| **Chemistry** | Atomic orbitals or molecules | Create new chemical bonds or compounds with unique properties.  Example: the hybridization of carbon’s 2s and 2p orbitals (sp³, sp², sp) determines the geometry of organic molecules. |\n| **Linguistics** | Two languages or dialects | Generate a new language variety or pidgin.  Example: Creole languages that arise when speakers of different tongues need to communicate. |\n| **Botany** | Two plant varieties or species | Produce a hybrid plant that may have improved growth, flavor, or resistance.  Example: the “F1” hybrid tomato that is more productive than either parent. |\n| **Genetics (Molecular)** | DNA strands from different parents | Create recombinant DNA for research or biotechnology.  Example: plasmid vectors that combine genes from two organisms. |\n| **Cultural / Social** | Two cultural traditions | Form a new hybrid culture or art form.  Example: fusion cuisine that blends Mexican and Japanese flavors. |\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Cross‑breeding vs. Hybridization**  \n   - *Cross‑breeding* is a broader term that can involve any mating between individuals.  \n   - *Hybridization* specifically refers to the creation of a hybrid that is distinct from either parent, often with new or enhanced traits.\n\n2. **Hybrid Vigor (Heterosis)**  \n   - Many hybrids exhibit *heterosis*, where they outperform both parents in growth, yield, or resilience.\n\n3. **Hybridization in Chemistry**  \n   - Orbital hybridization (sp, sp², sp³) explains molecular shapes and bonding patterns.  \n   - Chemical hybridization can also refer to mixing different chemical species to form alloys or composites.\n\n4. **Hybridization in Linguistics**  \n   - Pidgins arise when speakers of different languages need a simplified communication system.  \n   - Creoles develop when a pidgin becomes fully developed and nativized.\n\n5. **Hybridization in Technology**  \n   - Hybrid vehicles combine internal combustion engines with electric motors.  \n   - Hybrid cloud computing blends on‑premises and public cloud resources.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nHybridization is the intentional or natural blending of two distinct sources to produce a new entity that carries traits from both. Whether you’re talking about plants, genes, molecules, or languages, the concept revolves around *mixing to create something novel and often superior.*",
