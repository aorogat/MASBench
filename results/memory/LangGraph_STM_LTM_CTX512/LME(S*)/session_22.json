      "system_answer": "Here are a handful of quick, “extra‑something” ideas that can instantly elevate your chocolate‑chip cookies:\n\n| What to add | Why it works | How to do it |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Sea‑salt crystals** | A touch of salt balances sweetness and brings out the chocolate’s depth. | Sprinkle a pinch of flaky sea salt on top of each cookie just before baking, or add ½ tsp to the dough. |\n| **Espresso or instant coffee powder** | Intensifies chocolate flavor without making the cookie taste like coffee. | Stir 1–2 tsp of espresso powder into the dry ingredients. |\n| **Brown butter** | Adds a nutty, caramel‑like richness. | Melt butter in a pan until it turns golden brown and foamy; cool slightly before mixing into the dough. |\n| **Nuts (walnuts, pecans, almonds)** | Adds crunch and a subtle nutty flavor. | Roughly chop ½–1 cup of nuts and fold into the dough. |\n| **Dried fruit (cranberries, cherries, raisins)** | Provides chewy bursts of sweetness and a pop of color. | Toss ½ cup of dried fruit with a tablespoon of flour to prevent clumping, then fold in. |\n| **Chocolate chips with a twist** | Dark chocolate, white chocolate, or chocolate chips with sea‑salt, chili, or orange zest give a new flavor profile. | Swap your standard chips for a mix of at least two varieties. |\n| **Caramel swirl** | A drizzle of caramel inside the cookie gives a gooey center. | Melt caramel or use a store‑bought caramel sauce; swirl a small amount into the dough before baking. |\n| **Peanut‑butter swirl** | Adds a creamy, nutty center that pairs well with chocolate. | Drop a teaspoon of peanut butter into the dough and gently swirl with a skewer before baking. |\n| **Spice pinch (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom)** | Warm spices add depth and a subtle complexity. | Add ¼ tsp of your chosen spice to the dry mix. |\n| **Oat flour or almond flour** | Gives a slightly denser, more wholesome crumb. | Replace ¼–½ cup of all‑purpose flour with oat or almond flour. |\n| **Chocolate‑chip “double‑layer”** | More chocolate means more chocolate. | Fold in an extra cup of chips after the dough is mixed. |\n\n**Quick recipe tweak example**\n\n> **Chocolate‑Chip‑Salt‑Coffee Cookies**  \n> 1.

      "system_answer": "Here are some quick, practical tips to help you feel confident navigating Tokyo:\n\n| Topic | What to Do | Why It Helps |\n|-------|------------|--------------|\n| **Use an IC card (Suica / Pasmo)** | Buy a Suica (or Pasmo) at the airport or any JR/metro station. | It works on almost every train, subway, bus, and even some taxis. No need to buy individual tickets. |\n| **Download a transit app** | Google Maps, Citymapper, or the official **Tokyo Metro** app. | Real‑time schedules, route planners, and alerts for delays. |\n| **Know the major lines** | • **JR Yamanote** – loops central Tokyo (Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, etc.) <br>• **Tokyo Metro Ginza, Marunouchi, Hibiya, Chiyoda, Hanzomon, Tozai, Yurakucho, Namboku, Fukutoshin** | These cover most tourist spots. |\n| **Plan your route in advance** | Use the app to check the fastest route, transfer points, and walking distance. | Saves time and reduces the chance of getting lost. |\n| **Check station exits** | Each station has multiple exits; the one nearest your destination is usually best. | Avoid walking long distances after the train. |\n| **Watch the platform signs** | Look for “Tokyo Metro” vs. “JR” signs. | Helps you stay on the right line and avoid wrong platforms. |\n| **Use the “Tokyo Subway Ticket”** | 24‑, 48‑, or 72‑hour unlimited rides for subways only. | Great if you’ll be hopping on and off the subway frequently. |\n| **Be mindful of peak hours** | 7:30‑9:30 am and 5:00‑7:00 pm on weekdays. | Trains can be extremely crowded; consider traveling a bit earlier or later. |\n| **Carry a small map or offline guide** | Google Maps offline or a paper map of the area. | Useful if you lose signal or the app freezes. |\n| **Ask for help** | Japanese people are generally helpful. Say “すみません” (excuse me) and ask for directions. | Most will point you in the right direction or offer a quick explanation. |\n| **Keep your belongings secure** | Use a cross‑body bag, keep your phone in a front pocket, and stay aware of pickpockets. | Tokyo is safe, but crowded places can attract petty theft. |\n| **Plan for the first day** | Stick to a few key sights (e.g., Shibuya Crossing, Meiji Shrine, Shinjuku Gyoen). | Reduces overwhelm and lets you get a feel for the city. |\n| **Use the “Tokyo Metro 24‑hour ticket”** | If you’re staying in Shinjuku, you can get a 24‑hour ticket for the metro. | Unlimited rides for a day—great for exploring without worrying about fares. |\n| **Stay hydrated and rested** | Tokyo can be hot and busy. | Keeps you alert and ready to navigate. |\n\n**Quick sanity check before you leave the hotel:**\n\n1. **Check your Suica balance** – add a little extra just in case.  \n2. **Confirm your destination’s nearest station** – note the exit number.  \n3. **Set a reminder** to check the train schedule 10 minutes before you board.  \n\nWith these tools and a bit of planning, you’ll find Tokyo’s transit system surprisingly straightforward. Enjoy your trip!",

      "system_answer": "Here are some quick, practical tips to help you make the most of your bedroom makeover:\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why It Helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Clear the room** | Take everything out or at least move it to the center. | Gives you a blank canvas and lets you see the space’s true dimensions. |\n| **2. Map the floor plan** | Measure the room and draw a scaled floor plan (or use an online room‑planner). | Helps you visualize different layouts without moving furniture around repeatedly. |\n| **3. Decide the focal point** | Usually the bed, a window, or a piece of art. | All other furniture should support or complement this point. |\n| **4. Create zones** | Bed area, study/desk area, seating area, storage. | Keeps the room organized and functional. |\n| **5. Use the “rule of thirds”** | Place the bed or main piece on one of the three vertical lines in a 3×3 grid. | Creates a balanced, visually pleasing layout. |\n| **6. Keep traffic flow** | Leave at least 2–3 ft (60–90 cm) of clearance around furniture. | Prevents the room from feeling cramped and makes it easier to move. |\n| **7. Consider lighting** | Position lamps or lights so they’re not blocked by furniture. | Good lighting can change the mood and usability of the space. |\n| **8. Test with a “shadow”** | Place a cardboard cut‑out of a piece (e.g., a chair) to see how it fits. | Saves time and avoids moving heavy items unnecessarily. |\n| **9. Layer with rugs** | Add a rug under the bed or seating area to anchor the space. | Adds texture, warmth, and a sense of cohesion. |\n| **10. Add personal touches** | Hang art, display photos, or add plants after the layout is set. | Makes the space feel uniquely yours. |\n\n### Quick “Do‑It‑Now” Checklist\n\n1. **Measure** the room and each major piece of furniture.  \n2. **Draw** a floor plan on paper or use a free online tool (e.g., RoomSketcher, Planner 5D).  \n3. **Choose a focal point** (bed, window, artwork).  \n4. **Sketch a few layout options** on the plan.  \n5. **Pick the best one** and start moving furniture.  \n6. **Add rugs, lighting, and décor** after the furniture is in place.\n\n### Bonus: A Simple “Bedroom Layout” Idea\n\n| Area | Suggested Furniture | Placement |\n|------|---------------------|-----------|\n| **Bed** | Queen/Full bed | Center of the longest wall, opposite the door (if possible). |\n| **Nightstand** | 1–2 small tables | One on each side of the bed. |\n| **Desk/Study** | Small desk + chair | Near a window for natural light. |\n| **Seating** | Small sofa or armchair + side table | Opposite the desk or near a reading lamp. |\n| **Storage** | Wardrobe/closet + dresser | Along the wall opposite the bed or in a corner. |\n| **Rug** | Area rug under the bed + seating | Creates a cozy, defined zone. |\n\nFeel free to tweak the layout to fit your room’s shape and your personal style. Happy rearranging!",

      "system_answer": "It’s very possible that something in your living room is triggering your sneezing. Here are a few common culprits and what you can do about them:\n\n| Potential trigger | Why it matters | Quick fixes |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Dust & dust mites** | Dust accumulates on surfaces, in carpets, and in upholstery. Dust mites thrive in warm, humid environments and release allergens that can cause sneezing. | • Vacuum with a HEPA‑filter vacuum at least once a week.<br>• Wash bedding, curtains, and any removable cushions in hot water weekly.<br>• Consider a dust‑mite‑proof cover for pillows and mattresses. |\n| **Pet dander** | Cats (and other pets) shed skin flakes that are a major allergen. Even if you keep your pet out of the bedroom, dander can linger in the living room. | • Brush your cat regularly (outside or in a well‑ventilated area).<br>• Use a lint roller or a pet‑friendly vacuum attachment to remove hair from furniture.<br>• Keep pet bedding in a washable bag and wash it often. |\n| **Mold or mildew** | Damp spots, especially around windows, baseboards, or in the HVAC system, can grow mold that releases spores into the air. | • Inspect for visible mold and clean with a mixture of water and vinegar or a commercial mold cleaner.<br>• Use a dehumidifier if humidity is above 50 %.<br>• Ensure proper ventilation (open windows, use exhaust fans). |\n| **Allergenic plants or flowers** | Indoor plants can release pollen or mold spores, especially if they’re over‑watered. | • Keep plants in a well‑ventilated spot and avoid over‑watering.<br>• Consider low‑allergen plants like snake plant or spider plant (they’re also good air purifiers). |\n| **Air‑conditioning or heating filters** | A dirty filter can circulate dust and allergens throughout the room. | • Replace or clean HVAC filters every 1–3 months (or more often if you have pets).<br>• Consider a HEPA air purifier for the living room. |\n\n### Quick checklist for today\n1. **Vacuum** the living room floor and any upholstered furniture.  \n2. **Wipe** all surfaces with a damp microfiber cloth (this traps dust instead of blowing it around).  \n3. **Check** the HVAC filter and replace if it looks dirty.  \n4. **Open** a window for a few minutes to let fresh air in (if weather permits).  \n5. **Take a break** from the room for a bit—see if the sneezing eases when you’re elsewhere.\n\nIf you try these steps and your sneezing continues, it might be worth seeing a healthcare provider to rule out allergies or other respiratory issues. But most often, a little cleaning and better airflow can make a noticeable difference.",
