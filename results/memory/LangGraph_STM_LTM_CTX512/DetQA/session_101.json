      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Second wife of Brand\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, Mrs. Brand is identified as the spouse of Mr. Brand. The text explicitly states that she had a first husband who died in war and that her second husband was Hilary Martinchel, indicating that she is the second wife in the marital sequence. There is no evidence that she is a lawyer or that she represents an agency execution by a law firm, and the reference to “Valerie” is simply her name, not a title of a first wife. Therefore, the correct identification is that Mrs. Brand is the second wife of Brand.\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Inheriting through a valid will\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative explains that Mrs. Brand’s only surviving relative was her uncle in Canada, who left a substantial sum to her in his will. The Brand couple’s wealth came directly from that inheritance, not from a purchase, a transfer of property, or a forged identity. The letter addressed to Mrs. Brand was simply a formal notification of the will’s execution, and the couple’s acquisition of the funds was therefore through a legitimate, legally‑binding will.\"}",

Mr. and Mrs. Brand\nB. Miss Pema Khodro\nC. Mrs. Rival\nD. Mrs. Rumsfeld\n Output:",
      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Mr. and Mrs. Brand\",\"reasoning\":\"The letter from Inspector Hercule Poirot to Hercule Poirot states that the body found in the Brand family’s backyard was identified as Quentin Durgeslin (the victim referred to as Quentin Ducassin in the question). It further notes that the prosecutor believes an arrest warrant can be issued for Mrs. Brand, implying her direct involvement in the murder. No evidence in the narrative points to Miss Pema Khodro, Mrs. Rival, or Mrs. Rumsfeld as suspects. Therefore, the most supported conclusion is that the Brand couple—Mr. and Mrs. Brand—were responsible for Quentin Ducassin’s death.\"}",
