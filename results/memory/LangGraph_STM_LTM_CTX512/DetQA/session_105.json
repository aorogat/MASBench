      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Quinn has already identified the killer, but lacks evidence.\",\"reasoning\":\"Quinn’s plan was to lure Barry into using the same poison again by making him believe he was being blackmailed.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Probing the killer to see if they will return to the scene\",\"reasoning\":\"The Quinns’ return to the Roman Theater was driven by a tactical need to observe the environment for any signs that the murderer might re‑enter or leave the venue. By revisiting the scene, they could check for fresh footprints, new evidence, or any changes that would indicate the killer’s presence or intent to revisit.
