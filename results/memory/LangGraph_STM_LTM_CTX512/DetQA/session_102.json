      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Her sister Charlotte Blacklock\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative consistently identifies Letitia Blacklock as the hostess and her sister as Charlotte Blacklock. Throughout the text, Letitia is portrayed as the host of the gathering, while Charlotte is described as her sister who has a history of a thyroid operation and a distinctive scar. No evidence in the story suggests that Letitia is actually Sonya (Randall Goodle’s sister) or Randall Goodle’s niece. Therefore, the only plausible true identity for the hostess Letitia Blacklock is that she is indeed Charlotte Blacklock’s sister, i.e., Charlotte herself is the person behind the hostess’s persona.\"}",
