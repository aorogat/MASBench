      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Self-deprecation\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative does not provide any explicit description of a character named Higashide Shozo, but the name “Shozo” is commonly used in Japanese fiction for characters who are modest, modestly self‑aware, or exhibit a self‑deprecating attitude.  In the context of the investigation, no evidence suggests that he is ambitious, fragile, or particularly humble in a grand sense; rather, the absence of any dramatic or domineering actions implies a more subdued, self‑critical disposition.  Therefore, the most plausible characterization of Higashide Shozo, based on naming conventions and the lack of contrary evidence, is that he is self‑deprecating.\"}",
