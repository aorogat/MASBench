Hamnet Sedley\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative describes that after the bomb detonated in Dr. Allis’s (Dr. Alessi’s) house, a body was discovered in the cellar. Forensic examination identified the corpse as Dr. Hamnett Sedra, who is the twin brother of William Sedley (also known as William Schedler). The body’s physical features, the key found in the pocket, and the watch’s time all matched Dr. Sedra’s profile.
