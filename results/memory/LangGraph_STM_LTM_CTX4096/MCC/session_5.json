      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the heart‑rate range that you should aim for during aerobic exercise in order to achieve a specific training goal (e.g., improving cardiovascular fitness, burning fat, or training for a race).  \n\nIt’s usually expressed as a percentage of your *maximum heart rate* (MHR). The most common method to estimate MHR is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MHR} \\approx 220 - \\text{age}\n\\]\n\nTarget heart‑rate zones are then set as a percentage of that MHR:\n\n| Zone | % of MHR | Typical purpose |\n|------|----------|-----------------|\n| **Very light** | 50–60 % | Warm‑up, recovery |\n| **Light** | 60–70 % | Fat burning, general fitness |\n| **Moderate** | 70–80 % | Aerobic conditioning, endurance |\n| **Hard** | 80–90 % | Improving VO₂ max, high‑intensity training |\n| **Maximum** | 90–100 % | Sprinting, very short bursts |\n\nDuring exercise you monitor your heart rate (via a watch, chest strap, or pulse) and try to stay within the desired zone. This helps ensure you’re exercising at the right intensity for your goals while avoiding over‑ or under‑training.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Why it’s *yellow* | What’s really happening |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | The Sun actually emits almost *white* light (a mix of all visible wavelengths). As that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered by air molecules and dust. The longer‑wavelength yellow‑orange photons reach our eyes more directly, so the Sun appears yellow. |\n| **Human eye sensitivity** | Our eyes are most sensitive to green‑yellow light. When the Sun is high in the sky, the scattered blue light is reduced, so the yellow‑green part dominates our perception. |\n| **Altitude effect** | At sunrise or sunset the Sun’s light passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving a reddish‑orange hue. When the Sun is overhead, the path is shorter, less scattering, and the color is closer to white‑yellow. |\n| **Instrumental & cultural factors** | Many photographs and artistic depictions use a slightly yellow tint to emphasize warmth or to match the color of the Sun’s surface (the photosphere is about 5,800 K, which appears white‑yellow to the human eye). |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun itself is essentially white; it looks yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere preferentially scatters away the blue part of its spectrum, leaving the yellow‑orange wavelengths to dominate our view.",

There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 41 °C) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, inside the mouth, and on the teats (in cattle) <br>• Swelling of the feet and hooves (hence the name) <br>• Lameness, difficulty chewing, and reduced milk production. <br>• In young animals, the disease can be severe and may lead to death. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from decreased milk and meat production, trade restrictions, culling of infected animals, and costs of vaccination and biosecurity. Because of its high contagion, many countries impose strict quarantine and movement controls. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Vaccination (live or inactivated) is the main tool in endemic regions. <br>• Strict movement controls, quarantine, and culling of infected or exposed animals. <br>• Biosecurity measures: disinfectants, controlled access to farms, and proper disposal of carcasses. |\n| **Human health** | FMD is **not** transmissible to humans. Humans can become infected only by handling infected animals or contaminated products, but the virus does not cause disease in people. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the mouths and feet of livestock, leading to significant economic losses in the agriculture sector.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound, then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal, sonar can determine distance, size, shape, and sometimes material properties of the target.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Principle** | Sound travels through a medium (water, air, etc.). When it encounters an object, part of the wave reflects back. The sonar system sends a “ping” and records the echo. |\n| **Types** | • **Active sonar** – emits a pulse and listens for echoes (used for navigation, mapping, and object detection). <br>• **Passive sonar** – only listens for sounds produced by other objects (used for detecting ships, submarines, marine life). |\n| **Applications** | • **Naval** – submarine detection, mine detection, navigation. <br>• **Commercial** – fishing (to locate fish schools), underwater mapping, pipeline inspection. <br>• **Scientific** – oceanography, marine biology, seafloor mapping. |\n| **Key parameters** | • **Frequency** – higher frequencies give finer resolution but attenuate faster; lower frequencies travel farther but with less detail. <br>• **Range** – distance the sonar can effectively detect objects. <br>• **Beamwidth** – the angular spread of the transmitted sound; narrower beams give better directionality. |\n| **How it works** | 1. **Transmit**: A transducer emits a sound pulse. <br>2. **Propagation**: The pulse travels through water. <br>3. **Reflection**: It hits an object and reflects back. <br>4. **Receive**: The transducer (now acting as a receiver) picks up the echo. <br>5. **Processing**: The system calculates distance (time delay × speed of sound) and may analyze echo characteristics for identification. |\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where sight is limited.",

      "system_answer": "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain, tenderness, and a range of other symptoms. It’s not a single disease but a syndrome—meaning it’s a collection of signs and symptoms that tend to occur together.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain that affects both sides of the body and above and below the waist. It’s often described as a constant dull ache or “deep” pain. |\n| **Tender points** | 18 specific spots on the body (e.g., neck, shoulders, elbows, hips) that are especially sensitive to pressure. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. |\n| **Sleep problems** | Trouble falling or staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive issues** | Often called “fibro fog” – difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, depression or anxiety, numbness/tingling, and sometimes sensitivity to temperature or sound. |\n\n---\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n\n- **Exact cause unknown** – It’s thought to involve a combination of genetics, stress, infections, and abnormal pain processing in the brain and spinal cord.\n- **Risk factors**:  \n  - Women (especially 30‑50 yr old) are more often affected.  \n  - Family history of fibromyalgia or other chronic pain conditions.  \n  - History of physical or emotional trauma.  \n  - Certain infections (e.g., Lyme disease, mononucleosis).  \n\n---\n\n### Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical evaluation** – A doctor will look for the tender points and ask about pain patterns, sleep, and fatigue.  \n- **Exclusion** – Other conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease) are ruled out with blood tests or imaging.  \n- **Criteria** – The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a set of criteria that combine pain severity, tender point count, and symptom duration.\n\n---\n\n### Treatment\n\nThere’s no single cure, but a combination of approaches can help:\n\n| Approach | What it does |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Medications** | Pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin). |\n| **Exercise** | Low‑impact activities (walking, swimming, yoga) improve pain and sleep. |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening and stretching to reduce stiffness. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps manage pain perception and coping strategies. |\n| **Sleep hygiene** | Consistent bedtime routine, limiting caffeine/alcohol, and creating a dark, cool sleep environment. |\n| **Stress management** | Mindfulness, relaxation techniques, or biofeedback. |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Balanced diet, adequate hydration, and avoiding over‑exertion. |\n\n---\n\n### Living with Fibromyalgia\n\n- **Track symptoms** – A pain diary can help identify triggers (certain foods, stress, weather changes).  \n- **Set realistic goals** – Small, achievable steps in exercise or daily tasks reduce frustration.  \n- **Seek support** – Support groups, counseling, or online communities can provide emotional help.  \n- **Regular check‑ins** – Work with a rheumatologist or primary care provider to adjust treatment as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition that primarily causes widespread pain and fatigue. While the exact cause isn’t fully understood, a combination of medication, exercise, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. If you suspect you have fibromyalgia, a visit to a healthcare professional—ideally a rheumatologist—can start the diagnostic and treatment process.",

It is used to determine eligibility for benefits and services.\n- If you think you might meet the criteria, you can have a vision test performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. The results can be used to apply for disability benefits or to request accommodations.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nIn the U.S., a person is considered legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity in the better eye is 20/200 or worse, or their visual field is 20 degrees or less. The same thresholds (20/200 acuity or 20° field) are used in most other countries, sometimes expressed in metric units.",

      "system_answer": "A **prism** is a transparent optical element—usually made of glass or plastic—whose flat, polished surfaces refract (bend) light.  \n\n### Key features\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Shape** | Most common is a triangular prism (two triangular faces and three rectangular faces). The cross‑section is a triangle, but any polyhedron with two parallel faces (a “prism” in geometry) can be called a prism. |\n| **Material** | Typically glass (e.g., crown or flint glass) or high‑index plastic. |\n| **Refractive index** | Determines how much the light bends; higher‑index materials bend light more. |\n| **Surface quality** | Must be optically flat and polished to avoid scattering. |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Refraction** – When light enters a prism, it slows down and bends because the speed of light is lower in the prism material than in air.  \n2. **Dispersion** – Different wavelengths (colors) of light have slightly different refractive indices, so they bend by different amounts.  \n3. **Exit** – The light leaves the prism on the other side, often emerging at a different angle and, if the prism is a triangular shape, split into a spectrum.\n\n### Common uses\n\n| Use | Why a prism is handy |\n|-----|---------------------|\n| **Spectroscopy** | A prism disperses white light into its component colors, allowing measurement of wavelengths. |\n| **Beam steering** | In lasers or optical instruments, a prism can redirect a beam without moving mirrors. |\n| **Color separation** | In photography or art, prisms can separate colors for creative effects. |\n| **Optical instruments** | Telescopes, binoculars, and microscopes use prisms for image inversion or to fold optical paths. |\n\n### Quick example\n\nA classic demonstration: shine a flashlight through a triangular glass prism. The beam splits into a rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet—showing the prism’s ability to disperse light.\n\nIn short, a prism is a flat‑sided, transparent piece of material that bends and splits light, making it a fundamental tool in optics, science, and art.",

The most common type is a *peptic ulcer*, which occurs in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum).  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  What Happens in an Ulcer?\n\n| Step | What’s going on |\n|------|-----------------|\n| **Erosion of the lining** | The mucous layer that protects the tissue is damaged. |\n| **Exposure to acid or enzymes** | In the stomach/duodenum, gastric acid and digestive enzymes attack the exposed tissue. |\n| **Inflammation & pain** | The body’s immune response causes swelling and pain. |\n| **Healing or chronicity** | If the cause is removed, the ulcer can heal; otherwise it may persist or worsen. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Types of Ulcers\n\n| Type | Typical location | Common cause |\n|------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic (gastric/duodenal)** | Stomach or duodenum | *Helicobacter pylori* infection, NSAID use, stress, smoking |\n| **Gastric** | Stomach lining | Same as above, plus acid hypersecretion |\n| **Duodenal** | Upper small intestine | Same as above, often occurs in the first part of the duodenum |\n| **Pressure (bed‑sores)** | Skin over bony prominences | Prolonged pressure, immobility |\n| **Venous stasis** | Lower legs | Chronic venous insufficiency |\n| **Traumatic** | Any area | Injury or surgery |\n| **Burn** | Skin | Thermal, chemical, or radiation injury |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical ulcer |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Burning abdominal pain** | Peptic ulcer (often improves or worsens with food) |\n| **Heartburn / acid reflux** | Gastric ulcer |\n| **Nausea / vomiting** | Severe ulcers |\n| **Dark or black stool** | Bleeding ulcer |\n| **Painful skin lesions** | Pressure or venous ulcers |\n| **Redness, swelling, drainage** | Traumatic or burn ulcers |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Diagnosis\n\n1. **Medical history & physical exam**  \n2. **Upper endoscopy (EGD)** – visualizes the ulcer and allows biopsy.  \n3. **Helicobacter pylori testing** – breath, stool, or blood tests.  \n4. **Imaging** – X‑ray, CT, or MRI for deeper ulcers or complications.  \n5. **Lab tests** – CBC for anemia, coagulation studies if bleeding suspected.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Treatment\n\n| Goal | Typical approach |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Reduce acid** | Proton‑pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole) or H₂ blockers (ranitidine). |\n| **Eliminate H. pylori** | Triple therapy: two antibiotics + a PPI for 10–14 days. |\n| **Stop irritants** | Discontinue NSAIDs, avoid alcohol, reduce stress. |\n| **Support healing** | Antacids, sucralfate (protective coating). |\n| **Manage pain** | NSAIDs (if safe), acetaminophen, or stronger analgesics if needed. |\n| **Treat complications** | Endoscopic clipping or cautery for bleeding; surgery for perforation or obstruction. |\n| **Pressure ulcers** | Off‑loading devices, wound care, nutrition, infection control. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Prevention\n\n- **Avoid unnecessary NSAIDs** or use protective agents (e.g., PPI) if needed.  \n- **Treat H. pylori** promptly if diagnosed.  \n- **Manage stress** and maintain a healthy diet.  \n- **Use proper wound care** and reposition patients to prevent pressure ulcers.  \n- **Quit smoking** and limit alcohol intake.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAn ulcer is a break in the protective lining of a body surface, most commonly the stomach or duodenum, caused by acid, infection, or irritation.  It presents with pain, possible bleeding, and requires treatment that reduces acid, eliminates infection, and protects the tissue to allow healing.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **1. Start with a principal** | The initial amount you invest or borrow. |\n| **2. Earn interest for a period** | The interest is calculated on the principal. |\n| **3. Add the interest to the principal** | The new total (principal + interest) becomes the new base. |\n| **4. Repeat** | Interest is calculated on this larger base in the next period. |\n\nBecause the base grows each period, the amount of interest earned in later periods is larger than in earlier ones.\n\n---\n\n### Formula\n\nFor a principal \\(P\\), annual interest rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal), and \\(n\\) compounding periods per year, the amount \\(A\\) after \\(t\\) years is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(P\\)** – initial principal  \n- **\\(r\\)** – annual nominal interest rate (e.g., 5 % → 0.05)  \n- **\\(n\\)** – number of times interest is compounded per year (e.g., 12 for monthly)  \n- **\\(t\\)** – number of years  \n\nIf interest is compounded **continuously**, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = P\\,e^{rt}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(e\\) is the base of natural logarithms (~2.71828).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you invest \\$1,000 at an annual rate of 6 % compounded quarterly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)  \n- \\(r = 0.06\\)  \n- \\(n = 4\\)  \n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 3}\n  = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + 0.015\\right)^{12}\n  = 1{,}000 \\times 1.195618\n  \\approx \\$1{,}195.62\n\\]\n\nSo you earn about \\$195.62 in interest over 3 years.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Investments**: Compound interest turns modest savings into substantial wealth over time.  \n- **Loans**: For borrowers, compound interest can increase the total amount owed if payments are delayed.  \n- **Financial planning**: Understanding compounding helps you compare savings accounts, CDs, bonds, and loans.\n\n---\n\n### Key take‑aways\n\n1. **Interest on interest** – each period’s interest is added to the principal, so subsequent interest is calculated on a larger amount.  \n2. **Frequency matters** – the more often interest is compounded (daily, monthly, quarterly), the greater the final amount.  \n3. **Time is a powerful factor** – even a small rate can grow significantly over many years.  \n\nCompound interest is the engine behind the “time value of money” concept and is central to both investing and borrowing.",

Why Hybridization Is Needed\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have fixed shapes and energies.  \n- In many molecules, the observed bond angles (e.g., 109.5°, 120°, 180°) don’t match the geometry of a single s or p orbital.  \n- By *mixing* orbitals, we create new orbitals that are **sp³‑like, sp²‑like, etc.**—each pointing in directions that match the observed geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The Basic Hybrid Orbitals\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals mixed | Number of hybrid orbitals | Shape & bond angle | Typical example |\n|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | 4 | Tetrahedral, 109.5° | CH₄, NH₃, H₂O (with lone pairs) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | 3 | Trigonal planar, 120° | C₂H₄ (ethylene), BF₃ |\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | 2 | Linear, 180° | C₂H₂ (acetylene) |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal, 90°/120° | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | 6 | Octahedral, 90° | SF₆ |\n\n*Note:* The “d” orbitals are only used when the central atom is in the third period or higher.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How Hybridization Works (Simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count the *electron‑pair groups* (bonding pairs + lone pairs).  \n2. **Choose the hybridization** that gives the right number of hybrid orbitals.  \n3. **Form bonds** by overlapping each hybrid orbital with a suitable orbital from a neighboring atom.  \n4. **Resulting geometry** matches the observed shape.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons: 2 s + 2 p.  \n- To form 4 C–H σ bonds, carbon uses **sp³ hybrid orbitals** (4 hybrids).  \n- Each hybrid points toward a corner of a tetrahedron → 109.5° bond angles.  \n- The molecule is perfectly tetrahedral.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Hybridization in Other Contexts (Brief)\n\n| Field | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Genetics** | Crossing of two different species or varieties to produce a hybrid. |\n| **Linguistics** | Mixing of two languages or dialects (code‑mixing). |\n| **Physics** | Mixing of quantum states (e.g., electron‑hole hybridization). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a conceptual tool that lets chemists explain and predict the shapes of molecules by combining atomic orbitals into new, directionally‑oriented hybrid orbitals. It’s the reason why methane is tetrahedral, ethylene is planar, and many other molecules have the geometries they do.",

      "system_answer": "**Refrigerator temperature recommendation**\n\n| Compartment | Ideal temperature | Why it matters |\n|-------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Refrigerator (fresh‑food section)** | **0 °F to 32 °F (‑18 °C to 0 °C)** | Keeps perishable foods (dairy, meats, produce) safe and slows bacterial growth. |\n| **Freezer** | **0 °F (‑18 °C)** | Keeps food frozen solid; prevents spoilage and maintains texture. |\n\n### Practical tips\n\n1. **Use a thermometer** – Most built‑in fridge thermometers are inaccurate; a separate digital thermometer gives a reliable reading.  \n2. **Check the range** – If the fridge is too warm (above 32 °F), food may spoil quickly; if too cold (below 0 °F), you risk freezer burn and energy waste.  \n3. **Keep it steady** – Avoid frequent door opening, and keep the fridge well‑organized so air can circulate.  \n4. **Adjust for climate** – In very hot or humid environments, you might need to set the fridge a few degrees lower to compensate for heat gain.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Aim for **0 °F to 32 °F (‑18 °C to 0 °C)** in the refrigerator and **0 °F (‑18 °C)** in the freezer. This keeps food safe, preserves quality, and is energy‑efficient.",

It is caused by the **polio virus (poliovirus)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family.  \n\n---\n\n## How it spreads\n- **Fecal‑oral route**: The virus is shed in the stool of infected people and can contaminate food, water, or surfaces.  \n- **Oral‑oral route**: Direct contact with saliva or respiratory secretions can also transmit the virus.  \n- **Rarely**: Airborne spread is not a major route.\n\n---\n\n## Clinical course\n| Stage | What happens | Typical symptoms |\n|-------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (can be up to 4 weeks) | Usually none |\n| **Prodromal (early)** | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild headache | Low‑grade fever, malaise, sore throat, sometimes a mild cough |\n| **Paralytic** | Virus invades the spinal cord and brainstem | Sudden flaccid paralysis (often asymmetric), loss of reflexes, muscle weakness, respiratory difficulty if the diaphragm is affected |\n| **Recovery** | Some regain function; others may have permanent paralysis | Variable; some recover fully, others may have residual weakness or paralysis |\n\n- **Non‑paralytic polio**: Most infections (≈ 90–95 %) are asymptomatic or cause only mild flu‑like illness.  \n- **Paralytic polio**: About 1 % of infections lead to paralysis; the rest are mild.\n\n---\n\n## Prevention\n- **Vaccination** is the cornerstone of polio control. Two main vaccines are used worldwide:\n  1. **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)** – injected, used in the U.S. and many other countries.\n  2. **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** – contains live attenuated virus, used in many low‑resource settings and in mass‑campaigns.\n\n- **Hygiene**: Handwashing, safe drinking water, and sanitation reduce transmission.\n\n---\n\n## Global status\n- **Eradication effort**: Since the 1980s, global polio incidence has dropped by > 99 %.  \n- **Endemic countries**: As of 2023, polio remains endemic only in a few countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Pakistan).  \n- **Outbreaks**: Occur when vaccination coverage drops or OPV strains revert to virulence (rare).\n\n---\n\n## Key take‑away\nPoliomyelitis is a viral disease that can cause sudden paralysis by attacking motor neurons.

The exact amount is usually specified in the employment contract, company policy, or a severance agreement. |\n| **Legal status** | Not required by federal law in the U.S. (except in certain cases, e.g., the WARN Act for large layoffs). Many states, countries, or collective bargaining agreements mandate severance or provide guidelines. |\n| **Tax treatment** | In most jurisdictions, severance pay is treated as ordinary income and is subject to withholding and payroll taxes. |\n| **Negotiation** | Employees can negotiate severance terms during a layoff or termination discussion. It’s common to ask for a longer payout period, continued benefits, or a reference letter. |\n| **Common triggers** | • Company downsizing or restructuring<br>• Plant or office closure<br>• Mergers/acquisitions<br>• Performance‑related termination (though often less generous) |\n\n### Example\n\nAn employee who has worked for a company for 10 years might receive a severance package equal to 2 weeks of pay for each year of service, plus 3 months of continued health insurance.

Their electrical properties can be precisely controlled, which makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | In a semiconductor, the valence band (filled with electrons) is separated from the conduction band (where electrons can move freely) by a small energy gap (≈ 0.1–4 eV). This gap can be bridged by thermal energy, light, or an applied voltage. |\n| **Doping** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (dopants) introduces extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type). This changes the material’s conductivity in a predictable way. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs) have a crystalline lattice that allows electrons to move in well‑defined paths, enabling high‑speed devices. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Integrated circuits, solar cells, power devices | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑frequency RF, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 2.3–3.3 |\n| **Gallium nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power amplifiers, RF | 3.4 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) | Key semiconductor feature |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction allows current one way | p‑type + n‑type doping |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Controls current flow with a small gate/base signal | Field‑effect control, high‑speed switching |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Many transistors on one chip | Precise doping, lithography |\n| **Solar cell** | Photons excite electrons across band gap | Light‑absorbing band gap |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting light | Direct band gap (GaAs, GaN) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why semiconductors matter\n\n- **Miniaturization**: Tiny transistors (nanometers wide) allow billions of logic gates on a single chip.  \n- **Energy efficiency**: Low‑power switching reduces heat and energy consumption.  \n- **Versatility**: From microprocessors to sensors, power supplies to LEDs, semiconductors are everywhere.  \n- **Innovation driver**: Advances in semiconductor technology (e.g., Moore’s Law, 3‑D stacking, new materials) enable faster, smaller, and cheaper electronics.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity can be finely tuned by doping and external stimuli. This controllability allows them to form the core components of virtually all modern electronic devices—from smartphones and computers to solar panels and LED lighting.",

      "question": "What is mold ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called *hyphae*. When these hyphae branch and spread, they form a network that can be seen as a fuzzy or powdery patch on surfaces.  \n\n### Key characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Growth form** | Hyphae → mycelium (the visible “body” of the mold). |\n| **Reproduction** | Produces spores (tiny, lightweight cells) that can be carried by air, water, or contact. |\n| **Habitat** | Needs moisture, organic material, and a suitable temperature (typically 20–30 °C). Common in kitchens, bathrooms, basements, and any damp area. |\n| **Appearance** | Often green, black, white, or blue‑green; can be fuzzy, powdery, or slimy. |\n| **Health impact** | Some molds release allergens, irritants, or mycotoxins that can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions, or more serious illnesses in sensitive individuals. |\n| **Damage** | Can degrade building materials (wood, drywall, insulation) and food products. |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Indoor air quality**: Mold spores in the air can trigger asthma, allergies, or infections.  \n- **Structural integrity**: Prolonged exposure can weaken wood, drywall, and other building components.  \n- **Food safety**: Moldy food can be unsafe to eat, especially if it produces toxins.  \n\n### Prevention & control\n\n1. **Control moisture**: Fix leaks, use dehumidifiers, ventilate bathrooms/kitchens.  \n2. **Clean promptly**: Remove visible mold with soap and water or a mold‑removal solution.  \n3. **Dispose of heavily infested items**: Some materials (carpet, drywall) may need to be replaced.  \n4. **Use protective gear**: Gloves, mask, and eye protection when cleaning mold.  \n5. **Professional help**: For large infestations or when mold is hidden behind walls or in HVAC systems.  \n\nIn short, mold is a fungus that thrives in damp, organic environments, spreads via spores, and can cause health and structural problems if not managed.",

      "question": "What does `` Sitting Shiva '' mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sitting Shiva** is a Jewish mourning practice that involves a period of close‑family mourning lasting **seven days** after a death. The term comes from the Hebrew word *shivá* (שִׁבְעָה), meaning “seven.”  \n\n### Key aspects\n\n| Element | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Duration** | 7 consecutive days, starting the day after the funeral or burial. |\n| **Location** | Usually at the home of the deceased or a close relative. |\n| **Participants** | Family members, close friends, and community members who come to offer condolences. |\n| **Activities** | • **Sitting** – mourners sit in a low‑profile setting, often on the floor or on low chairs. <br>• **Prayers** – the *Kaddish* (a prayer for the dead) is recited daily. <br>• **Silence** – a respectful quiet is maintained; speaking is limited to brief condolences. <br>• **Food** – mourners may eat simple, comforting foods; sometimes a meal is shared with visitors. |\n| **Purpose** | • To honor the deceased’s memory. <br>• To provide a structured time for grief and support. <br>• To allow the community to express sympathy and help the family. |\n\n### Cultural context\n\n- **Not a religious obligation** in the sense of a commandment, but a long‑standing custom in most Jewish communities.  \n- The practice can vary: some families keep the house closed to visitors, others allow a few close friends to come.  \n- After the seven days, the mourning period is considered complete, though other rituals (e.g., *yahrzeit* on the anniversary of death) continue.\n\nIn short, “sitting shiva” is the Jewish tradition of a seven‑day mourning period where family and friends gather to honor the dead, pray, and support one another.",

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion** that accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, “mushy” texture (hence the name “spongiform”).\n\n### How it works\n- **Prions** are tiny, protein‑only infectious agents that can convert normal prion proteins in the brain into the abnormal form.\n- The abnormal proteins build up, damaging brain tissue and causing the characteristic spongy appearance.\n- The disease progresses slowly; symptoms appear after a long incubation period (often 2–4 years in cattle).\n\n### Symptoms in cattle\n- Loss of coordination (ataxia)\n- Stiffness, tremors, and difficulty walking\n- Behavioral changes (aggression, irritability)\n- Weight loss and decreased appetite\n- Eventually, the animal becomes severely disabled and dies.\n\n### Transmission\n- **Feed contamination**: The most common route in the 1980s–1990s was feeding cattle processed animal protein (including infected brain or spinal tissue) in their feed. This practice was banned in many countries.\n- **Natural spread**: Infected animals can transmit the disease to other cattle through bodily fluids, but this is less common.\n\n### Human connection\n- **Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD)**: Humans can contract a related prion disease by eating infected beef products. vCJD is rare but fatal, with symptoms such as dementia, muscle stiffness, and loss of coordination.\n- **Public health measures**: Strict regulations on cattle feed, slaughtering, and beef processing have dramatically reduced BSE cases and vCJD risk.\n\n### Global impact\n- The BSE outbreak in the 1980s–1990s caused widespread economic loss in the beef industry and led to major changes in animal husbandry and food safety regulations worldwide.\n- Today, BSE cases are extremely rare in most countries, thanks to rigorous surveillance and control programs.\n\n### Bottom line\nMad cow disease is a prion‑based, fatal brain disorder in cattle that can, in rare cases, be transmitted to humans through contaminated beef. It is a key example of how a protein alone can act as an infectious agent and how public health measures can curb a serious animal and human health threat.",

      "question": "What is natural gas composed of ?",
      "system_answer": "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is mainly a mixture of hydrocarbons, with the exact proportions varying by field, but the typical composition is:\n\n| Component | Typical range (by volume) | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; gives natural gas its low‑density, high‑energy‑content character. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | Often used as a feedstock for petrochemicals. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Adds heating value; sometimes separated for use as LPG. |\n| **Butane (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Also used as LPG; contributes to higher calorific value. |\n| **Pentane & heavier hydrocarbons** | < 1 % | Minor constituents; can be removed to meet pipeline specifications. |\n| **Inert gases** (neon, helium, argon, krypton, xenon) | < 1 % | Trace amounts; usually negligible. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0 – 5 % | Often present as a contaminant; removed in processing. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0 – 5 % | Can be present; removed to meet pipeline standards. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.1 % | Toxic; must be removed for safety. |\n| **Water vapor** | Variable | Condensed water is removed during processing. |\n\n### Key points\n\n- **Methane** is the core component, providing the bulk of the energy content (≈ 55 MJ/m³).  \n- The heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane) are often separated and sold as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  \n- Inert gases and contaminants (nitrogen, CO₂, H₂S, water) are removed during natural‑gas processing to meet pipeline and end‑use specifications.  \n- The exact mix depends on the geological source (e.g., Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Middle East fields) and the processing steps applied.\n\nIn short, natural gas is primarily methane with small amounts of other hydrocarbons and trace gases, all of which are processed to produce a clean, high‑energy fuel for heating, electricity, and industrial use.",
