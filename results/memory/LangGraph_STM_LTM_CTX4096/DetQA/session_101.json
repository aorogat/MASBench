      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Second wife of Brand\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, Mr. Brand is married to Valerie, who is referred to as his wife throughout the investigation. The letter from Hercule Poirot clarifies that Mrs. Brand had a first husband who died in war, and after his death she married Mr. Brand, making her his second wife. No evidence in the text identifies her as a lawyer or as an agency executor, and the option about a first wife named Valerie is incorrect because Valerie is the second wife. Therefore, Mrs. Brand is best described as the second wife of Brand.\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Inheriting through a valid will\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative states that Mrs. Brand received a large sum of money from her uncle in Canada, who was her only surviving relative. This transfer of wealth is described as an inheritance, implying it was passed to her through a legitimate will or testamentary provision rather than a fraudulent identity, a transfer of property, or a purchase. No evidence in the text suggests that the Brandt couple obtained the money by falsifying documents or buying it, so the most accurate description is that they inherited it via a valid will.\"}",
