The symbols in the envelope contain important information.\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the envelope found in Dr. Alessi’s office bore the heading “Saxony Library” and a set of upside‑down symbols that, when read correctly, revealed the hidden message “Wm SHe.” This indicates that the envelope’s purpose was to conceal crucial information rather than simply hold money or evidence.
