      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Put the dish in the room\",\"reasoning\":\"According to the narrative, the evening tea was specifically ordered for Room 317 and was delivered there at 7:15 pm by the hotel staff. The three victims were present in that room, but the text indicates they did not actually consume the tea (the cups remained in the room after the incident). Thus the tea was simply placed in the room and left there, rather than being eaten by anyone or abandoned elsewhere. Therefore the correct answer is that the tea was put in the room.\"}",

To conceal suicide\nB. Beneficial to the body\nC. The murderer fled in the car that he drove\nD. Let the room look cluttered\n Output:",
      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Beneficial to the body\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, Poirot notes that the window in Room 238 was left open while the other two rooms had closed windows. He speculates that the killer did not close it to maintain consistency, and that Richard Nigges himself may have opened it. The most plausible motive for a victim to open a window after death is to allow fresh air or a breeze, which would be beneficial to the body’s post‑mortem condition. The other options (concealing suicide, the murderer fleeing in a car, or making the room look cluttered) are not supported by the text. Therefore, the opening of the window is best explained as being beneficial to the body’s environment after death. \"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Suicide due to guilt and suffering\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative repeatedly states that Patrick Yves, after learning of Nancy’s affair and the subsequent death of his wife Frances, could no longer bear the weight of his conscience. He realized he had betrayed Frances and, overwhelmed by guilt and suffering, chose to end his own life. No other cause of death—beating, poisoning, or a mysterious amanitin plot—is mentioned for Patrick. Therefore, the only consistent explanation for his death is suicide driven by guilt and suffering.\"}",
