      "system_answer": "Here are a handful of quick, “extra‑special” tweaks that can turn an ordinary chocolate‑chip cookie into something memorable:\n\n| What to add | Why it works | How to do it |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Espresso powder** | Intensifies the chocolate flavor without adding coffee taste | Stir 1 tsp into the dry ingredients (or ½ tsp if you’re sensitive to bitterness) |\n| **Sea salt** | A touch of salt balances sweetness and brings out the chocolate | Sprinkle a pinch on top of each cookie *before* baking, or add ¼ tsp to the dough |\n| **Brown butter** | Adds nutty, caramel notes | Melt butter until it turns golden brown, cool slightly, then use it in place of regular butter |\n| **Nuts** (walnuts, pecans, or almonds) | Adds crunch and a subtle earthy flavor | Roughly chop ½ cup and fold in with the chocolate chips |\n| **Chocolate chips + chunks** | Gives a mix of melt‑in‑your‑mouth and bite‑size chocolate | Use ½ cup chips + ½ cup chunks (or a mix of dark, milk, and white) |\n| **Dried fruit** (cranberries, cherries, or raisins) | Adds chewiness and a hint of tartness | Toss ¼ cup dried fruit with the chocolate chips |\n| **Spice** (cinnamon, nutmeg, or a pinch of cayenne) | Adds warmth or a subtle kick | Add ¼ tsp of your chosen spice to the dry mix |\n| **Peanut butter swirl** | Gives a creamy, nutty center | Drop a teaspoon of peanut butter in the center of each cookie before baking, then swirl with a toothpick |\n| **Bourbon or vanilla extract** | Adds depth and aroma | Replace 1 tsp vanilla with 1 tsp bourbon, or add an extra ½ tsp vanilla |\n| **Caramel drizzle** | Sweet, buttery finish | Melt caramel and drizzle over cooled cookies, or swirl into the dough before baking |\n\n**Pro tip:** If you’re using a new ingredient (e.g., espresso powder or nuts), start with a small batch to test the flavor balance. Once you’re happy, scale up for the party.\n\nHappy baking—and may your cookies be extra‑delicious!",

      "system_answer": "Getting around Tokyo can feel a bit intimidating at first, but once you know a few tricks it becomes almost second nature. Here’s a quick “starter kit” to help you feel confident and relaxed while you explore the city:\n\n| Topic | What to Do | Why It Helps |\n|-------|------------|--------------|\n| **Get an IC card (Suica / Pasmo)** | Pick one up at the airport or any JR station. | It works on trains, subways, buses, and even some taxis. No need to buy individual tickets each time. |\n| **Download a transit app** | Google Maps, Citymapper, or the official **Tokyo Metro** app. | Real‑time train schedules, platform changes, and walking directions. |\n| **Learn the basics of the subway map** | Focus on the 4 main lines that run through Shinjuku: Yamanote (JR), Ginza (Tokyo Metro), Marunouchi (Tokyo Metro), and Hanzomon (Tokyo Metro). | Shinjuku is a major hub; most destinations are just a few stops away. |\n| **Use the “Tokyo Subway Ticket”** | 24‑, 48‑, or 72‑hour unlimited passes. | Great if you plan to hop on and off trains frequently. |\n| **Plan for peak hours** | Trains are crowded 7:30‑9:30 am and 5:00‑7:00 pm. | If you can, travel a bit earlier or later to avoid the crush. |\n| **Keep a small cash stash** | Some small shops, vending machines, and taxis only take cash. | Suica is handy, but a few hundred yen in cash is useful. |\n| **Use the “Tokyo Metro” station signs** | They’re in English, Japanese, and sometimes Chinese. | Even if you’re lost, the signs guide you to exits, elevators, and platform numbers. |\n| **Ask for help** | Most station staff speak basic English. | They’re happy to point you in the right direction. |\n| **Stay aware of your belongings** | Pickpocketing is rare but can happen in crowded places. | Keep your wallet in a front pocket or a small, secure bag. |\n| **Try a “Tokyo Travel Guide” app** | Like “Tokyo Official Guide” or “Japan Official Travel App.” | It offers offline maps, recommended routes, and tourist info. |\n| **Use the “Tokyo Metro” “Station Information” kiosk** | They’re located at major stations. | You can print a route map or ask for a paper timetable. |\n| **Take advantage of the “Tokyo Metro” “Station Exit” signs** | They’re clearly marked and often have English translations. | Helps you find the right exit for your hotel or destination. |\n| **Plan a “back‑up” route** | If you’re heading to a museum, know an alternate station or bus line. | Reduces stress if a train is delayed or a platform is closed. |\n| **Use the “Tokyo Metro” “Station Map”** | Many stations have a large map of the surrounding area. | Good for spotting nearby restaurants, ATMs, and shops. |\n| **Check the “Tokyo Metro” “Station Guide” PDF** | Available online for each station. | Handy for offline reference if you lose internet. |\n| **Stay hydrated** | Tokyo’s trains can be hot in summer. | Keep a small water bottle in your bag. |\n| **Enjoy the scenery** | Some lines (e.g., the Yamanote) offer great city views. | Makes the commute feel like part of the adventure. |\n\n### Quick “Day‑in‑the‑Life” Example\n\n1. **Morning** – Grab a coffee at your hotel, tap your Suica on the gate, and head to Shinjuku Station.  \n2. **Mid‑morning** – Take the Yamanote Line to Shibuya (just 2 stops).  \n3. **Lunch** – Walk to the famous Shibuya Crossing, then hop on the Ginza Line to Ginza for a sushi lunch.  \n4. **Afternoon** – Use the Tokyo Metro app to find the nearest station to your museum, then walk or take a short train ride.  \n5. **Evening** – Return to Shinjuku via the same Yamanote Line, or if you’re tired, catch a taxi (just tap your Suica on the taxi meter).  \n\n### Final Tips\n\n- **Keep a small notebook or note on your phone** with the station names and the lines you’ll use.  \n- **Check the weather** before you head out; some lines have open platforms in summer.  \n- **Use the “Tokyo Metro” “Station Information” kiosk** if you’re ever unsure—staff there are friendly and helpful.  \n\nWith these tools and a bit of practice, you’ll find Tokyo’s transit system is actually one of the most efficient and user‑friendly in the world.

      "system_answer": "Here’s a quick, step‑by‑step guide to help you give your bedroom a fresh look without a full renovation:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Start with a Clean Slate**\n- **Clear the room**: Take everything out or at least move it to the center.  \n- **Declutter**: Toss or donate items you no longer use.  \n- **Clean**: Vacuum, dust, and wipe down surfaces. A clean room feels instantly more spacious.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Define Your Focal Point**\n- **Bed**: Usually the centerpiece. Decide whether you want it centered, against a wall, or angled.  \n- **Other focal points**: A statement piece of art, a window with a view, or a built‑in wardrobe.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Map Out Traffic Flow**\n- **Measure**: Get the room’s dimensions and the size of each piece of furniture.  \n- **Sketch a floor plan** (paper or a free online tool like RoomSketcher or Planner 5D).  \n- **Leave space**: Aim for at least 18–24 inches of clearance around the bed and between furniture to keep the room feeling open.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Choose a Layout Style**\n| Style | How it feels | Typical layout |\n|-------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Symmetrical** | Balanced, formal | Bed centered, matching side tables |\n| **Asymmetrical** | Modern, dynamic | Bed off‑center, varied furniture shapes |\n| **Zoning** | Functional | Separate sleeping area, workspace, or reading nook |\n| **Minimalist** | Calm, uncluttered | Few pieces, lots of open space |\n\nPick the one that matches your vibe and the room’s size.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Play with Furniture Placement**\n- **Bed**:  \n  - *Against the wall*: Keeps the room feeling open.  \n  - *Centered*: Creates a cozy, symmetrical feel.  \n  - *Against a window*: Lets natural light highlight the bed.  \n- **Nightstands**:  \n  - Keep them at equal distance from the bed for symmetry.  \n  - If you’re short on space, consider floating shelves or a small side table.  \n- **Desk/Workspace**:  \n  - Position it near a window for natural light.  \n  - If you’re a night owl, place it on the opposite side of the bed to avoid glare on your screen.  \n- **Storage**:  \n  - Use built‑in wardrobes or a freestanding armoire.  \n  - Add a dresser or chest of drawers for extra surface area.  \n- **Seating**:  \n  - A small chair or a comfy bean‑bag can create a reading nook.  \n  - If space is tight, a wall‑mounted fold‑away chair works well.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Consider Lighting**\n- **Layered lighting**: Combine overhead, task, and accent lights.  \n- **Bedside lamps**: Choose a style that complements the room’s décor.  \n- **Accent lighting**: LED strips behind the headboard or under a shelf can add a modern touch.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Add Texture & Color**\n- **Rug**: Anchor the bed and add warmth.  \n- **Throw pillows & blankets**: Mix patterns and textures for visual interest.  \n- **Wall color**: Light neutrals open up the space; a bold accent wall can add personality.\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Fine‑Tuning**\n- **Test the layout**: Walk around the room to see how it feels.  \n- **Adjust**: Move a piece or two if something feels off.  \n- **Add personal touches**: Photos, artwork, or plants to make the space uniquely yours.\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Optional: Use a Room Planner App**\n- **RoomSketcher** (free version)  \n- **Planner 5D**  \n- **MagicPlan** (for iOS/Android)  \n\nThese tools let you drag and drop furniture, experiment with colors, and even view the room in 3D.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist for the Weekend\n\n| Task | Time |\n|------|------|\n| Clear & declutter | 1–2 hrs |\n| Measure room & furniture | 30 min |\n| Sketch layout | 30 min |\n| Move furniture & test | 1–2 hrs |\n| Add lighting & décor | 30 min |\n| Final touches | 30 min |\n\n---\n\n**Pro tip:** If you’re unsure about a layout, start by placing the bed first and then build around it. Once the bed is in place, the rest of the furniture will naturally find its spot.\n\nEnjoy the process—rearranging can feel like a mini‑renovation and it’s a great way to refresh your space! If you need help visualizing a specific layout or picking out décor, just let me know. Happy redecorating!",

      "system_answer": "It’s very possible that something in your living room is triggering your sneezing. Here are the most common culprits and what you can do to pinpoint and fix the problem:\n\n| Potential Trigger | Why it matters | Quick check / fix |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Dust & cobwebs** | Dust mites and dead skin cells are classic allergens. | Vacuum the floor, rugs, and upholstery with a HEPA‑filter vacuum. Clean surfaces with a damp microfiber cloth. |\n| **Pet dander** | Even if you’re not allergic to the animal itself, the dander can linger on furniture and fabrics. | Brush your pet regularly, wash bedding, and consider a HEPA air purifier. |\n| **Mold or mildew** | Damp corners, windowsills, or hidden leaks can grow mold, which releases spores into the air. | Inspect for water stains, check the HVAC return, and use a dehumidifier if humidity > 50 %. |\n| **Cleaning products / air fresheners** | Strong fragrances or chemicals can irritate the nasal passages. | Switch to fragrance‑free or natural cleaners, and keep the room well‑ventilated after use. |\n| **New paint or wallpaper** | Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can linger for weeks. | Open windows, use a fan, or consider a low‑VOC paint if you’re repainting. |\n| **Air‑conditioning / heating filters** | Clogged filters trap allergens and circulate them. | Replace or clean the filter every 1–3 months. |\n| **Seasonal pollen** | Even indoors, pollen can drift in through open windows or on clothing. | Keep windows closed on high‑pollen days and wash clothes before entering. |\n\n### Quick diagnostic steps\n\n1. **Take a “clean‑room” test**  \n   - Move all non‑essential items out of the living room.  \n   - Vacuum and wipe down everything.  \n   - Leave the room closed for a day, then return and see if sneezing improves.\n\n2. **Track the timing**  \n   - Note when sneezing spikes (morning, after cleaning, after pets, etc.).  \n   - This can point to a specific trigger (e.g., after vacuuming or after your cat returns from outside).\n\n3. **Check the air quality**  \n   - If you have a smart thermostat or air‑quality monitor, look at the particulate count.  \n   - A spike in PM2.5 or dust levels often correlates with sneezing.\n\n4. **Consider a quick allergy test**  \n   - Over‑the‑counter allergy kits can identify common indoor allergens (dust mites, pet dander, mold).  \n   - If you’re still unsure, a visit to an allergist can pinpoint the exact cause.\n\n### What to do next\n\n- **If dust is the culprit**: Vacuum with a HEPA filter, use a damp cloth for surfaces, and consider a high‑efficiency air purifier.\n- **If pet dander is the culprit**: Brush your pet daily, wash bedding, and keep the living room off‑limits to the pet if possible.\n- **If mold is suspected**: Inspect for leaks, use a dehumidifier, and consider professional mold remediation if the problem is extensive.\n- **If cleaning products are the issue**: Switch to fragrance‑free or natural cleaners, and ventilate the room after use.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Yes, your living room can definitely be the source of your sneezing. Start with a thorough clean and a quick “clean‑room” test, then narrow down the culprit using the steps above. If the sneezing persists after addressing these factors, it might be worth consulting an allergist to rule out other allergies or conditions.",
