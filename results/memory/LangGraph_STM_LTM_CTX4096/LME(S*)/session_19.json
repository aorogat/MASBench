      "system_answer": "Here’s a quick “shopping‑checklist” you can run through at the store so you’ll walk out with a guitar that feels right and sounds great:\n\n| What to Check | Why It Matters | How to Test It |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Body shape & size** | Comfort is key—if it’s too big or too small you’ll get sore shoulders or a cramped feel. | Hold the guitar in the way you’ll play it (standing, sitting, with a strap). Does it sit comfortably on your chest/shoulders? |\n| **Weight** | A heavier guitar can be more resonant, but if it’s too heavy you’ll fatigue quickly. | Pick it up and feel the balance. A good rule of thumb: < 9 lb for a solid‑body, < 6 lb for a hollow‑body. |\n| **Neck profile & scale length** | A neck that’s too thick or too thin can make fretting painful; scale length affects string tension and tone. | Run your fingers along the fretboard. Does the neck feel natural? Try a few chords or scales to see if the action (string height) feels right. |\n| **Action & intonation** | Low action makes it easier to play, but too low can cause buzz. Good intonation means the guitar stays in tune up the neck. | Use a tuner to check the 12th‑fret note. If it’s sharp or flat, the guitar may need a setup. |\n| **Pick‑up type & placement** | Single‑coils give bright, crisp tones; humbuckers give warmer, thicker sound. Placement (neck vs. bridge) changes the balance. | Plug in and play a few chords. Does the sound match the style you want? |\n| **Controls** | Volume & tone knobs should be smooth and responsive. Some guitars have a master volume or a separate tone for each pickup. | Turn the knobs while playing. Do you get a clear change in tone? |\n| **Hardware quality** | Tight tuning machines, a sturdy bridge, and a good strap button all affect playability and longevity. | Spin the tuning pegs; they should stay in place. Check the bridge for any loose screws. |\n| **Finish & aesthetics** | A finish that feels smooth and looks good can boost your confidence. | Run your hand over the body and neck. No rough spots or peeling paint. |\n| **Budget & resale value** | Decide how much you’re willing to spend and whether you might sell it later. | Compare similar models from the same brand or from other brands. |\n| **Try it out** | The best test is actually playing it. | Play a few songs or scales. Does it feel comfortable? Does it sound the way you want? |\n\n### Quick “Ask the Salesperson” Questions\n\n1. **What’s the recommended setup for a beginner/ intermediate?**  \n2. **Do you offer a free or discounted setup after purchase?**  \n3. **What’s the warranty on the electronics and the body?**  \n4. **Can I bring my own strap and pick‑up kit?**  \n5. **Do you have any models that are known for good sustain or a particular tone?**\n\n### Bonus: If You’re Looking for a Specific Sound\n\n| Style | Recommended Pick‑ups | Suggested Body |\n|-------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Clean, bright (folk, pop) | 2 single‑coils (or a humbucker with a coil‑split) | Alder, maple |\n| Warm, thick (blues, classic rock) | 2 humbuckers | Mahogany, swamp ash |\n| High‑gain, metal | 2 high‑output humbuckers | Alder, mahogany |\n| Acoustic‑like feel | P‑90 or single‑coil | Spruce or cedar top |\n\n### Final Thought\n\nIf you’re still unsure, bring a friend who plays the same style of music or ask the staff to let you play a few songs. The right guitar will feel like an extension of your own body and will inspire you to keep playing. Have fun at the store, and enjoy the new instrument!",

      "system_answer": "Here are some quick, practical ways to stretch your phone’s battery life and keep it running longer between charges:\n\n| Tip | Why it helps | How to do it |\n|-----|--------------|--------------|\n| **Turn off unused features** | Each sensor (GPS, Bluetooth, Wi‑Fi, NFC) draws power even when you’re not using it. | Go to Settings → Connections → toggle off Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, and any “Always on” services. |\n| **Use battery‑saving mode** | Many phones have a built‑in “Battery Saver” or “Low‑Power” mode that throttles background activity and reduces brightness. | Enable it in Settings → Battery → Battery Saver (or similar). |\n| **Reduce screen brightness & timeout** | The display is the biggest power drain. | Lower brightness to 30‑50 % (or use adaptive brightness). Set the screen timeout to 30 seconds or 1 minute. |\n| **Limit background app refresh** | Apps that refresh in the background can drain the battery. | Settings → Apps → (select app) → Battery → Background restriction. |\n| **Close unused apps** | Some apps keep running in the background even after you close them. | Swipe away apps from the recent‑apps list or use a “Force stop” option. |\n| **Disable auto‑updates** | Automatic updates can run overnight and drain the battery. | Settings → System → Software update → Turn off “Auto‑download” or “Auto‑install.” |\n| **Use Wi‑Fi instead of mobile data** | Wi‑Fi is usually more power‑efficient than cellular data. | Connect to Wi‑Fi whenever possible. |\n| **Turn off vibration** | Vibration motors consume more power than simple sound alerts. | Settings → Sound → Disable vibration for notifications. |\n| **Keep the phone cool** | Heat accelerates battery degradation. | Avoid leaving the phone in direct sunlight or hot cars. |\n| **Check battery‑intensive apps** | Some apps (games, streaming, navigation) use a lot of power. | Settings → Battery → Battery usage → Identify & limit or uninstall heavy apps. |\n| **Use a power‑efficient theme** | Dark themes use less power on OLED screens. | Settings → Display → Theme → Dark mode. |\n| **Replace the battery** | If your phone is a few years old, the battery may have lost capacity. | If you’re comfortable, replace it yourself or have a professional do it. |\n\n### Quick “one‑minute” fixes\n1. **Restart** – A quick reboot clears background processes.  \n2. **Airplane mode** – Turn it on for a few minutes if you’re in a low‑signal area; it stops the phone from constantly searching for a network.  \n3. **Battery‑saving app** – If you’re on Android, apps like Greenify can put unused apps to sleep. (iOS has built‑in restrictions.)\n\n### If you’re still seeing a rapid drain\n- **Check for software updates** – Manufacturers often release battery‑optimization patches.  \n- **Factory reset** – As a last resort, back up your data and reset the phone; this can clear any rogue background processes.  \n- **Professional check** – If the battery still drains quickly after all these steps, it might be a hardware issue (e.g., a faulty charging port or a failing battery).\n\nPick the tips that fit your usage pattern, and you should see a noticeable improvement in battery life. Happy charging!",

      "system_answer": "Here’s a quick, practical “kitchen‑clean‑up playbook” that you can run through in 10–15 minutes a day (or once a week) to keep the space tidy without it feeling like a chore.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Set a 5‑Minute “Tidy‑Up” Routine**\n\n- **Every time you finish cooking**:  \n  1. Wash or load the pot/plate into the dishwasher.  \n  2. Wipe the stove top and counter with a damp cloth.  \n  3. Put any leftover ingredients back in their proper spot.  \n  4. Toss trash or recycle immediately.  \n  5. Sweep or vacuum the floor if you notice crumbs.\n\nDoing this right after each meal prevents messes from piling up.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Create “Zones” for Everything**\n\n| Zone | What Goes Here | Why It Helps |\n|------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Prep Zone** | Cutting boards, knives, measuring cups | Keeps sharp tools out of the way of food. |\n| **Cook Zone** | Pots, pans, stove, oven | Keeps cooking surfaces clear for the next dish. |\n| **Storage Zone** | Fridge, pantry, cabinets | Items stay where they belong, so you never dig through a pile. |\n| **Cleanup Zone** | Sink, dishwasher, trash can | All cleanup tools in one spot, so you don’t wander around. |\n\nLabel each zone with a small sign or a color‑coded sticker so you and anyone else in the kitchen know where things belong.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Use “One‑In, One‑Out” for Pantry Items**\n\n- Every time you buy a new jar of pasta sauce or a bag of rice, **remove** an older item that’s close to its expiration date.  \n- This keeps the pantry from becoming a “stuffed” mess and reduces waste.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Keep the Countertops Clear**\n\n- **Rule of thumb**: Only keep items that you use daily on the counter (e.g., a toaster, a small blender, a cutting board).  \n- Store everything else in cabinets or drawers.  \n- If you’re short on cabinet space, consider a **pull‑out spice rack** or a **vertical storage rack** for jars.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Quick‑Clean Tools**\n\n| Tool | How to Use | When to Use |\n|------|------------|-------------|\n| **Microfiber Cloth** | Wipes up spills instantly. | After cooking or when you see a drip. |\n| **Dishwasher‑Safe Sponges** | Replace every 2–3 weeks. | After each meal. |\n| **Baking Soda** | Natural deodorizer for the fridge. | Sprinkle on a shallow dish, leave overnight. |\n| **Vinegar Solution** | Disinfects surfaces. | Mix 1 cup vinegar + 1 cup water. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Weekly “Deep‑Clean” Checklist**\n\n| Task | Frequency | Quick Tips |\n|------|-----------|------------|\n| **Clean the fridge** | Weekly | Remove expired items, wipe shelves with warm soapy water. |\n| **Sweep/Vacuum floor** | Weekly | Use a small broom or a handheld vacuum. |\n| **Wipe down cabinets** | Monthly | Use a mild cleaner; avoid harsh chemicals that can damage finishes. |\n| **Check for food waste** | Weekly | Empty trash and recycling bins; compost if you have a bin. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Make Use of Storage Aids**\n\n- **Lazy Susan** in the pantry or cabinets to pull out items easily.  \n- **Drawer dividers** for utensils, spices, or baking tools.  \n- **Clear storage bins** for bulk items (flour, sugar, rice) so you can see contents at a glance.\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Involve Everyone**\n\n- If you share the kitchen, assign simple tasks: “You’re in charge of wiping the stove after dinner.”  \n- Use a shared calendar or a sticky note on the fridge to remind everyone of their “clean‑up duty.”\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Keep a “Clean‑Up Kit” on Hand**\n\n- A small bag or basket with:  \n  - Microfiber cloths  \n  - Dish soap  \n  - Sponges  \n  - Trash bags  \n  - A small broom or dustpan  \n\nPlace it near the sink or in a cabinet so you can grab it quickly.\n\n---\n\n## 10. **Set a “Kitchen Clean‑Up Alarm”**\n\n- Put a timer on your phone for 10 minutes after dinner.  \n- When it rings, you know it’s time to do the quick‑tidy routine.  \n- It turns cleaning into a game: “Beat the timer!”\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap\n\n1. **5‑minute tidy after each meal**  \n2. **Zone everything** (prep, cook, storage, cleanup)  \n3. **One‑in, one‑out** for pantry  \n4. **Clear countertops** – only daily-use items  \n5. **Weekly deep‑clean** (fridge, floor, cabinets)  \n6. **Use storage aids** (Lazy Susan, dividers, clear bins)  \n7. **Involve everyone** with simple chores  \n8. **Keep a clean‑up kit** handy  \n9. **Set a timer** to keep the habit\n\nBy turning cleaning into a series of quick, repeatable actions, you’ll keep the kitchen from becoming a mess again—without spending hours each week.

      "system_answer": "Here’s a quick “slow‑cooker success playbook” that covers everything from prep to seasoning to timing—so you can turn those “meh” results into restaurant‑quality meals.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Start with the Right Ingredients**\n\n| Ingredient | Why it matters | Tips |\n|------------|----------------|------|\n| **Meat** | Cuts of meat that become tender in low heat (e.g., chuck, brisket, pork shoulder). | Trim excess fat, but leave a small fat cap for flavor. |\n| **Vegetables** | Root veggies (carrots, potatoes, onions) hold up well; leafy greens wilt quickly. | Cut veggies into uniform pieces so they cook evenly. |\n| **Liquids** | Broth, wine, or a combination gives depth; too much liquid can dilute flavors. | Use about 1–1.5 cups of liquid for a 6‑quart cooker. |\n| **Seasonings** | Herbs and spices lock in flavor during long cook times. | Add most seasonings at the start; add fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro) at the end. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Sear (Optional but Powerful)**\n\n- **Why**: Browning meat creates Maillard reactions that deepen flavor.  \n- **How**: Sear each side in a hot skillet for 2–3 min before adding to the slow cooker.  \n- **Tip**: If you’re short on time, skip searing—just add a splash of broth and let the slow cooker do the work.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Layering Matters**\n\n- **Bottom layer**: Place root veggies first; they need the most time.  \n- **Middle layer**: Add meat.  \n- **Top layer**: Finish with delicate veggies (e.g., tomatoes, zucchini) or herbs that wilt quickly.  \n- **Why**: Prevents over‑cooking of tender ingredients.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Liquid Balance**\n\n- **Rule of thumb**: 1 cup liquid per 2–3 cups of solid ingredients.  \n- **Avoid**: “Too much” liquid that turns the dish into soup.  \n- **Fix**: If it’s too watery, remove the lid, turn the heat to “high,” and let it reduce for 15–30 min.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Timing & Temperature**\n\n| Dish | Low (8–10 h) | High (4–6 h) |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| Beef stew | 8–10 h | 4–6 h |\n| Pulled pork | 8–10 h | 4–6 h |\n| Chicken curry | 6–8 h | 3–4 h |\n| Vegetable soup | 4–6 h | 2–3 h |\n\n- **Tip**: If you’re in a hurry, use the “high” setting, but be careful not to over‑cook delicate proteins.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Seasoning Strategy**\n\n| Stage | What to add | Why |\n|-------|-------------|-----|\n| **Start** | Salt, pepper, dried herbs, spices | Builds base flavor. |\n| **Mid‑cook** | Sweeteners (brown sugar, honey) or acidity (wine, vinegar) | Balances richness. |\n| **End** | Fresh herbs, citrus zest, a splash of cream or coconut milk | Brightens and rounds out the dish. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Texture Tweaks**\n\n- **Thickening**:  \n  - **Cornstarch slurry** (1 Tbsp cornstarch + 1 Tbsp cold water) added in the last 30 min.  \n  - **Pureed vegetables** (e.g., carrots, tomatoes) stirred in to naturally thicken.  \n- **Avoid**: Adding thickening agents too early—they’ll break down.\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Common Pitfalls & Fixes**\n\n| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| **Meat too dry** | Too much liquid evaporated or over‑cooked. | Add a splash of broth, or finish on “high” for 15 min to re‑hydrate. |\n| **Vegetables mushy** | Cooked too long. | Add them in the last 1–2 h, or use firmer varieties (carrots, potatoes). |\n| **Flavor flat** | Not enough seasoning or too much salt. | Taste after 4 h; add more spices, a pinch of salt, or a splash of acid. |\n| **Too watery** | Too much liquid or no thickening. | Reduce liquid by simmering uncovered, or add a thickener. |\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Quick Recipe Templates**\n\n### Classic Beef Stew\n1. Sear 2 lb chuck, 1 Tbsp oil, 2 Tbsp flour (optional).  \n2. Add 4 cups beef broth, 2 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 Tbsp Worcestershire.  \n3. Add 4 cups diced carrots, potatoes, onions.  \n4. Cook **low** 8–10 h.  \n5. Add 1 Tbsp cornstarch slurry, stir, cook 15 min on **high**.\n\n### Pulled Pork\n1. Rub 2 lb pork shoulder with 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, salt, pepper.  \n2. Place in cooker, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar + 1 cup chicken broth.  \n3. Cook **low** 8–10 h.  \n4. Shred, add ½ cup BBQ sauce, cook 15 min on **high**.\n\n### Chicken Curry\n1. Sauté onions, garlic, ginger in 1 Tbsp oil.  \n2. Add 2 Tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp cumin.  \n3. Add 1 lb chicken thighs, 1 cup coconut milk, 1 cup diced tomatoes.  \n4. Cook **low** 6–8 h.  \n5. Finish with fresh cilantro, lime juice.\n\n---\n\n## 10. **Pro‑Tips for Consistency**\n\n1. **Use a thermometer**: 165 °F for poultry, 190–200 °F for beef.  \n2. **Keep the lid on**: Opening the lid releases heat and extends cooking time.  \n3. **Prep in advance**: Chop veggies, season meat, and have everything ready before you start.  \n4. **Label your pot**: Write the recipe name and date on a sticky note so you know what’s inside.  \n5. **Keep a “slow‑cooker journal”**: Note what worked, what",
