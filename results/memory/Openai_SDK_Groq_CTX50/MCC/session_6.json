      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "### Target Heart Rate (THR)\n\n**Target heart rate** is the range of heart‑beat frequencies (beats per minute, bpm) that you aim to stay within during aerobic exercise. It’s a practical way to gauge how hard your body is working and to ensure you’re training at an intensity that matches your fitness goals—whether that’s improving cardiovascular health, burning fat, or building endurance.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Use a Target Heart Rate?\n\n| Goal | Typical THR Zone | Why It Matters |\n|------|------------------|----------------|\n| **General fitness / health** | 50–70 % of maximum heart rate (MHR) | Low‑moderate intensity keeps the heart healthy without over‑stressing it. |\n| **Fat loss** | 60–70 % MHR | Burns a higher proportion of calories from fat while still being sustainable. |\n| **Aerobic conditioning** | 70–85 % MHR | Improves VO₂ max, increases aerobic capacity. |\n| **Anaerobic / high‑intensity training** | 85–95 % MHR | Builds speed, power, and lactate tolerance. |\n\nUsing a THR helps you:\n\n- **Stay safe** – avoid over‑exertion or under‑exertion.\n- **Track progress** – see if you’re getting stronger (you can hit higher zones with the same effort).\n- **Tailor workouts** – mix zones for interval training, steady‑state cardio, or recovery sessions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to Calculate Your Target Heart Rate\n\n### Step 1: Estimate Your Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)\n\nThe most common formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MHR} = 220 - \\text{age}\n\\]\n\n*Example:* A 35‑year‑old → 220 – 35 = 185 bpm.\n\n**Other formulas** (for more precision or specific populations):\n\n| Formula | When to Use |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 208 – 0.7 × age | More accurate for adults 20–60 yrs |\n| 206 – 0.88 × age | Better for older adults |\n| 210 – 0.5 × age | For athletes or those with high fitness |\n\n### Step 2: Determine Your Target Zone\n\n| Intensity | % of MHR | Typical Zone |\n|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| Light | 50–60 % | Easy walking, light jogging |\n| Moderate | 60–70 % | Comfortable cardio, can talk |\n| Hard | 70–80 % | Challenging, can speak in short phrases |\n| Very Hard | 80–90 % | Hard effort, can’t speak more than a few words |\n| Max | 90–100 % | Sprint, all‑out effort |\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the bpm Range\n\n\\[\n\\text{Lower bound} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{lower %}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Upper bound} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{upper %}\n\\]\n\n*Example (35‑year‑old, moderate zone 60–70 %):*\n\n- Lower: 185 × 0.60 = 111 bpm\n- Upper: 185 × 0.70 = 129 bpm\n\n**Target Heart Rate Zone:** 111–129 bpm.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Monitor Your Heart Rate\n\n| Method | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| **Manual pulse** (wrist or neck) | Free, no equipment | Less accurate, hard during intense exercise |\n| **Chest strap HR monitor** | Very accurate, real‑time | Requires purchase, can be uncomfortable |\n| **Wrist‑worn smartwatch** | Convenient, tracks many metrics | Accuracy varies, may drift |\n| **Smartphone app + external sensor** | Affordable, many apps | Requires pairing, may lag |\n\n**Tip:** For most people, a chest strap or a high‑quality smartwatch (e.g., Garmin, Apple Watch, Polar) gives the best balance of accuracy and convenience.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Tips for Using THR\n\n1. **Warm‑up & Cool‑down**  \n   - Start in the light zone (50–60 %) for 5–10 min.  \n   - Finish with 5–10 min in the same zone.\n\n2. **Use Zones in Workouts**  \n   - **Steady‑state cardio:** 70–80 % for 30–60 min.  \n   - **Interval training:** 80–90 % for 30–60 sec, then 50–60 % for recovery.  \n   - **Recovery sessions:** 50–60 % for active rest days.\n\n3. **Adjust for Fitness Level**  \n   - If you’re new, start at the lower end of the moderate zone.  \n   - As you improve, you can push toward the higher end or add hard zones.\n\n4. **Check for “Red Flags”**  \n   - Chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath → stop and seek medical advice.  \n   - If you can’t maintain the target zone for 5–10 min, you may be over‑exerting.\n\n5. **Track Progress**  \n   - Log your workouts with HR data.  \n   - Over weeks, you’ll notice you can hit higher zones with the same effort, indicating improved cardiovascular fitness.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| **“220‑age is always correct.”** | It’s a rough estimate; individual variation can be ±10 bpm. |\n| **“Higher heart rate always burns more calories.”** | Not necessarily; moderate‑intensity can burn more total calories over a longer period. |\n| **“I can ignore HR if I feel good.”** | Feeling good doesn’t guarantee you’re training in the right zone; HR gives objective data. |\n| **“Target HR is only for cardio.”** | It’s useful for any aerobic activity—running, cycling, rowing, swimming, even brisk walking. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick Reference Table\n\n| Age | MHR (220‑age) | 50–60 % | 60–70 % | 70–80 % | 80–90 % |\n|-----|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 20 | 200 | 100–120 | 120–140 | 140–160 | 160–180 |\n| 30 | 190 | 95–114 | 114–133 | 133–152 | 152–171 |\n| 40 | 180 | 90–108 | 108–126 | 126–144 | 144–162 |\n| 50 | 170 | 85–102 | 102–119 | 119–136 | 136–153 |\n| 60 | 160 | 80–96 | 96–112 | 112–128 | 128–144 |\n\n*(All values in bpm.)*\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nTarget heart rate is a simple, science‑backed tool that lets you train smarter, not harder. By calculating your own zones and staying within them during workouts, you can safely reach your fitness goals—whether that’s a healthier heart, more endurance, or better performance. Happy training!",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun itself isn’t actually “yellow” – it emits a broad spectrum of light that, when combined, looks white. The yellowish hue we see from Earth is mainly a result of the way our atmosphere interacts with that light.\n\n### 1. The Sun’s true color\n- **Surface temperature**: The Sun’s surface (photosphere) is about 5,800 K. A black‑body at that temperature emits a spectrum that peaks in the green part of the visible range, but the overall mix of wavelengths is close to white.\n- **Spectral output**: If you could take a direct snapshot of the Sun with a spectrometer, you’d see a continuous spectrum with absorption lines (Fraunhofer lines) – no single color dominates.\n\n### 2. Atmospheric scattering\n- **Rayleigh scattering**: Short‑wavelength (blue) light is scattered much more strongly by the molecules in Earth’s atmosphere than longer wavelengths (red, yellow, orange). When the Sun is high in the sky, the light that reaches us has passed through a relatively short column of air, so the blue component is scattered out of the direct line of sight, leaving a mix that looks yellowish.\n- **Mie scattering**: Larger particles (dust, aerosols) scatter all wavelengths more equally, but still contribute to the overall “whitening” of the sky and can slightly shift the perceived color of the Sun.\n\n### 3. Why the Sun can look different\n| Situation | What happens | Resulting color |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **High noon** | Short atmospheric path, strong Rayleigh scattering of blue | Sun appears pale yellow or white |\n| **Sunrise/sunset** | Long path through atmosphere, blue light scattered out, red light dominates | Sun looks orange/red |\n| **Clear, dry air** | Less scattering, Sun can appear almost white | Sun appears very bright, almost white |\n| **Hazy or dusty air** | Mie scattering adds a whitish haze | Sun may look more washed out or slightly yellowish |\n\n### 4. Human perception\n- Our eyes are more sensitive to green and yellow wavelengths, so a mix of green, yellow, and some blue can be perceived as “yellowish” even if the Sun’s light is essentially white.\n- The sky itself is blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which also influences how we perceive the Sun’s color.\n\n### Bottom line\n- **The Sun emits white light.**\n- **Atmospheric scattering removes a lot of the blue component from the light that reaches us, leaving a yellowish tint.**\n- **The apparent color changes with the Sun’s position, atmospheric conditions, and the observer’s eye.**\n\nSo, the Sun isn’t truly yellow; it’s our atmosphere that turns its white light into the familiar yellow glow we see during the day.",

      "question": "What is foot and mouth disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, and many other livestock species. It is caused by a virus in the *Picornaviridae* family, genus *Aphthovirus* (the FMD virus, or FMDV).  \n\n---\n\n### 1.  Key Features\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Virus** | FMDV – single‑stranded, positive‑sense RNA virus, ~7.5 kb.  Six serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3) and numerous sub‑serotypes. |\n| **Hosts** | All cloven‑hoofed animals; also some wildlife (e.g., wild boar, deer). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact, airborne spread, contaminated feed, equipment, clothing, and even water. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Incubation period** | 2–14 days (average 4–7 days). |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 41–42 °C) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, inside the mouth, and on the lips <br>• Vesicles on the feet and hooves (hence the name) <br>• Swelling of the interdigital spaces (between toes) <br>• Lameness, reduced feed intake, weight loss, decreased milk production, and in young animals, death. |\n| **Diagnosis** | Clinical observation + laboratory tests: ELISA, virus isolation, RT‑PCR, or virus neutralization tests. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses from mortality, decreased production, trade restrictions, and control costs. In severe outbreaks, entire herds can be culled, and export bans can last months to years. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Why It Matters\n\n- **Global trade**: Many countries have strict import/export regulations for FMD‑free status. An outbreak can lead to immediate bans on livestock and animal products.\n- **Public health**: The virus is not a zoonosis; it does not infect humans. However, it can cause significant economic hardship for farmers and the food industry.\n- **Wildlife reservoirs**: In some regions, wild ungulates (e.g., wild boar in Europe, deer in the U.S.) can maintain the virus and re‑introduce it to domestic herds.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Prevention & Control\n\n| Strategy | What it involves |\n|----------|------------------|\n| **Vaccination** | In endemic or high‑risk areas, live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines are used. Vaccination schedules depend on local regulations and the serotype present. |\n| **Movement restrictions** | Quarantine of infected or exposed animals; controlled movement of livestock and equipment. |\n| **Culling** | In many countries, infected and exposed animals are slaughtered to stop spread. |\n| **Biosecurity** | Strict hygiene, disinfection of vehicles, feed, and equipment; use of dedicated clothing and footwear. |\n| **Surveillance** | Routine testing of herds, especially in high‑risk zones. |\n| **Rapid response** | Immediate reporting to veterinary authorities, isolation of suspected cases, and swift implementation of control measures. |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Recent Global Context (as of 2025)\n\n- **Europe**: The 2022–2023 outbreak in the UK and Ireland led to widespread culling and a temporary ban on livestock exports. Vaccination campaigns were rolled out in affected regions.\n- **United States**: The 2001 outbreak in the U.S. (primarily in the Midwest) caused massive culling and economic loss. Since then, the U.S. maintains a “FMD‑free” status with strict surveillance and rapid response protocols.\n- **Asia & Africa**: Countries like India, Pakistan, and several African nations experience endemic FMD, with seasonal outbreaks linked to livestock movements and trade.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Quick Takeaway\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a **highly contagious viral disease** that devastates livestock production and can cripple international trade. While it poses no direct risk to human health, its economic repercussions are profound, making prevention, rapid detection, and stringent biosecurity essential tools for managing the disease.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation And Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and characterize objects or features in a medium—most commonly water. By emitting acoustic pulses and listening for their echoes, sonar systems can determine distance, speed, direction, and sometimes even the shape or composition of submerged targets.\n\n---\n\n## How Sonar Works\n\n| Step | What Happens | Key Concepts |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Transmission** | A transducer emits a short burst of sound (the “ping”). | Frequency (kHz–MHz), pulse length, beam pattern |\n| **Propagation** | The sound travels through the medium (water, ice, etc.). | Speed of sound (~1500 m/s in seawater), refraction, attenuation |\n| **Reflection / Scattering** | The pulse encounters an object or boundary and is reflected back. | Target strength, angle of incidence, surface roughness |\n| **Reception** | The transducer (or a separate receiver) picks up the echo. | Time‑of‑flight, Doppler shift |\n| **Processing** | The system converts the echo into useful information. | Range = (speed × time)/2, velocity from Doppler, imaging from multiple beams |\n\n---\n\n## Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | Description | Typical Use |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Navigation, obstacle avoidance, fish-finding, depth sounding |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects (e.g., engines, propellers). | Anti‑submarine warfare, wildlife monitoring |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped beams to create high‑resolution images of the seafloor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys |\n| **Multibeam Echo Sounder** | Sends multiple beams at different angles to map bathymetry. | Hydrographic charting |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Uses high‑frequency sound to produce detailed images of objects. | Underwater robotics, inspection of pipelines |\n| **Subbottom Profiling** | Sends low‑frequency sound to penetrate sediment layers. | Geology, oil & gas exploration |\n\n---\n\n## Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | What It Tells You | Typical Range |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Frequency** | Determines resolution vs. penetration. | 10 kHz–10 MHz |\n| **Beamwidth** | Angular spread of the transmitted sound. | 1°–30° |\n| **Pulse Length** | Time duration of the emitted burst. | 0.1–10 ms |\n| **Signal‑to‑Noise Ratio (SNR)** | Clarity of the echo relative to background noise. | > 10 dB for reliable detection |\n| **Maximum Range** | Distance at which echoes can still be detected. | 10 m–10 km (depends on power, frequency, environment) |\n\n---\n\n## Common Applications\n\n| Domain | Example Uses |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Naval & Military** | Submarine detection, mine countermeasures, navigation |\n| **Commercial Shipping** | Collision avoidance, depth sounding |\n| **Fishing** | Fish‑finder, fish‑aggregation detection |\n| **Scientific Research** | Oceanography, marine biology, seafloor mapping |\n| **Industrial** | Pipeline inspection, offshore drilling |\n| **Recreational** | Angling, scuba diving, underwater photography |\n\n---\n\n## Historical Snapshot\n\n- **1900s**: First practical sonar developed for submarine detection during WWI.\n- **1940s**: WWII accelerated sonar research; passive sonar became crucial for anti‑submarine warfare.\n- **1960s–70s**: Introduction of side‑scan and multibeam systems for detailed seabed mapping.\n- **1990s–present**: Miniaturization, digital signal processing, and integration with GPS and GIS systems have made sonar ubiquitous in both military and civilian contexts.\n\n---\n\n## Fun Fact\n\nThe term “sonar” was coined in the 1940s by the U.S. Navy, combining *sound* and *navigation*. The word has since become a generic term for any acoustic detection system, much like “radar” for radio.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSonar is an acoustic “radar” that lets us “see” underwater by sending sound waves and interpreting the echoes that bounce back. Its versatility—from detecting submarines to mapping the ocean floor—makes it one of the most important tools for exploring and navigating the world’s waters.",

It is considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning that the nervous system amplifies pain signals.\n\n| Aspect | What you need to know |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| **Core symptom** | Widespread pain lasting at least 3 months, affecting both sides of the body and above and below the waist. |\n| **Common accompanying symptoms** | • Fatigue, sleep disturbances, “fibro fog” (memory/attention problems) <br>• Headaches (often tension‑type or migraines) <br>• Irritable bowel syndrome, constipation or diarrhea <br>• Depression or anxiety <br>• Sensitivity to light, sound, temperature, or pressure |\n| **Who gets it?** | Most often women (about 80–90 % of diagnosed cases), usually between 30–50 years old, but it can affect anyone. |\n| **Causes** | Not fully understood. Likely a mix of: <br>• Genetic predisposition <br>• Abnormal pain‑processing in the brain and spinal cord <br>• Triggering events (stress, infection, trauma, sleep deprivation) |\n| **Diagnosis** | No single lab test. Doctors use: <br>• A detailed medical history and physical exam <br>• The 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria: widespread pain index (WPI) + symptom severity scale (SSS) ≥ 12, plus pain in at least 4 of 5 body regions for ≥3 months <br>• Rule‑out other conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease) |\n| **Treatment** | Multifaceted approach: <br>• **Medications** – duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, or low‑dose amitriptyline for pain and sleep <br>• **Exercise** – low‑impact aerobic activity, stretching, strength training (often improves pain and fatigue) <br>• **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** – helps manage pain perception and coping <br>• **Sleep hygiene** – consistent bedtime routine, avoiding stimulants <br>• **Lifestyle changes** – stress reduction, balanced diet, hydration <br>• **Complementary therapies** – acupuncture, massage, tai chi, yoga (evidence varies) |\n| **Prognosis** | Chronic but variable. Many people experience periods of flare‑ups and remission. With proper management, most can lead active, productive lives. |\n| **Key take‑away** | Fibromyalgia is a real, medically recognized condition that involves heightened pain sensitivity and a host of systemic symptoms. It requires a comprehensive, individualized treatment plan rather than a single “cure.” |\n\nIf you suspect you or someone you know might have fibromyalgia, it’s best to consult a rheumatologist or primary care provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized management plan.",

Example\n\nSuppose you invest **$1,000** at an annual interest rate of **6 %**, compounded **quarterly** for **3 years**.\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)\n- \\(r = 0.06\\)\n- \\(n = 4\\) (quarterly)\n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 3}\n  = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + 0.015\\right)^{12}\n  = 1{,}000 \\times 1.015^{12}\n  \\approx 1{,}000 \\times 1.195618\n  \\approx \\$1{,}195.62\n\\]\n\nSo after 3 years you would have about **$1,195.62**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Effective Annual Rate (EAR)\n\nThe effective annual rate tells you the true yearly return when compounding is taken into account:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n} - 1\n\\]\n\nUsing the example above:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4} - 1\n           = 1.015^{4} - 1\n           \\approx 0.0614 \\text{ or } 6.14\\%\n\\]\n\nSo although the nominal rate is 6 %, the effective return is about 6.14 % per year.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key take‑aways\n\n1. **Compound interest** means interest is earned on both the original principal and on previously earned interest.\n2. The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the future value.\n3. Continuous compounding gives the theoretical maximum growth for a given rate and time.\n4. The effective annual rate (EAR) is useful for comparing investments or loans with different compounding frequencies.\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like to see more examples, or how to calculate compound interest for loans, savings accounts, or bonds!",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals combine (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that are better suited for bonding in molecules. It helps rationalize the geometry and bonding patterns of molecules that cannot be explained by simple valence‑bond theory alone.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Hybridization Was Introduced\n\n- **Valence‑bond theory** (VBT) described bonds as overlaps of atomic orbitals, but it struggled to explain the observed shapes of molecules such as methane (CH₄) or ammonia (NH₃).\n- **Molecular‑orbital theory** could predict shapes but was mathematically complex for many students.\n- **Hybridization** offered a middle ground: it kept the intuitive picture of localized bonds while accounting for the observed geometries.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Basic Idea\n\n1. **Start with the central atom’s valence orbitals** (s, p, d, …).  \n2. **Combine** a certain number of these orbitals to produce a set of *hybrid orbitals* that are:\n   - **Equal in energy** (degenerate)\n   - **Directed** toward the positions of the bonded atoms\n3. **Use** these hybrids to form σ‑bonds (and sometimes π‑bonds) with surrounding atoms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common Hybridization Types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of Hybrid Orbitals | Geometry (ideal) | Example Molecule |\n|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| **sp** | 2 | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, CO₂ |\n| **sp²** | 3 | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, C₃H₆ (cyclopropane) |\n| **sp³** | 4 | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅, SF₄ |\n| **sp³d²** | 6 | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆, XeF₆ |\n\n> **Note:** The “d” orbitals involved in sp³d and sp³d² hybridization are usually the *d* orbitals of the central atom (e.g., 3d for P, 4d for Xe). In many cases, the contribution of d orbitals is small; the concept remains useful for geometry prediction.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Determine Hybridization\n\n1. **Count the regions of electron density** around the central atom (bonding pairs + lone pairs).  \n   - Use the **VSEPR** (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) model to count these regions.\n2. **Match the count to a hybridization type**:\n   - 2 regions → sp\n   - 3 regions → sp²\n   - 4 regions → sp³\n   - 5 regions → sp³d\n   - 6 regions → sp³d²\n3. **Check for lone pairs**: They occupy hybrid orbitals just like bonds, so they affect geometry.\n\n**Example:**  \n- **NH₃**: 3 N–H bonds + 1 lone pair = 4 regions → sp³ hybridization → tetrahedral electron geometry, trigonal pyramidal molecular shape.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Hybrid Orbitals in Action\n\n### 5.1. Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons: 2s² 2p².  \n- Hybridize one 2s and three 2p orbitals → 4 sp³ orbitals.  \n- Each sp³ orbital overlaps with an H 1s orbital → 4 equivalent σ bonds.  \n- Result: tetrahedral geometry, 109.5° H–C–H angles.\n\n### 5.2. Ethylene (C₂H₄)\n\n- Each carbon uses sp² hybridization (3 hybrids) → 3 σ bonds (2 C–H, 1 C–C).  \n- The remaining unhybridized 2p orbital on each carbon overlaps side‑by‑side → π bond.  \n- Geometry: trigonal planar around each carbon, 120° C–C–H angles.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Limitations & Modern View\n\n- **Hybridization is a useful teaching tool** but not a fundamental quantum‑mechanical requirement.  \n- In *ab initio* calculations, orbitals are described by *molecular orbitals* that are linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).  \n- For many transition‑metal complexes, the simple sp³d or sp³d² picture is oversimplified; ligand field theory or crystal field theory provides a more accurate description.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n| Regions of Electron Density | Hybridization | Ideal Geometry | Typical Bond Angle |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| 2 | sp | Linear | 180° |\n| 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 120° |\n| 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n| 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 90° |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nHybridization is a conceptual framework that explains how atoms form bonds with specific geometries by mixing their valence orbitals into new, directionally oriented hybrids. It bridges the gap between simple valence‑bond theory and the more complex quantum mechanical description of molecules.",

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nAlcohol is absorbed very quickly—most of it enters the bloodstream within the first 30–90 minutes after you start drinking. On average, the body takes up about **0.1–0.2 g of alcohol per minute** (≈ 6–12 g per hour). That means a standard drink (≈ 14 g of pure alcohol) will be largely absorbed in roughly 2–3 hours, and the peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC) is usually reached about 30–90 minutes after consumption.\n\n---\n\n## How the absorption works\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical timing |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Stomach** | A small fraction (≈ 20–30 %) of the alcohol is absorbed directly through the stomach lining. | Within the first 10–20 minutes. |\n| **Small intestine** | The bulk of the alcohol (≈ 70–80 %) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum. | 30–90 minutes after drinking. |\n| **Peak BAC** | The highest concentration in the blood is reached. | 30–90 minutes after the start of drinking. |\n| **Plateau** | Absorption slows as the stomach empties and the intestine’s capacity is reached. | 1–2 hours after drinking. |\n| **Metabolism** | The liver metabolizes alcohol at a fairly constant rate (~0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour in most adults). | Begins immediately but becomes the limiting factor after the initial absorption phase. |\n\n---\n\n## Factors that influence the rate\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Presence of food** | Slows gastric emptying → slower absorption; peak BAC is lower and delayed. |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑strength drinks (e.g., spirits) are absorbed faster than lower‑strength drinks (e.g., beer). |\n| **Rate of consumption** | Rapid sipping or binge drinking increases the amount absorbed per unit time. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Larger or more muscular individuals may have a slightly lower peak BAC for the same amount of alcohol. |\n| **Gender** | Women generally have a higher peak BAC than men for the same dose, partly due to lower body water content. |\n| **Metabolic enzymes** | Genetic variations in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) can speed up or slow down metabolism. |\n| **Medications & health conditions** | Certain drugs or liver disease can alter absorption or metabolism. |\n\n---\n\n## Typical BAC curves\n\n| Time after start of drinking | Approximate BAC rise (average adult) |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 0–15 min | 0–0.01 % |\n| 15–30 min | 0.01–0.02 % |\n| 30–60 min | 0.02–0.04 % |\n| 60–90 min | 0.04–0.06 % |\n| 90–120 min | 0.06–0.08 % |\n| 120–180 min | 0.08–0.10 % (peak for a single standard drink) |\n\n> **Note:** These numbers are averages. Individual BAC curves can vary widely.\n\n---\n\n## Practical take‑aways\n\n1. **Don’t wait for “dryness”** – even if you feel fine, alcohol is still being absorbed and will raise your BAC for up to an hour or more after you stop drinking.\n2. **Food helps** – eating before or while drinking slows absorption and lowers peak BAC, but it does not eliminate the effect.\n3. **Speed matters** – sipping slowly can keep the absorption rate lower than gulping or binge‑drinking.\n4. **Metabolism is slow** – the liver can only process about 0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour, so once the absorption phase is over, the BAC will decline at that rate.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAlcohol is absorbed rapidly—roughly 0.1–0.2 g per minute—so a standard drink will be largely absorbed within 2–3 hours, with peak BAC reached about 30–90 minutes after you start drinking. The exact rate depends on many factors, but the general pattern is quick absorption followed by a slower metabolic clearance.",

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": "**Poliomyelitis** (often called *polio*) is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the spinal cord and brain, leading to muscle weakness or paralysis.  \n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | Poliovirus – a small, non‑enveloped, single‑stranded RNA virus of the *Picornaviridae* family. |\n| **Transmission** | Primarily fecal‑oral route (contaminated food or water). It can also spread via respiratory droplets in areas with poor sanitation. |\n| **Incubation period** | 7–14 days (range 3–35 days). |\n| **Clinical spectrum** | 1. **Asymptomatic** – most infections (≈ 90 %) show no symptoms. 2. **Non‑paralytic (flu‑like)** – fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild muscle aches. 3. **Paralytic** – sudden flaccid paralysis of limbs, often asymmetric; can involve respiratory muscles, leading to life‑threatening complications. |\n| **Pathogenesis** | The virus invades the enteric nervous system, spreads hematogenously, and can reach the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, destroying motor neurons. |\n| **Diagnosis** | PCR or viral culture from stool, throat swab, or CSF; serology for antibodies. |\n| **Treatment** | No antiviral therapy; supportive care (rehabilitation, respiratory support). Early physical therapy can improve outcomes. |\n| **Prevention** | • **Vaccination** – inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) or oral polio vaccine (OPV). IPV is now the standard in most countries. <br>• **Sanitation** – clean water, hand hygiene. |\n| **Global status** | Thanks to mass vaccination campaigns, polio has been eradicated in most of the world. As of 2024, endemic transmission remains in only a few countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Pakistan). |\n| **Historical note** | Polio was a major cause of childhood paralysis in the early 20th century. The 1950s–60s saw the development of the first effective vaccine (Salk’s IPV), followed by Sabin’s OPV, which dramatically reduced incidence worldwide. |\n\n**Key takeaway:** Poliomyelitis is a preventable viral disease that can cause irreversible paralysis, but widespread vaccination has nearly eliminated it.",

      "question": "What is the temperature at the center of the earth ?",
      "system_answer": "**Estimated temperature at the center of the Earth**\n\n| Location | Approximate temperature | Notes |\n|----------|------------------------|-------|\n| **Core‑mantle boundary (CMB)** | ~ 4,000 °C (≈ 7,200 °F) | The hottest point in the solid mantle, just above the liquid outer core. |\n| **Outer core (liquid)** | ~ 4,500–5,000 °C (≈ 8,100–9,100 °F) | The temperature rises gradually toward the center. |\n| **Inner core (solid)** | **≈ 5,500–6,000 °C (≈ 9,900–10,900 °F)** | The highest temperature in the Earth, where the iron‑nickel alloy is solid. |\n\n> **Typical consensus:** The temperature at the very center of the Earth is about **5,500 °C to 6,000 °C** (≈ 9,900 °F to 10,900 °F).\n\n---\n\n### How do scientists estimate this?\n\n1. **Seismic wave speeds**  \n   - Seismic waves travel faster through hotter, less dense material. By measuring how fast P‑waves and S‑waves move through the core, geophysicists infer temperature and composition.\n\n2. **Laboratory experiments**  \n   - High‑pressure, high‑temperature experiments on iron‑nickel alloys (the main constituents of the core) provide equations of state that link pressure, density, and temperature.\n\n3. **Thermal models**  \n   - Models of heat flow from the core to the mantle, combined with estimates of heat production (radioactive decay, residual formation heat), give a temperature profile.\n\n4. **Geodynamo simulations**  \n   - The Earth’s magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core. Numerical dynamo models require a certain temperature gradient to reproduce the observed field, constraining core temperatures.\n\n---\n\n### Why the range?\n\n- **Uncertainties in composition**: The exact mix of iron, nickel, sulfur, silicon, and other light elements affects the melting point and density.\n- **Pressure–temperature relation**: Small changes in the equation of state can shift the inferred temperature by several hundred degrees.\n- **Heat flux at the core‑mantle boundary**: Estimates of how much heat escapes from the core vary, influencing the temperature gradient.\n\n---\n\n### Quick facts\n\n- **Core radius**: ~ 3,500 km (inner core ~ 1,220 km, outer core ~ 2,260 km).  \n- **Pressure at the center**: ~ 3.5 million atmospheres (≈ 3.5 × 10¹⁰ Pa).  \n- **Heat sources**: Residual heat from Earth’s formation, gravitational differentiation, and ongoing radioactive decay (mainly of potassium‑40, uranium‑238, and thorium‑232).  \n- **Comparison**: The core temperature is roughly the same as the surface temperature of the Sun’s photosphere (~ 5,500 °C), but the core is far denser and under extreme pressure.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** While we cannot drill to the center, the best scientific consensus places the temperature at the Earth’s core around **5,500–6,000 °C**. This value is derived from seismic data, laboratory experiments, and thermal‑dynamo modeling, and it is consistent across multiple independent studies.",

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar cells** (also called photovoltaic cells) are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. They are the fundamental building blocks of solar‑panel systems and come in a variety of types, sizes, and materials. Below is a concise overview of what they are, how they work, and why they matter.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Definition\n\n- **Solar cell** = a semiconductor device that generates an electric current when exposed to light (photons).\n- The term “photovoltaic” (PV) comes from *photo* (light) + *voltaic* (electricity).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How They Work (The Photovoltaic Effect)\n\n1. **Absorption of Light**  \n   - Photons from sunlight hit the cell’s surface.\n   - Energy from photons excites electrons in the semiconductor material.\n\n2. **Generation of Electron–Hole Pairs**  \n   - Excited electrons leave their atomic bonds, creating “holes” (positive charge carriers).\n\n3. **Separation of Charges**  \n   - A built‑in electric field (created by doping the semiconductor with different elements) pushes electrons toward the n‑type side and holes toward the p‑type side.\n\n4. **Current Flow**  \n   - When the cell’s terminals are connected to an external circuit, electrons flow from the n‑side to the p‑side, producing a usable electric current.\n\n5. **Voltage Output**  \n   - The potential difference between the two sides (≈0.5–0.7 V for a single silicon cell) drives the current.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Components\n\n| Component | Function |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Semiconductor** | Usually silicon (monocrystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous), but also thin‑film materials like CdTe, CIGS, or perovskite. |\n| **Anti‑reflection coating** | Reduces reflection, allowing more light to enter. |\n| **Transparent conductive layer** | Allows light to pass while collecting charge (often ITO or metal grid). |\n| **Back contact** | Provides electrical connection to the negative side. |\n| **Encapsulation** | Protects the cell from moisture, UV, and mechanical damage. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Types of Solar Cells\n\n| Type | Key Features | Typical Efficiency | Common Uses |\n|------|--------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon (mono‑Si)** | Single‑crystal lattice, uniform color | 20–25 % | Residential, commercial panels |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon (poly‑Si)** | Multi‑crystal grains, slightly lower efficiency | 15–20 % | Utility‑scale, cost‑sensitive projects |\n| **Amorphous silicon (a‑Si)** | Thin‑film, flexible | 6–10 % | Building‑integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), portable devices |\n| **Cadmium telluride (CdTe)** | Thin‑film, high absorption | 15–20 % | Utility‑scale, large‑area modules |\n| **Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)** | Thin‑film, high efficiency | 18–22 % | Flexible panels, high‑performance applications |\n| **Perovskite** | Emerging, high efficiency potential | 20–25 % (lab) | Hybrid tandem cells, next‑gen PV |\n| **Organic PV** | Carbon‑based, flexible | 5–10 % | Wearables, low‑power electronics |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Performance Metrics\n\n| Metric | What It Means | Typical Range |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Efficiency** | % of incident sunlight converted to electricity | 15–25 % (commercial) |\n| **Open‑Circuit Voltage (Voc)** | Max voltage when no load is connected | 0.5–0.7 V per cell |\n| **Short‑Circuit Current (Isc)** | Current when terminals shorted | Depends on cell area |\n| **Fill Factor (FF)** | Ratio of actual power to theoretical power | 70–80 % |\n| **Temperature Coefficient** | Efficiency loss per °C rise | –0.3 %/°C (mono‑Si) |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Advantages\n\n- **Renewable & Clean**: No fuel consumption, zero emissions during operation.\n- **Scalable**: From small portable chargers to utility‑scale farms.\n- **Low Operating Costs**: Minimal maintenance once installed.\n- **Modular**: Easy to add or replace individual cells/modules.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Limitations\n\n- **Intermittency**: Only produce power during daylight; weather‑dependent.\n- **Energy‑Intensive Manufacturing**: Silicon purification and wafer production consume energy.\n- **Material Constraints**: Some thin‑film cells use toxic or scarce elements (Cd, Te, In, Ga).\n- **Degradation**: Efficiency can drop over 25–30 years (typically ~0.5 %/year).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Typical Applications\n\n| Application | Solar Cell Type | Why It’s Used |\n|-------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **Residential rooftop** | Mono‑Si or poly‑Si | High efficiency, proven reliability |\n| **Utility‑scale farms** | Mono‑Si, CdTe, CIGS | Large area, cost‑effective |\n| **Portable chargers** | Thin‑film (a‑Si, CIGS) | Lightweight, flexible |\n| **Spacecraft** | GaAs, Si | High efficiency, radiation tolerance |\n| **Building‑Integrated PV (BIPV)** | Thin‑film, perovskite | Aesthetic integration, flexibility |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Future Trends\n\n- **Tandem Cells**: Combining perovskite on top of silicon to surpass 30 % efficiency.\n- **Low‑Cost Materials**: Research into metal‑free, earth‑abundant semiconductors.\n- **Improved Durability**: Encapsulation and anti‑UV coatings to extend lifetimes.\n- **Grid‑Integration**: Smart inverters, storage, and demand‑response systems.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSolar cells are semiconductor devices that turn sunlight into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. They come in many forms—silicon wafers, thin films, and emerging perovskites—each with its own trade‑offs in efficiency, cost, and application. As technology advances, we’re moving toward higher efficiencies, lower costs, and broader integration into everyday life.",

      "question": "What is severance pay ?",
      "system_answer": "**Severance pay** is a financial benefit that an employer may provide to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually due to a layoff, restructuring, or termination that is not the employee’s fault. It is intended to help the employee transition to new employment or to cover living expenses while they search for a new job.\n\n---\n\n### Key Elements\n\n| Element | Typical Content |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Eligibility** | Often tied to length of service, position, or a company policy. Some companies offer it automatically to all employees; others reserve it for certain roles or seniority levels. |\n| **Amount** | Usually expressed as a multiple of the employee’s base salary (e.g., 1–3 weeks’ pay per year of service). The exact figure can vary widely by company, industry, and jurisdiction. |\n| **Duration** | Can range from a few weeks to several months. Some packages include a fixed lump‑sum payment, while others provide a series of regular payments. |\n| **Taxation** | In many countries, severance pay is taxable income. Some jurisdictions allow a tax‑free portion or special deductions. |\n| **Other Benefits** | May include continued health‑insurance coverage, outplacement services, or a letter of recommendation. |\n\n---\n\n### Why Employers Offer Severance\n\n1. **Legal Compliance** – In some regions, severance is required by law or by collective bargaining agreements.\n2. **Reputation & Morale** – A generous severance package can preserve goodwill and reduce negative word‑of‑mouth.\n3. **Legal Protection** – Offering severance can help mitigate claims of wrongful termination or discrimination.\n4. **Business Continuity** – Smooth transitions reduce disruption and help maintain productivity.\n\n---\n\n### Common Variations\n\n| Variation | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Standard Severance** | Fixed weeks of pay per year of service. |\n| **Negotiated Severance** | Employees negotiate terms, often in exchange for a release of claims. |\n| **Severance with Benefits** | Includes continued health‑insurance or other perks. |\n| **Severance for Redundancy** | Paid when a role is eliminated, not due to performance. |\n| **Severance for Resignation** | Rare, but some companies offer “golden parachutes” to executives who resign. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical Tips for Employees\n\n1. **Read the Offer Carefully** – Verify the amount, payment schedule, and any conditions (e.g., signing a release). |\n2. **Check Tax Implications** – Consult a tax professional to understand how the payment will affect your tax return. |\n3. **Negotiate if Possible** – If the offer is below your expectations, you can negotiate for a higher amount or additional benefits. |\n4. **Consider the Timing** – Some packages are paid in a lump sum; others are spread over months. Decide which structure best supports your financial needs. |\n5. **Keep Documentation** – Retain copies of the severance agreement and any related correspondence. |\n\n---\n\n### Legal Landscape (U.S. Snapshot)\n\n| State | Severance Requirement | Notes |\n|-------|-----------------------|-------|\n| **California** | No statutory requirement; governed by contract or company policy. |\n| **New York** | No statutory requirement; however, the *New York State Labor Law* requires that severance be paid in a single lump sum if the employee is terminated. |\n| **Texas** | No statutory requirement; severance is typically a contractual or policy matter. |\n| **Federal** | The *Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act* requires a 60‑day notice for large layoffs, but does not mandate severance. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSeverance pay is a negotiated or policy‑driven payment that helps employees bridge the gap between jobs. Its size and terms depend on company policy, legal requirements, and the circumstances of the separation. Understanding the specifics of your severance package—and how it fits into your overall financial plan—is essential for a smooth transition.",

      "system_answer": "**Semiconductors** are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of conductors (like copper) and insulators (like glass). Their ability to conduct electricity can be precisely controlled, which makes them the foundation of modern electronics.\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Band gap** | Semiconductors have a small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can jump across this gap when energy (heat, light, or an electric field) is supplied. |\n| **Intrinsic vs. extrinsic** | *Intrinsic* semiconductors are pure (e.g., silicon, germanium). *Extrinsic* semiconductors are doped with small amounts of other elements to add free electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type), tailoring their conductivity. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common are crystalline solids (diamond‑cubic for Si, Ge, etc.) but amorphous forms (e.g., a‑Si) are also used. |\n| **Key materials** | Silicon (Si) – the workhorse of the industry; germanium (Ge); compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium phosphide (InP), silicon carbide (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN). |\n\n### Why they matter\n\n1. **Transistors** – The basic building block of CPUs, memory, and almost every digital device. A transistor uses a semiconductor to switch or amplify signals.\n2. **Diodes** – Allow current to flow in one direction; used in rectifiers, LEDs, solar cells, etc.\n3. **Integrated Circuits (ICs)** – Thousands to billions of transistors packed onto a single chip, enabling computers, smartphones, and countless other gadgets.\n4. **Photonic devices** – LEDs, laser diodes, photodiodes, and optical communication components rely on semiconductor physics.\n5. **Power electronics** – High‑power devices (IGBTs, MOSFETs) made from SiC or GaN can handle higher voltages and temperatures, improving efficiency in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and industrial drives.\n\n### How they work (simplified)\n\n- **Doping** introduces extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type).  \n- **PN junctions** (n‑type next to p‑type) form the core of diodes and transistors.  \n- Applying a voltage changes the width of the depletion region, controlling current flow.  \n- In a transistor, a small voltage at the gate (or base) controls a larger current between source/drain (or collector/emitter).\n\n### Everyday examples\n\n| Device | Semiconductor role |\n|--------|--------------------|\n| Smartphone | Si CMOS transistors, SiC power management |\n| LED light | GaN or AlGaInP diode |\n| Solar panel | Si or CdTe cells |\n| Electric‑vehicle charger | SiC MOSFETs |\n| Wi‑Fi router | Si RF transistors |\n\nIn short, semiconductors are engineered materials whose controllable electrical properties enable the vast array of electronic and photonic devices that power modern society.",

      "question": "What is a thermometer ?",
      "system_answer": "A **thermometer** is a device that measures temperature—the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance or environment. It works by converting a physical change that occurs in a material (such as expansion, electrical resistance, or voltage) into a readable scale.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Principle\n\nMost thermometers rely on one of the following physical properties that vary predictably with temperature:\n\n| Property | Typical Thermometer Type | How It Works |\n|----------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| **Thermal expansion** | Liquid‑filled glass (mercury or alcohol) | A liquid expands or contracts with temperature; the change in height is read on a calibrated scale. |\n| **Electrical resistance** | Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs), thermistors | The electrical resistance of a metal or semiconductor changes with temperature; a circuit measures this change. |\n| **Voltage change** | Thermocouples | Two different metals joined together produce a small voltage that varies with temperature. |\n| **Infrared radiation** | Infrared (IR) thermometers | Detects emitted IR radiation; the intensity correlates with temperature. |\n| **Optical/photonic** | Optical pyrometers | Measures the color (wavelength) of light emitted by hot objects. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Types\n\n| Type | Typical Use | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n|------|-------------|------------|---------------|\n| **Mercury‑in‑glass** | Laboratory, medical (historical) | High accuracy, linear response | Toxic, fragile, banned in many places |\n| **Alcohol (ethanol) glass** | Children’s thermometers, low‑cost | Safe, inexpensive | Less accurate, limited range |\n| **Digital (thermistor/RTD)** | Home, automotive, industrial | Fast, easy to read, can be digital | Requires power, may drift |\n| **Thermocouple** | Industrial, high‑temperature | Wide range, rugged, no power needed | Non‑linear, requires calibration |\n| **Infrared** | Medical, food safety, industrial | Non‑contact, instant | Requires line‑of‑sight, can be affected by emissivity |\n| **Optical pyrometer** | High‑temperature furnaces | Measures very high temps | Expensive, needs calibration |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Read a Thermometer\n\n1. **Identify the scale** (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, or a custom scale).  \n2. **Locate the measurement**:  \n   * For liquid‑filled: read the liquid level at the meniscus.  \n   * For digital: the display shows the temperature.  \n   * For thermocouple: read the gauge or digital readout.  \n3. **Account for calibration**: Some devices need a zero‑point adjustment or a calibration check.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Safety Tips\n\n- **Mercury thermometers**: If broken, collect the shards in a sealed container and dispose of them according to local hazardous‑waste regulations.  \n- **Alcohol thermometers**: Keep away from heat sources to avoid vapor ignition.  \n- **Infrared thermometers**: Ensure the target surface is clean and has a known emissivity; otherwise, the reading may be inaccurate.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick Reference\n\n| Temperature | Celsius (°C) | Fahrenheit (°F) | Kelvin (K) |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Freezing point of water | 0 | 32 | 273.15 |\n| Boiling point of water | 100 | 212 | 373.15 |\n| Human body temperature | 37 | 98.6 | 310.15 |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nA thermometer is a measurement instrument that translates a temperature‑dependent physical change into a readable value, allowing us to quantify how hot or cold something is. Whether you’re checking a fever, monitoring a furnace, or measuring the weather, the thermometer is the tool that turns invisible heat into a number you can act on.",

      "question": "What does `` Sitting Shiva '' mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sitting Shiva** is a traditional Jewish practice of mourning that takes place after the death of a close relative (usually a parent, spouse, child, sibling, or grandparent). The term comes from the Hebrew word *שִׁבְעָה* (*shivah*), meaning “seven,” because the mourning period lasts for seven days.\n\n### What it involves\n\n| Aspect | Typical practice |\n|--------|------------------|\n| **Location** | The mourner sits at home, often in a corner or a designated “shiva room.” |\n| **Duration** | 7 days, starting on the day of the funeral or burial. |\n| **Visitors** | Friends and family come to offer condolences, sit with the mourner, and share memories. |\n| **Atmosphere** | The space is kept quiet and subdued: lights are dimmed, no music or television, and sometimes a small candle is lit. |\n| **Food** | Meals are usually simple and often delivered by visitors or family members. |\n| **Activities** | The mourner may read the Torah, recite prayers, or simply sit in silence. |\n| **Restrictions** | Traditional observance includes refraining from certain pleasures (e.g., no dancing, no haircuts, no new clothes). |\n\n### Why it’s done\n\n- **Respect for the deceased**: The practice honors the life that has passed.\n- **Support for the bereaved**: The presence of friends and family provides emotional comfort.\n- **Community solidarity**: It reinforces communal bonds and shared values.\n\n### Cultural context\n\n- **Not a religious obligation**: While rooted in Jewish law, sitting shiva is more a cultural tradition than a strict religious commandment.\n- **Variations**: Some families observe a shorter or longer period, or adapt customs to fit modern lifestyles (e.g., allowing music or using a “shiva box” for visitors to leave messages).\n\nIn everyday English, “sitting shiva” simply means “to observe the traditional Jewish mourning period after a death.”",

      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal, degenerative brain disorder that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion**. Here’s a concise overview:\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **What it is** | A transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) caused by prions, which are misfolded forms of a normal cellular protein (PrP). |\n| **How it spreads** | In cattle, the most common route is through contaminated feed (e.g., protein meal made from infected animal parts). Prions are resistant to standard cooking, pasteurization, and many sterilization methods. |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | 1. **Early stage** – subtle changes in behavior, reduced milk production, weight loss.<br>2. **Late stage** – ataxia (loss of coordination), tremors, difficulty standing, loss of appetite, and eventual death. |\n| **Incubation period** | Typically 2–4 years, but can vary from 1 to 8 years. |\n| **Human risk** | The disease can be transmitted to humans through consumption of infected beef products, leading to **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**, a rare but invariably fatal neurological disorder. |\n| **Detection** | 1. **Post‑mortem** – brain tissue examination shows spongiform changes and prion accumulation.<br>2. **Ante‑mortem** – limited tests (e.g., blood, CSF) are under development; currently, surveillance relies on slaughter‑house inspections and testing of high‑risk tissues. |\n| **Control measures** | • **Feed bans**: prohibition of ruminant protein in animal feed.<br>• **Surveillance**: routine testing of cattle, especially those over 30 months.<br>• **Culling**: removal of infected or at‑risk animals.<br>• **Trace‑back**: tracking of animal products to prevent contaminated meat from reaching consumers. |\n| **Historical context** | First identified in the UK in 1986. The outbreak led to widespread culling of millions of cattle and significant changes in food‑safety regulations worldwide. |\n| **Current status** | BSE cases are now extremely rare in most countries due to stringent controls. However, ongoing surveillance remains essential to prevent re‑emergence. |\n\n**Key take‑away:** Mad cow disease is a prion‑based brain disorder in cattle that can, through contaminated beef, cause a fatal neurological disease in humans. It is preventable through strict feed‑regulation, surveillance, and culling practices.",

      "system_answer": "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel mixture that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is not fixed—it varies with the source, depth, and processing—but the bulk of the gas is made up of simple hydrocarbons and a few non‑hydrocarbon gases.  Below is a typical breakdown for *dry* natural gas (the form that is usually transported in pipelines) and a quick look at the “wet” or “raw” gas that comes straight from the well.\n\n| Component | Typical % of dry natural gas | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 85 – 95 % | The dominant component; the “fuel” that gives natural gas its energy content. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 3 – 10 % | Adds to calorific value; also a feedstock for petrochemicals. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Often separated for use as LPG. |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.1 – 1 % | Usually split into n‑butane and iso‑butane. |\n| **Pentanes & heavier (C₅⁺)** | < 0.5 % | Very small amounts; can be removed in processing. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑hydrocarbon; removed to meet pipeline specs. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Inert; reduces heating value. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.01 % (often < 1 ppm) | Toxic and corrosive; must be scrubbed. |\n| **Water vapor (H₂O)** | < 0.5 % | Condensed as liquid in pipelines; removed by dehydration. |\n| **Trace gases (CO, H₂, Ar, etc.)** | < 0.1 % | Minor contributors; usually removed or monitored. |\n\n### “Wet” or “Raw” Natural Gas\nWhen natural gas is first extracted, it often contains higher‑boiling hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, etc.) in larger proportions.  A typical raw‑gas composition might look like:\n\n- Methane: 70 – 80 %\n- Ethane: 10 – 15 %\n- Propane: 5 – 10 %\n- Butanes: 1 – 5 %\n- Pentanes & heavier: 0.5 – 2 %\n- CO₂, N₂, H₂S, water vapor: 5 – 10 %\n\nThese “wet” gases are processed in a **gas‑processing plant** to remove the heavier hydrocarbons (producing LPG or petrochemical feedstocks), scrub H₂S, and dry the gas before it is sent to pipelines.\n\n### Key Take‑aways\n\n1. **Methane dominates** – it is the primary energy source.  \n2. **Ethane, propane, and butanes** are present in smaller but significant amounts and are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks.  \n3. **Non‑hydrocarbon gases** (CO₂, N₂, H₂S, water vapor) are impurities that must be removed or controlled to meet pipeline specifications and safety standards.  \n4. The exact percentages vary by field, but the above ranges give a good sense of what “natural gas” typically contains.",
