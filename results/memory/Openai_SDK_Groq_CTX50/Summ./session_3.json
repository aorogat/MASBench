Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "Learning a new language is a rewarding but complex endeavor. The “best” approach depends on your goals, learning style, schedule, and the language itself, but most experts agree that a **balanced, immersive, and consistent** strategy works best. Below is a practical roadmap that blends proven techniques, tools, and habits you can adapt to any language.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Set Clear, Measurable Goals\n\n| Goal | Why It Matters | How to Measure |\n|------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Functional Fluency** (e.g., travel, work) | Keeps you motivated and gives you a target to aim for | Can you order food, ask for directions, or hold a 5‑minute conversation? |\n| **Academic/Professional Proficiency** | Requires deeper grammar, vocabulary, and writing skills | Pass a proficiency test (TOEFL, DELE, JLPT, etc.) |\n| **Cultural Immersion** | Language is inseparable from culture | Can you understand native media, idioms, and humor? |\n\nWrite your goals down, break them into milestones (e.g., “Speak 5 minutes with a native in 3 months”), and review them weekly.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build a Strong Foundation\n\n### 2.1. Start with Core Vocabulary & Phrases\n\n- **Use spaced‑repetition systems (SRS)**: Anki, Memrise, or Quizlet. Aim for 20–30 new words/day, spaced over weeks.\n- **Focus on high‑frequency words**: 1,000–2,000 words cover ~80 % of everyday conversation.\n- **Learn phrases, not isolated words**: “How much does this cost?” is more useful than “cost” alone.\n\n### 2.2. Master Pronunciation Early\n\n- **Phonetics**: Use IPA charts or YouTube videos to hear the exact sounds.\n- **Shadowing**: Repeat after native speakers, mimicking rhythm and intonation.\n- **Record yourself**: Compare with native audio; adjust as needed.\n\n### 2.3. Get the Grammar Skeleton\n\n- **Start with the “big picture”**: Sentence structure, verb conjugations, and common tenses.\n- **Use a beginner textbook or app**: Duolingo, Babbel, or a structured course (e.g., “Assimil” or “Pimsleur”).\n- **Practice with simple sentences**: Write 10–15 sentences a day using new grammar points.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Immersion & Exposure\n\n| Method | What It Does | Tips |\n|--------|--------------|------|\n| **Listening** | Builds ear for rhythm, intonation, and vocabulary | Podcasts, music, news, movies with subtitles |\n| **Reading** | Expands vocabulary, reinforces grammar | Children’s books, graded readers, news sites |\n| **Speaking** | Develops fluency, confidence | Language exchange, tutors, conversation clubs |\n| **Writing** | Consolidates grammar, improves recall | Journal, social media posts, language forums |\n\n**Daily Routine (≈1 hour)**\n\n1. **5 min** – Review flashcards (SRS).  \n2. **10 min** – Listen to a podcast or song.  \n3. **10 min** – Read a short article or story.  \n4. **10 min** – Write a short diary entry or reply to a forum post.  \n5. **15 min** – Speak with a partner or tutor (structured or free).  \n\nAdjust the times to fit your schedule; consistency beats intensity.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Leverage Technology Wisely\n\n| Tool | Strength | How to Use |\n|------|----------|------------|\n| **Anki** | Customizable SRS | Create decks for vocabulary, grammar, and idioms. |\n| **HelloTalk / Tandem** | Native conversation | Chat with native speakers; use voice notes. |\n| **italki / Preply** | One‑on‑one tutoring | Schedule 30‑minute lessons focused on weak areas. |\n| **Speech‑Recognition Apps** | Pronunciation feedback | Use tools like ELSA Speak or Rosetta Stone. |\n| **Language‑learning Platforms** | Structured courses | Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, or university MOOCs. |\n\n**Pro Tip**: Combine a structured app for basics with a native‑speaker interaction for real‑world practice.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practice Speaking Early and Often\n\n- **Shadowing**: Repeat after audio clips, matching speed and intonation.  \n- **Language Exchange**: Find a partner who wants to learn your language.  \n- **Speak to Yourself**: Narrate your day in the target language.  \n- **Use “Speak‑Only” Days**: Dedicate a day each week to speaking only in the target language (even if you’re alone).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Write Regularly\n\n- **Start a Journal**: Write 3–5 sentences daily.  \n- **Use Language Forums**: Post questions on Reddit’s r/LanguageLearning or language‑specific subreddits.  \n- **Get Feedback**: Ask native speakers to correct your writing.  \n- **Rewrite**: Take a paragraph from a news article and rewrite it in your own words.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Immerse Yourself Culturally\n\n- **Watch TV/Movies**: Start with subtitles in your native language, then switch to subtitles in the target language, and finally no subtitles.  \n- **Read Books**: Begin with children’s books, then move to novels.  \n- **Listen to Music**: Translate lyrics; sing along.  \n- **Cook Recipes**: Follow recipes in the target language.  \n- **Travel**: If possible, spend time in a country where the language is spoken.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Monitor Progress & Adjust\n\n- **Track Vocabulary**: Keep a log of words learned and review frequency.  \n- **Set Mini‑Tests**: Every 2–4 weeks, take a short quiz on vocabulary, grammar, and listening.  \n- **Reflect**: Ask yourself what’s working and what’s not.  \n- **Adjust**: If you’re stuck, switch tools or methods (e.g., move from Duolingo to a textbook).\n\n---\n\n## 9. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n| Pitfall | Why It’s Problematic | Fix |\n|---------|---------------------|-----|\n| **Over‑reliance on translation** | Slows down thinking in the target language | Practice “thinking in the language” by describing your surroundings. |\n| **Skipping speaking** | Fluency suffers | Prioritize speaking from day one. |\n| **Neglecting listening** | Hard to understand native speakers | Incorporate audio daily. |\n| **Burnout from too much study** | Leads to quitting | Mix study with fun activities (games, music). |\n| **Ignoring culture** | Language is cultural; missing context | Engage with media, food, traditions. |\n\n---\n\n## 10. Sample 3‑Month Plan (Beginner)\n\n| Week | Focus | Activities |\n|------|-------|------------|\n| 1–2 | Core vocab & pronunciation | Anki 20 words/day, shadowing 5 min/day |\n| 3–4 | Basic grammar & simple sentences | Duolingo lessons, write 5 sentences |\n| 5–6 | Listening & speaking | 10 min podcast, 15 min language exchange |\n| 7–8 | Reading & writing | Read a children’s book, journal 3 days |\n| 9–10 | Cultural immersion | Watch a movie, cook a recipe |\n| 11–12 | Consolidation | Take a mock test, review weak spots |\n\n---\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\n**The best way to learn a new language is to treat it as a living skill, not a textbook exercise.** Combine:\n\n1. **Consistent, spaced learning** (SRS, daily practice).  \n2. **Active use** (speaking, writing, listening).  \n3. **Cultural immersion** (media, food, people).  \n4. **Feedback loops** (tutors, native speakers, self‑assessment).\n\nStick to a routine, celebrate small wins, and stay curious. Over time, the language will become a natural part of your daily life. Happy learning!",
      "gold_answer": "Kiara, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Kiara, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze. One night, after an altercation with Blaze, Kiara’s sister, known as Mrs. Stevie, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Kiara suspects that Blaze was responsible for the attack.\n\nOne day a lawyer named Dilan appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Kiara a large fortune, and Kiara must come to Nigeria immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Kiara happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Kiley is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Ernest.\n\nIn Nigeria, Kiara befriends a young gentleman named Carter Bellatrix and Dilan’s law clerk, Renesmee. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Stevie, but he continues to pine after Ernest. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Bellatrix, Carter’s father. Carter himself helps Kiara learn how to act like a gentleman. When Kiara turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Carter buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Carter and Kiara lead a fairly undisciplined life in Nigeria, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Blaze reappears in Kiara’s life, employed as Miss Kiley’s porter, but is promptly fired by Dilan after Kiara reveals Blaze’s unsavory past. Mrs. Stevie dies, and Kiara goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Kiara’s room—the convict, Becky, who stuns Kiara by announcing that he, not Miss Kiley, is the source of Kiara’s fortune. He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Kiara discovers that Norbert was the man who abandoned Miss Kiley at the altar and that Ernest is Becky’s daughter. Miss Kiley has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Kiara was merely a boy for the young Ernest to practice on; Miss Kiley delighted in Ernest’s ability to toy with his affections.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Kiara sees the good in Becky and begins to care for him deeply. Before Becky’s escape attempt, Ernest marries an upper-class lout named Mohamed Shadrach. Kiara makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Kiley begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Kiara’s forgiveness.\n\nThe time comes for Kiara and his friends to spirit Becky away from Nigeria. Just before the escape attempt, Kiara is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Blaze. Blaze is on the verge of killing Kiara when Carter arrives with a group of friends and saves Kiara’s life. Kiara and Carter hurry back to effect Becky’s escape. They try to sneak Becky down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Norbert tipped off. Becky and Norbert fight in the river, and Norbert is drowned. Becky is sentenced to death, and Kiara loses his fortune. Becky feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Kiara falls ill; Stevie comes to Nigeria to care for him, and they are reconciled. Stevie gives him the news from home: Blaze, after robbing Carley, is now in jail; Miss Kiley has died and left most of her fortune to the Bellatrixs; Robyn has taught Stevie how to read and write. After Stevie leaves, Kiara decides to rush home after him and marry Robyn, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Stevie have already married.\n\nKiara decides to go abroad with Carter to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Ernest in the ruined garden at Satis House. Shadrach, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Kiara finds that Ernest’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Kiara believing that they will never part again. ",
