      "system_answer": "### 1. Do Your Homework First\n\n| What to Research | Why It Matters | How to Do It |\n|------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Model & Trim** | Different trims have different prices, features, and depreciation curves. | Use the manufacturer’s website, consumer reports, and sites like Edmunds or Kelley Blue Book. |\n| **MSRP vs. Invoice** | MSRP is the sticker price; invoice is what the dealer pays. Knowing the gap helps you negotiate. | Look up the “invoice price” on sites like Edmunds or TrueCar. |\n| **Current Incentives** | Manufacturers often run rebates, low‑APR financing, or lease specials. | Check the manufacturer’s “Incentives” page and local dealership sites. |\n| **Depreciation & Resale Value** | Some cars hold value better, saving you money in the long run. | Look at NADA Guides or Kelley Blue Book for projected resale values. |\n| **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** | Fuel, insurance, maintenance, and taxes can add up. | Use TCO calculators on Edmunds or Consumer Reports. |\n\n> **Tip:** Keep a spreadsheet or a note app to compare at least 3–5 models and trims.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Timing Is Everything\n\n| When to Buy | Why It Works | Practical Steps |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **End of the Month/Quarter** | Dealers have sales quotas and may be more willing to cut a deal. | Call ahead to ask if they’re close to a quota. |\n| **End of the Model Year** | New models arrive, so dealers want to clear inventory. | Look for “last‑year” models; they often have significant discounts. |\n| **Holiday Sales Events** | Presidents’ Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Christmas often bring promotions. | Check dealership calendars and manufacturer press releases. |\n| **When a New Model Is Announced** | Older models drop in price. | Follow automotive news sites or subscribe to newsletters. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Secure Financing Beforehand\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | How to Get It |\n|--------|------|------|---------------|\n| **Bank or Credit Union Loan** | Often lower rates than dealer finance. | Requires pre‑approval paperwork. | Apply online or in‑branch; bring your credit report. |\n| **Dealer Financing** | Convenient; sometimes offers 0% APR. | May have higher rates or hidden fees. | Compare the dealer’s rate to your pre‑approved rate. |\n| **Lease** | Lower monthly payments; can drive a newer car every few years. | Mileage limits, wear‑and‑tear fees. | Use lease calculators to see if it fits your driving habits. |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Bring a copy of your pre‑approved loan or lease offer to the dealership. It gives you a benchmark and shows you’re serious.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Trade‑In Strategy\n\n| What to Do | Why It Helps | How to Execute |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Get a Trade‑In Quote Separately** | Dealers may inflate the trade‑in value to offset a higher car price. | Use sites like Kelley Blue Book or NADA to estimate your trade‑in value. |\n| **Negotiate the Trade‑In After the Car Price** | Keeps the numbers separate and prevents confusion. | Tell the dealer you’re ready to discuss the trade‑in only after you agree on the car’s price. |\n| **Consider Selling Privately** | You can often get 10–20% more than a dealer. | List on AutoTrader, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. The Negotiation Playbook\n\n1. **Start with the Invoice Price**  \n   - Aim for a price close to the invoice, not the MSRP.  \n   - If you’re buying a new car, the dealer’s profit margin is usually 2–5% above invoice.\n\n2. **Use “Hold” and “Walk Away” Tactics**  \n   - If the dealer can’t meet your target, say you’ll walk away.  \n   - Often they’ll call you back with a better offer.\n\n3. **Ask for “All‑Inclusive” Pricing**  \n   - Get a single number that includes taxes, title, dealer fees, and any add‑ons.  \n   - This prevents surprise add‑ons at the end.\n\n4. **Leverage Competing Quotes**  \n   - Bring quotes from other dealers.  \n   - Dealers may match or beat the best offer to win your business.\n\n5. **Be Prepared to Say “No” to Add‑Ons**  \n   - Extended warranties, paint protection, and other add‑ons can inflate the price.  \n   - Decide in advance which add‑ons you truly need.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Final Checklist Before Signing\n\n| Item | Why It Matters | How to Verify |\n|------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Price Breakdown** | Confirms you’re paying what you agreed. | Ask for a printed copy of the final invoice. |\n| **Financing Terms** | Ensures the APR and loan length match your agreement. | Double‑check the loan amount, interest rate, and monthly payment. |\n| **Warranty & Service Plans** | Avoids hidden costs. | Verify the warranty period and what’s covered. |\n| **Vehicle History (if used)** | Confirms no hidden damage or title issues. | Get a Carfax or AutoCheck report. |\n| **Test Drive & Inspection** | Confirms the car’s condition. | Take a full test drive; check for any mechanical issues. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Resources & Tools\n\n| Resource | What It Offers | How to Use |\n|----------|----------------|------------|\n| **Edmunds** | MSRP, invoice, incentives, TCO calculators | Search for your model, compare prices. |\n| **Kelley Blue Book** | Trade‑in values, dealer invoice, consumer reviews | Use for trade‑in negotiations. |\n| **TrueCar** | Real‑world pricing data | See what others paid in your area. |\n| **Manufacturer’s Incentives Page** | Current rebates, low‑APR offers | Check before visiting a dealer. |\n| **Bank/Credit Union Online Loan Calculator** | Pre‑approval rates | Get a rate estimate before heading to the dealership. |\n| **AutoTrader, Cars.com** | Private sale listings | Compare dealer prices to private sale prices. |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Quick “Deal‑Getting” Checklist\n\n1. **Research 3–5 models & trims.**  \n2. **Check incentives & financing options.**  \n3. **Get pre‑approved loan or lease offer.**  \n4. **Obtain trade‑in quotes.**  \n5. **Visit dealership at the end of a sales period.**  \n6. **Negotiate the car price first, then the trade‑in.**  \n7. **Ask for a single, all‑inclusive price.**  \n8. **Review the final paperwork thoroughly.**  \n9. **Sign only if all terms match your agreement.**\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Know the numbers** (MSRP, invoice, incentives, TCO).  \n- **Secure financing** before you go to the dealer.  \n- **Negotiate separately** for the car and the trade‑in.  \n- **Use timing** (end of month, end of model year, holiday sales).  \n- **Stay firm** and be ready to walk away if the deal isn’t right.\n\nFollow these steps, and you’ll maximize your chances of getting a great deal on a new car. Happy car hunting! 🚗💨",

      "system_answer": "**Broad vs. Wide – a quick guide**\n\n| Word | Typical nuance | When it feels most natural | Example |\n|------|----------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| **Broad** | Emphasises *diversity* or *variety* across categories or dimensions. Think “wide in scope.” | When you want to stress that the options cover many different kinds or aspects. | “The company offers a **broad range of options** for remote work, from full‑time telecommuting to flexible hybrid schedules.” |\n| **Wide** | Emphasises *quantity* or *extent* along a single dimension. Think “spanning a large area.” | When you want to stress that there are many choices, even if they’re all within the same category. | “The store has a **wide range of options** for organic snacks, from nuts to dried fruit.” |\n\n### Why the difference matters\n\n- **Broad** → *many different types*  \n  - “A broad range of options” suggests you can pick from several distinct categories (e.g., different payment methods, delivery times, product lines).  \n  - It’s often used with abstract or conceptual ranges: *broad range of skills*, *broad range of opinions*.\n\n- **Wide** → *many choices within one category*  \n  - “A wide range of options” suggests a large number of choices that are similar in nature (e.g., many flavors of the same product).  \n  - It’s common with physical or measurable ranges: *wide range of sizes*, *wide range of colors*.\n\n### Synonyms that hint at the nuance\n\n| Broad | Wide |\n|-------|------|\n| extensive, diverse, varied, comprehensive | extensive, expansive, large, plentiful |\n| broad spectrum, broad selection | wide array, wide assortment, wide spread |\n\n### Quick test\n\n1. **“We have a ___ range of options for customizing your laptop.”**  \n   - *Broad* (different customization categories: CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, etc.)  \n   - *Wide* (many choices within one category, e.g., many RAM sizes).\n\n2. **“The conference covered a ___ range of topics.”**  \n   - *Broad* (many distinct topics: AI, sustainability, policy, etc.)  \n   - *Wide* (many subtopics within a single field, e.g., many AI subfields).\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- Use **broad** when you want to highlight *variety* across different kinds of options.  \n- Use **wide** when you want to highlight *numerous* options that are largely similar.\n\nBoth are correct in many contexts, but the subtle shift in emphasis can make your description feel more precise.",
