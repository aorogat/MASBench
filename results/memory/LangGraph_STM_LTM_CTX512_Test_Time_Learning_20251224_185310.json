The closest is *The Godfather Part III* (1990) or *The Godfather: Part II* (1974). If you’re looking for a sequel, *The Godfather Part II* is a great follow‑up to the original.\n\n---\n\n#### Suggested order to watch\n\n1. **The Godfather** (start with the original—it's the cornerstone).  \n2. **Goodfellas** (for a different, more modern take).  \n3. **The Irishman** (if you want a reflective, long‑form story).  \n\nIf you’re in the mood for something a bit lighter but still serious, *The Untouchables* is a solid choice.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Titanic refresher\n\nSince you’re thinking about re‑watching *Titanic*, it’s a great idea to pair it with a classic mob film for a full “old‑school” movie marathon. Maybe start with *The Godfather*, then finish the night with *Titanic*—both are epic in their own right.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you want a different genre!

        "Absolutely—both *A Nightmare on Elm Street* (1984) and *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge* (1985) are classic horror films that definitely fall into the “scary” category. They’re known for their creepy dream‑world sequences, the iconic Freddy Krueger character, and a mix of supernatural terror with a bit of teen angst.\n\n**Quick rundown:**\n\n| Film | What makes it scary |\n|------|---------------------|\n| *A Nightmare on Elm Street* (1984) | Freddy’s razor‑sharp glove, the surreal dream‑world, and the way the film blurs the line between reality and nightmare. |\n| *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge* (1985) | Builds on the first film’s dread but adds a darker, more psychological tone—Freddy’s influence over the protagonist’s body and mind. |\n\nIf you enjoyed the new *It* (2017) and are looking for more horror that balances scares with a strong narrative, you might also like:\n\n- **The Others** (2001) – atmospheric, twisty, and chilling.  \n- **The Ring** (2002) – a creepy, slow‑burn supernatural thriller.  \n- **The Babadook** (2014) – psychological horror with a haunting atmosphere.  \n- **Hereditary** (2018) – intense, unsettling, and very effective at building dread.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like more recommendations or if there’s a particular sub‑genre (e.g., supernatural, slasher, psychological) you’re leaning toward!"

The plot twists keep you guessing, much like *Gone Girl*. |\n| 2 | **Nightcrawler** | 2014 | A dark, stylish look at the underbelly of crime‑reporting. The protagonist’s moral descent is gripping and the pacing is relentless. |\n| 3 | **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo** | 2011 | A gripping mystery‑thriller with a strong female lead, plenty of twists, and a moody atmosphere. |\n| 4 | **Wind River** | 2017 | A chilling crime‑thriller set in a remote Native‑American reservation. The tension builds slowly, and the ending is surprisingly gut‑wrenching. |\n| 5 | **The Invisible Guest** (La Cita Invisible) | 2016 | A Spanish thriller that plays with unreliable narration and a complex plot. It’s a great international option if you’re open to subtitles. |\n| 6 | **The Handmaiden** | 2016 | A Korean psychological thriller that blends romance, deception, and a masterful twist. It’s visually stunning and narratively intricate. |\n| 7 | **Gone Baby Gone** | 2007 | If you liked *Gone Girl*, this one’s a similar “cat‑and‑mouse” thriller with a strong female lead and plenty of plot twists. |\n| 8 | **The Departed** | 2006 | A crime thriller with a cat‑and‑mouse dynamic between cops and gangsters. The twists are sharp, and the pacing is tight. |\n| 9 | **The Silence of the Lambs** | 1991 | A classic psychological thriller that blends horror and crime. The cat‑and‑mouse chase between Clarice and Hannibal is unforgettable. |\n|10 | **The Night House** | 2020 | A modern psychological thriller with a haunting atmosphere and a twist that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll. |\n\n**Quick Tips for Picking One:**\n\n- **If you want a *psychological* twist** – go for *Nightcrawler*, *The Invisible Guest*, or *The Handmaiden*.\n- **If you prefer a *crime‑drama* with a cat‑and‑mouse vibe** – try *Prisoners*, *Gone Baby Gone*, or *The Departed*.\n- **If you’re open to international films** – *The Handmaiden* (Korean) and *The Invisible Guest* (Spanish) are both excellent.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re looking for something in a specific sub‑genre (e.g., psychological horror, action‑thriller, etc.).

Lots of jokes, a bit of action, and a fun “lost‑treasure” plot. |\n| 2022 | **The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** | Nicolas Cage plays a fictionalized version of himself, and the film is a meta‑comedy with a superhero‑style twist. |\n| 2022 | **The Adam Project** | A sci‑fi comedy‑adventure starring Ryan Reynolds.

Jackson.  Lots of jokes and high‑octane set pieces. |\n| 2016 | **The Nice Guys** | A neo‑noir comedy‑crime film starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe.

Hope you choose one of these to enjoy. I might check out a few of them myself\nUser: I'm feeling childish, so I think I will check out Shrek (2001). There's not too many fart jokes in it, is it? Eddie Murphy better be worth it.\nSystem: ",

        "Hey there! 🎬\n\n**Shrek (2001)** is a great pick for a light‑hearted, “childish” vibe. Here’s the scoop:\n\n| Topic | What to Expect |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Fart jokes** | Shrek has a few playful, cartoon‑style gags (think the “Donkey’s” goofy antics), but it’s not a movie that relies on explicit or frequent fart humor. It stays pretty family‑friendly. |\n| **Eddie Murphy** | He voices **Donkey**, the lovable sidekick. His comedic timing is spot‑on—think a mix of “The Simpsons” and “The Fresh Prince.” If you’re a fan of his stand‑up or movies like *Coming to America*, you’ll definitely enjoy his performance. |\n| **Tone** | It’s a blend of fairy‑tale parody, slapstick, and heartfelt moments. The humor is broad but not crude, so it’s safe for most audiences. |\n\n**If you’re looking for something in the same vein** (family‑friendly, comedic, with a bit of irreverence), you might also like:\n\n- **The Princess Bride (1987)** – a classic fairy‑tale adventure with witty banter.  \n- **Monsters, Inc. (2001)** – Pixar’s take on a monster world with plenty of laughs.  \n- **Despicable Me (2010)** – a goofy villain‑turned‑dad story with a lovable minion sidekick.  \n\nEnjoy your movie night! Let me know if you’d like another recommendation or a different genre."

        "Hey! I’m doing great—thanks for asking. How about you?  \n\nIf you’re into the surreal, unsettling vibe of **Eraserhead**, here are a few films that capture that Lynchian spirit:\n\n| Film | Why it’s similar |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Blue Velvet (1986)** – Lynch’s own follow‑up. It’s a dark, dream‑like noir that dives into the underbelly of suburbia. |\n| **Mulholland Drive (2001)** – Another Lynch masterpiece, a mind‑bending mystery that blurs reality and fantasy. |\n| **Lost Highway (1997)** – Lynch’s most experimental feature, with a fractured narrative and eerie atmosphere. |\n| **The Elephant Man (1980)** – David Lynch’s early work, a haunting, visually striking biopic that feels almost surreal. |\n| **The Holy Mountain (1973)** – Alejandro Jodorowsky’s psychedelic, symbolic masterpiece—think Lynch meets surrealist art. |\n| **The Cell (2000)** – A psychological thriller with striking visuals and a dream‑like structure. |\n| **Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)** – The pre‑series film that dives deep into the bizarre world of Twin Peaks. |\n| **The Lobster (2015)** – Yorgos Lanthimos’ absurd, dystopian satire that feels oddly Lynchian in its oddity. |\n| **The Fall (2006)** | Tarsem Singh’s visually lush, story‑torn fantasy that feels like a dreamscape. |\n\nIf you’d like more suggestions—maybe something a bit less mainstream or a specific sub‑genre—just let me know!

        "Sounds like you’re into tight, tension‑driven thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat without going overboard on gore. Here are a few suspense‑heavy, home‑invasion or “house‑on‑the‑line” movies that should fit the bill:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it fits |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| **The Strangers** | 2008 | A quiet suburban home is invaded by masked intruders. It’s all about the psychological terror, not gore. |\n| **The Invitation** | 2015 | A dinner party turns sinister. The suspense builds slowly, and the climax is more mind‑bending than blood‑thirsty. |\n| **The Others** | 2001 | A family in a remote house faces unsettling events. It’s atmospheric and creepy, with a twist that keeps you guessing. |\n| **The Lodge** | 2019 | A family is trapped in a remote cabin during a snowstorm. The tension is psychological, with a chilling atmosphere. |\n| **The House of the Devil** | 2009 | A babysitter takes a job in a creepy house. The film is a slow‑burn horror‑thriller that relies on dread rather than gore. |\n| **The Vanishing** (also known as *The Vanishing* or *The Vanishing* 1988) | 1988 | A couple’s car breaks down in a remote area and they’re stalked by a mysterious figure. It’s a classic suspense thriller. |\n| **The Dark Half** | 1993 | A writer’s alter‑ego threatens his family. It’s more psychological horror than gore. |\n| **The Eye** | 2008 | A woman gets a corneal transplant and starts seeing terrifying visions. The suspense is built around the unknown. |\n| **The House on Haunted Hill** | 1959 | A classic haunted house story that relies on atmosphere and tension rather than gore. |\n| **The Haunting of Hill House** (TV series, 2018) | 2018 | If you’re open to a series, this is a masterclass in psychological suspense and family drama. |\n\n**Quick Tips for Watching Suspense Thrillers:**\n\n1. **Keep the lights low** – a dim environment heightens the tension.  \n2. **Pause for a breath** – if a scene feels too intense, pause, stretch, and come back.  \n3. **Watch with a friend** – sharing the suspense can make it more fun and less scary.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like more recommendations, or if you’re looking for something in a different sub‑genre (e.g., psychological thrillers, crime‑drama, or a mix of action and suspense).

      "question": "i need a recipe for chicken cordon bleu",
      "system_answer": [
        "Here’s a classic, crowd‑pleasing recipe for **Chicken Cordon Bleu**. It’s simple, flavorful, and perfect for a week‑night dinner or a special occasion.\n\n---\n\n## Ingredients\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts | 4 | Flattened to 1/2‑inch thickness |\n| Swiss cheese slices | 4 | (or Gruyère, provolone, or a mix) |\n| Cooked ham slices | 4 | Thin, deli‑style or thinly sliced cooked ham |\n| All‑purpose flour | 1/4 cup | For dusting |\n| Eggs | 2 | Beaten |\n| Bread crumbs | 1 cup | (Panko or regular) |\n| Olive oil or melted butter | 2 Tbsp | For cooking |\n| Salt | 1/2 tsp | |\n| Black pepper | 1/4 tsp | |\n| Optional: Dijon mustard or mayonnaise | 1 Tbsp | For a little extra flavor |\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Prep the chicken**  \n   - Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper.  \n   - Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch.  \n   - Season both sides lightly with salt and pepper.\n\n2. **Assemble the roulades**  \n   - Lay a slice of ham on each breast, then a slice of cheese on top of the ham.  \n   - Roll the breast tightly, securing with a toothpick or kitchen twine if needed.\n\n3. **Dredge the rolls**  \n   - Set up a dredging station:  \n     1. Flour in a shallow dish.  \n     2. Beaten eggs in another shallow dish.  \n     3. Bread crumbs in a third shallow dish.  \n   - Coat each chicken roll first in flour, shaking off excess.  \n   - Dip in the beaten eggs, then coat with bread crumbs.  \n   - For extra crunch, you can double‑coat: repeat the egg and breadcrumb step.\n\n4. **Cook**  \n   - Heat the olive oil or melted butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  \n   - Add the chicken rolls, skin‑side down if you used skin, and cook for 3–4 minutes per side, until golden brown.  \n   - Transfer the browned rolls to a preheated oven at 375 °F (190 °C) and bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C) and the cheese is melted.\n\n5. **Serve**  \n   - Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing.  \n   - Serve with a simple side such as roasted potatoes, a green salad, or steamed asparagus.  \n   - If you like, drizzle a little melted butter or a squeeze of lemon over the top for extra brightness.\n\n---\n\n### Tips & Variations\n\n- **Cheese & Ham Choices**: Swiss is classic, but Gruyère, provolone, or even a sharp cheddar can work. For a different flavor, try smoked ham or turkey ham.\n- **Breadcrumbs**: Panko gives a lighter, crunchier coating. For a gluten‑free version, use gluten‑free breadcrumbs or crushed cornflakes.\n- **Sauce**: A quick pan sauce can elevate the dish. After removing the chicken, deglaze the skillet with a splash of white wine or chicken broth, add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, and whisk until thickened. Pour over the sliced chicken.\n- **Make‑Ahead**: Assemble the rolls ahead of time and refrigerate (up to 24 h). Just add the coating and cook as directed.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu! If you have any questions or want a side‑dish suggestion, just let me know."

Each enzyme is highly specific for its substrate(s) and can be regulated by various mechanisms (inhibition, activation, allosteric control, etc.) to maintain the proper balance of biochemical pathways."

      "system_answer": [
        "The Sun itself does not have a “yellow” color—it emits a broad spectrum of light that is essentially **white** (or very slightly yellow‑ish in the visible range).  The reason we normally see it as yellow (or sometimes orange or red) is due to the way Earth’s atmosphere interacts with that light.\n\n### 1. The Sun’s intrinsic spectrum  \n- The Sun is a hot, roughly 5,800 K black‑body radiator.  \n- Its spectrum peaks in the green‑yellow part of the visible range, but it emits strongly across the entire visible spectrum (and beyond into UV and IR).  \n- If you could view the Sun from space, or from a high‑altitude balloon, it would appear almost white.\n\n### 2. Atmospheric scattering (Rayleigh scattering)  \n- As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered in all directions by air molecules and small particles.  \n- The longer‑wavelength light (yellow, orange, red) travels more directly to the observer.  \n- When the Sun is high in the sky, the path through the atmosphere is short, so the blue light is only slightly scattered and the Sun looks white or very pale yellow.  \n- When the Sun is near the horizon (sunrise/sunset), the light must pass through a much thicker layer of air, scattering away most of the blue light and leaving the longer wavelengths, so the Sun appears orange or red.\n\n### 3. Human perception and color mixing  \n- Our eyes are more sensitive to green and yellow wavelengths, so a mixture of all colors (white) can appear slightly yellowish to us.  \n- The sky itself is blue because of the same scattering, and the Sun’s light is the dominant source of that scattered light.\n\n### 4. Other factors  \n- **Atmospheric pollution** or aerosols can enhance scattering, sometimes making the Sun look more orange or reddish.  \n- **Solar activity** (sunspots, flares) can slightly alter the Sun’s spectral output, but the effect on perceived color is negligible for everyday observation.\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is essentially white; it looks yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters away the blue part of its spectrum, leaving the longer wavelengths that dominate the visible light we receive."

        "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, and many other livestock species.  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | A picornavirus of the *Pestivirus* genus (seven serotypes: O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed or equipment, aerosol spread over short distances, and occasionally via insects or fomites. |\n| **Clinical signs** | Fever, lameness, swelling of the feet and mouth, ulcerative lesions on the tongue, lips, and inside the mouth, and in some species, vesicles on the teats or hooves. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from decreased milk and meat production, trade restrictions, culling of infected and exposed animals, and costs of vaccination and biosecurity. |\n| **Control measures** | Strict movement controls, quarantine, culling of infected and exposed animals, vaccination (where available), and rigorous sanitation of equipment and facilities. |\n| **Global status** | FMD is endemic in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, while it is largely eradicated in North America and much of Europe. International trade is heavily regulated to prevent spread. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters in the mouths and hooves of livestock, leading to significant animal welfare and economic concerns worldwide."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in air, in some cases).  \n\n- **How it works**: A sonar system emits a sound pulse (the “ping”) into the medium. When that pulse encounters an object, it reflects back. The system measures the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal.  \n- **Key functions**:  \n  - **Detection**: Finding objects (e.g., fish, submarines, underwater terrain).  \n  - **Range**: Calculating distance based on echo travel time.  \n  - **Bearing**: Determining direction of the target.  \n  - **Imaging**: Creating maps or images of underwater structures (e.g., side‑scan sonar).  \n- **Types**:  \n  - **Active sonar** – emits pulses and listens for echoes.  \n  - **Passive sonar** – listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships).  \n- **Applications**: Navigation, depth sounding, fish-finding, submarine detection, underwater archaeology, and scientific research."

It’s often accompanied by a range of other symptoms, such as:\n\n| Symptom | Typical description |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain that lasts at least three months and is felt on both sides of the body and above and below the waist. |\n| **Tender points** | Specific spots on the body (e.g., neck, shoulders, hips) that are especially painful when pressed. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Trouble falling or staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive issues** | “Fibro fog” – problems with concentration, memory, and mental clarity. |\n| **Headaches** | Migraines or tension‑type headaches are common. |\n| **Mood changes** | Anxiety, depression, or irritability. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Irritable bowel syndrome, numbness/tingling, and sensitivity to temperature or noise. |\n\n### What causes it?\nThe exact cause isn’t fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute:\n\n1. **Central nervous system sensitivity** – The brain and spinal cord may amplify pain signals.\n2. **Genetics** – A family history can increase risk.\n3. **Physical or emotional trauma** – Injury, stress, or major life events can trigger or worsen symptoms.\n4. **Infections** – Some cases follow viral or bacterial infections.\n\n### Diagnosis\nBecause there’s no single test, doctors diagnose fibromyalgia by:\n\n- **Medical history** and symptom review.\n- **Physical exam** to check for tender points.\n- **Rule‑out** other conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).\n\n### Treatment\nThere’s no cure, but many people find relief with a combination of:\n\n- **Medications** (pain relievers, antidepressants, anti‑seizure drugs).\n- **Lifestyle changes** (regular exercise, stress‑management, good sleep hygiene).\n- **Therapies** (physical therapy, cognitive‑behavioral therapy, acupuncture).\n- **Support** (patient education, support groups).\n\nFibromyalgia is a real, often debilitating condition, but with proper management many people can lead active, fulfilling lives."

If the better eye is 20/200 or worse, the person is considered legally blind, regardless of field loss.  \n2. If the acuity is better than 20/200, the visual field is checked. If the field is 20° or less, the person is also considered legally blind.  \n3. If neither criterion is met, the person is not legally blind, even if they have significant vision loss.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Eligibility for services**: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), state vision‑screening programs, and many other benefits use this definition.  \n- **Legal protection**: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other laws use the same standard to determine disability status.  \n- **Insurance and medical billing**: Some insurance plans and medical billing codes use the 20/200 or 20° field thresholds to classify blindness for coverage purposes.\n\n**Note on variations**\n\n- Some states or countries use slightly different thresholds (e.g., 20/400 or 20° field) or add additional criteria such as contrast sensitivity.  \n- The definition is intended for *functional* blindness, not for diagnosing a specific eye disease.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA person is legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity in the better eye is 20/200 or worse, or if their visual field is 20° or less."

        "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that are better suited for bonding in molecules.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Geometry**: The shape of a molecule (e.g., linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, octahedral) is determined by the hybrid orbitals that the central atom uses.\n- **Bonding**: Hybrid orbitals can overlap with orbitals on other atoms to form sigma bonds, and the remaining unhybridized orbitals can form pi bonds.\n\n---\n\n### Common hybridization types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂ |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, C₃H₆ |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n---\n\n### How it works (simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count its valence electrons.\n2. **Determine the number of electron‑pair domains** (bonding pairs + lone pairs) around that atom.\n3. **Assign a hybridization** that matches that number of domains (e.g., 4 domains → sp³).\n4. **Construct the hybrid orbitals**: combine the appropriate s, p, (and sometimes d) orbitals to form the hybrid set.\n5. **Use the hybrids** to form sigma bonds with other atoms; any remaining p orbitals can form pi bonds.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons → 4 bonding pairs with hydrogen.\n- 4 electron‑pair domains → **sp³ hybridization**.\n- Four sp³ orbitals (each 25% s, 75% p) point toward the corners of a tetrahedron.\n- Each sp³ orbital overlaps with an H 1s orbital to form a C–H sigma bond.\n\n---\n\n### Key take‑away\nHybridization is a useful model that helps chemists predict and rationalize the shapes and bonding patterns of molecules. It’s not a literal “mixing” of orbitals in the physical sense, but a convenient way to describe how atoms form bonds in a way that matches observed molecular geometry."

Management is supportive: pain control, physical therapy, respiratory support (ventilation) if needed. |\n| **Prevention** | • **Vaccination** – inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) or oral polio vaccine (OPV).<br>• Good sanitation and hygiene to reduce fecal‑oral spread. |\n| **Historical impact** | Polio epidemics caused widespread paralysis and death, especially in children. Global vaccination campaigns have reduced cases by >99 % and have led to the WHO’s goal of polio eradication. |\n\nIn short, poliomyelitis is a viral infection that can lead to permanent paralysis, but it is largely preventable through vaccination and improved sanitation."

        "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in damp, warm, and poorly ventilated environments. It reproduces by releasing microscopic spores that can spread through the air or on surfaces. When the spores land on a suitable substrate (e.g., wood, drywall, food, or skin), they germinate and form a network of thread‑like cells called mycelium, which can produce visible colonies that appear fuzzy or powdery in various colors (green, black, white, etc.).  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Biology** | Fungi that break down organic matter, often thriving on moisture and decaying material. |\n| **Growth** | Requires moisture, a food source, and a suitable temperature (typically 20–30 °C). |\n| **Health impact** | Can trigger allergies, asthma, and respiratory irritation; some species produce mycotoxins that are toxic if ingested or inhaled. |\n| **Common locations** | Bathrooms, basements, kitchens, attics, and any area with water leaks or high humidity. |\n| **Control** | Reduce moisture, improve ventilation, fix leaks, clean with mold‑removing solutions, and remove heavily infested materials. |\n\nIn short, mold is a fungal organism that thrives in damp conditions, spreads via spores, and can cause both structural damage and health problems."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—specialized proteins (or, in a few cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms.  \n\n| Key features | Details |\n|--------------|---------|\n| **Catalytic role** | They lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed faster and at lower temperatures than it would otherwise. |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one particular substrate (or a small group of related substrates) and converts it into a specific product. This is often described by the “lock‑and‑key” or “induced fit” model. |\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins composed of one or more polypeptide chains folded into a precise three‑dimensional shape. The active site—where the substrate binds—contains amino‑acid residues that interact with the substrate. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by:  <br>• **Allosteric effectors** (activators or inhibitors that bind elsewhere on the enzyme). <br>• **Covalent modifications** (e.g., phosphorylation). <br>• **Gene expression** (how much enzyme is produced). |\n| **Reusability** | After the reaction, the enzyme is unchanged and can catalyze many more cycles. |\n| **Examples** | • **Amylase** – breaks down starch into sugars. <br>• **DNA polymerase** – synthesizes DNA strands. <br>• **Lactase** – digests lactose into glucose and galactose. |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the workhorses of metabolism, enabling the complex chemistry of life to occur efficiently and under mild conditions."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Because the Sun actually emits white light, but the Earth’s atmosphere makes it look yellow.**\n\n| What the Sun emits | What we see |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| **White light** – a mix of all visible wavelengths (≈ 380–750 nm). | **Yellow‑ish** when viewed from the ground. |\n\n### Why the atmosphere changes the color\n\n1. **Rayleigh scattering**  \n   - Short‑wavelength (blue, violet) light is scattered by air molecules more strongly than long‑wavelength (red, orange, yellow) light.  \n   - When the Sun is high in the sky, the line of sight passes through less atmosphere, so less scattering occurs and the Sun looks whiter.  \n   - When the Sun is near the horizon, the light travels through a longer path, scattering away more blue light and leaving a yellow‑to‑red hue.\n\n2. **Human eye sensitivity**  \n   - The eye’s photoreceptors (cones) are most sensitive to green‑yellow wavelengths.  \n   - Even a small amount of blue light is less noticeable, so the mixture of remaining wavelengths is perceived as yellow.\n\n3. **Atmospheric particles and pollution**  \n   - Dust, aerosols, and pollutants can further scatter or absorb blue light, enhancing the yellow/red appearance.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **The Sun is not actually yellow; it shines white.**  \n- **The yellowish color we see is the result of atmospheric scattering and the eye’s response to the remaining wavelengths.**"

        "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many other livestock species.  \n\n| Key facts | Details |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | Foot‑and‑mouth disease virus (FMDV), a member of the *Picornaviridae* family. There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, and Asia 1). |\n| **Transmission** | • Direct contact with infected animals or contaminated bodily fluids (saliva, milk, feces). <br>• Indirect contact via contaminated equipment, clothing, feed, or vehicles. <br>• Airborne spread over short distances (especially in windy conditions). |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (often 1–3 days before lesions). <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that rupture into ulcers on the tongue, lips, inside the mouth, and on the teats (in cattle). <br>• Swelling of the feet and hooves, especially in young animals. <br>• Reduced appetite, weight loss, and decreased milk production. |\n| **Affected species** | Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, antelope, and many other cloven‑hoofed mammals. |\n| **Economic impact** | • Losses from decreased milk and meat production. <br>• Trade restrictions and export bans. <br>• Costs of vaccination, culling, and movement controls. |\n| **Control measures** | • Strict movement controls and quarantine of infected or exposed animals. <br>• Mass vaccination (often with inactivated or live‑attenuated vaccines). <br>• Culling of infected and exposed animals in some countries. <br>• Biosecurity practices (disinfection, controlled access, feed and water hygiene). |\n| **Human health** | FMD is not a zoonotic disease; it does not infect humans. However, it can be transmitted to people via contact with infected animals or contaminated products, causing mild flu‑like symptoms in rare cases. |\n| **Global status** | The disease is endemic in many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, while it is largely eradicated in North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Outbreaks in any country can trigger international trade restrictions. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of cloven‑hoofed animals, leading to significant economic losses in the livestock industry."

        "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain, tenderness, and fatigue throughout the body. It’s often accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\n| Symptom | Typical description |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain that lasts at least three months and is felt on both sides of the body and above and below the waist. |\n| **Tender points** | Specific spots on the body (e.g., neck, shoulders, hips) that are especially painful when pressed. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Trouble falling or staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive issues** | “Fibro fog” – trouble concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Headaches** | Migraines or tension‑type headaches are common. |\n| **Mood changes** | Anxiety, depression, or irritability can accompany the physical symptoms. |\n\n### What’s known about causes?\n- **Central nervous system sensitivity**: The brain and spinal cord may amplify pain signals, making normal sensations feel painful.\n- **Genetics**: A family history can increase risk.\n- **Stress or trauma**: Physical injury, emotional stress, or infections can trigger or worsen symptoms.\n- **Sleep problems**: Poor sleep can worsen pain and fatigue.\n\n### Diagnosis\nThere’s no single lab test. Doctors usually:\n1. Confirm widespread pain lasting ≥3 months.\n2. Check for the 18 classic tender points.\n3. Rule out other conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).\n\n### Treatment\n- **Medications**: Pain relievers, antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine), and anti‑seizure drugs (e.g., gabapentin) can help.\n- **Lifestyle changes**: Regular low‑impact exercise (walking, swimming), stress‑reduction techniques (yoga, meditation), and good sleep hygiene.\n- **Physical therapy**: Strengthening and stretching exercises tailored to the individual.\n- **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Helps manage pain perception and coping strategies.\n\n### Living with Fibromyalgia\n- **Track symptoms**: A pain diary can help identify triggers and effective coping strategies.\n- **Set realistic goals**: Small, achievable steps in activity and self‑care reduce frustration.\n- **Seek support**: Support groups, counseling, or online communities can provide emotional help.\n\nFibromyalgia is a real, often debilitating condition, but with a combination of medical care, lifestyle adjustments, and support, many people find ways to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated.  \nIn other words, the interest “compounds” or “re‑invests” itself, so each period you earn interest on a larger base.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The basic formula\n\nFor an investment that compounds **n** times per year, with an annual nominal rate **r** (expressed as a decimal), and a principal **P**, the amount **A** after **t** years is\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- **P** – initial principal  \n- **r** – annual interest rate (e.g., 5 % → 0.05)  \n- **n** – number of compounding periods per year  \n- **t** – number of years\n\nThe **interest earned** is \\(A - P\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Common compounding frequencies\n\n| Compounding frequency | n | Example: 5 % annual rate |\n|-----------------------|---|--------------------------|\n| Annually (once a year) | 1 | \\(A = P(1+0.05)^t\\) |\n| Semi‑annually (twice a year) | 2 | \\(A = P(1+0.025)^{2t}\\) |\n| Quarterly | 4 | \\(A = P(1+0.0125)^{4t}\\) |\n| Monthly | 12 | \\(A = P(1+0.0041667)^{12t}\\) |\n| Daily (≈ 365 times) | 365 | \\(A = P(1+0.00013699)^{365t}\\) |\n\nThe more frequently interest is compounded, the larger the final amount.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Continuous compounding\n\nWhen compounding happens an infinite number of times per year, the formula becomes\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\).  \nThis is often used in finance theory and for very high‑frequency compounding.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Example\n\nSuppose you invest \\$1,000 at an annual rate of 6 % compounded monthly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)  \n- \\(r = 0.06\\)  \n- \\(n = 12\\)  \n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{36}\n  \\approx 1{,}000 \\times 1.197 \\approx 1{,}197\n\\]\n\nYou would have about **\\$1,197** after 3 years, earning roughly **\\$197** in interest.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Why it matters\n\n- **Growth advantage**: Even a modest rate can produce a large difference over time because the interest itself earns interest.\n- **Savings & loans**: Banks use compound interest to calculate interest on deposits and loans.\n- **Investment planning**: Understanding compounding helps you set realistic goals and compare financial products.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Compound interest is the “interest on interest” that lets your money grow faster than simple interest, where interest is calculated only on the original principal."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** is the process of combining two different entities—whether organisms, molecules, or languages—to create a new, mixed product that contains characteristics of both parents.  The term is used in several scientific and cultural fields; the core idea is the same: *mixing to produce something that is partly one thing and partly another.*\n\n| Field | What is hybridized | Typical purpose / outcome |\n|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Biology / Genetics** | Two different species, varieties, or breeds | Produce offspring that combine desirable traits (e.g., disease resistance, higher yield, ornamental beauty).  Example: a hybrid corn plant that is both drought‑tolerant and high‑yielding. |\n| **Chemistry** | Atomic orbitals or molecules | Create new chemical bonds or compounds with unique properties.  Example: the hybridization of carbon’s 2s and 2p orbitals (sp³, sp², sp) determines the geometry of organic molecules. |\n| **Linguistics** | Two languages or dialects | Generate a new language variety or pidgin.  Example: Creole languages that arise when speakers of different tongues need to communicate. |\n| **Botany** | Two plant varieties or species | Produce a hybrid plant that may have improved growth, flavor, or resistance.  Example: the “F1” hybrid tomato that is more productive than either parent. |\n| **Genetics (Molecular)** | DNA strands from different parents | Create recombinant DNA for research or biotechnology.  Example: plasmid vectors that combine genes from two organisms. |\n| **Cultural / Social** | Two cultural traditions | Form a new hybrid culture or art form.  Example: fusion cuisine that blends Mexican and Japanese flavors. |\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Cross‑breeding vs. Hybridization**  \n   - *Cross‑breeding* is a broader term that can involve any mating between individuals.  \n   - *Hybridization* specifically refers to the creation of a hybrid that is distinct from either parent, often with new or enhanced traits.\n\n2. **Hybrid Vigor (Heterosis)**  \n   - Many hybrids exhibit *heterosis*, where they outperform both parents in growth, yield, or resilience.\n\n3. **Hybridization in Chemistry**  \n   - Orbital hybridization (sp, sp², sp³) explains molecular shapes and bonding patterns.  \n   - Chemical hybridization can also refer to mixing different chemical species to form alloys or composites.\n\n4. **Hybridization in Linguistics**  \n   - Pidgins arise when speakers of different languages need a simplified communication system.  \n   - Creoles develop when a pidgin becomes fully developed and nativized.\n\n5. **Hybridization in Technology**  \n   - Hybrid vehicles combine internal combustion engines with electric motors.  \n   - Hybrid cloud computing blends on‑premises and public cloud resources.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nHybridization is the intentional or natural blending of two distinct sources to produce a new entity that carries traits from both. Whether you’re talking about plants, genes, molecules, or languages, the concept revolves around *mixing to create something novel and often superior.*"

        "**Pediatricians** are medical doctors who specialize in the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents (generally up to age 18, though some practice with young adults up to 21–25).  \n\n### Key points\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Training** | • 4‑year undergraduate degree (often in a science field). <br>• 4‑year medical school (MD or DO). <br>• 3‑year residency in pediatrics (sometimes 4 years for combined programs). <br>• Optional fellowships for sub‑specialties (e.g., neonatology, pediatric cardiology). |\n| **Scope of practice** | • Physical exams, growth & development monitoring. <br>• Diagnosis & treatment of acute illnesses (e.g., infections, asthma). <br>• Management of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, epilepsy). <br>• Preventive care: vaccinations, nutrition counseling, safety advice. <br>• Counseling on behavioral, developmental, and mental‑health issues. |\n| **Specialties within pediatrics** | • **Neonatology** – care of newborns, especially premature or ill infants. <br>• **Pediatric cardiology** – heart conditions in children. <br>• **Pediatric oncology** – cancer treatment. <br>• **Pediatric neurology** – neurological disorders. <br>• **Pediatric endocrinology** – hormones, growth, diabetes. <br>• **Pediatric infectious disease** – infections specific to children. <br>• **Pediatric genetics** – inherited disorders. <br>• **Pediatric emergency medicine** – urgent care in hospitals or urgent‑care centers. |\n| **Why they’re important** | Children have unique physiological and developmental needs that differ from adults. Pediatricians tailor medical care to those differences, ensuring early detection of problems, proper growth, and healthy transitions into adulthood. |\n\nIn short, a pediatrician is a doctor who focuses on the medical care of children, from newborns through adolescence, covering everything from routine check‑ups to complex disease management."

        "**Poliomyelitis** (often called **polio**) is a viral disease that can cause paralysis and, in severe cases, death. It is caused by the **polio virus (poliovirus)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family.  \n\n| Key facts |\n|-----------|\n| **Transmission** | Primarily fecal‑oral (contaminated food or water). It can also spread via respiratory droplets in some outbreaks. |\n| **Incubation period** | 7–14 days (range 3–35 days). |\n| **Clinical course** | 1. **Incubation** – no symptoms.<br>2. **Prodromal phase** – low‑grade fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache, and sometimes a mild rash.<br>3. **Paralytic phase** – in ~5–10 % of infections, the virus invades the nervous system, causing flaccid paralysis that can affect the limbs, diaphragm, or both. |\n| **Symptoms** | • Fever, sore throat, headache, fatigue<br>• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain<br>• Muscle pain, stiffness, or weakness<br>• In severe cases: flaccid paralysis, respiratory failure (if the diaphragm is involved) |\n| **Diagnosis** | • Clinical assessment (history of exposure, symptoms)<br>• Laboratory tests: stool sample, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood for poliovirus isolation or PCR. |\n| **Treatment** | • No antiviral therapy; care is supportive: pain control, hydration, respiratory support if needed.<br>• Physical therapy for recovery of muscle strength. |\n| **Prevention** | • **Vaccination** – the most effective measure. Two main vaccines: <br>  – Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) – injected, used in many countries.<br>  – Oral polio vaccine (OPV) – contains live attenuated virus, used in mass‑campaigns in some regions.<br>• Good hygiene: handwashing, safe drinking water, sanitation. |\n| **Global status** | Polio has been eliminated in most of the world. WHO reports only a handful of cases per year, mainly in a few countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Pakistan). The goal is complete eradication. |\n| **Historical impact** | In the 20th century, polio epidemics caused widespread paralysis and death. The development of the vaccine in the 1950s (Salk) and later the oral vaccine (Sabin) dramatically reduced incidence. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Poliomyelitis is a viral infection that can lead to paralysis; it is preventable with vaccination and has been largely eliminated worldwide through coordinated immunization campaigns."

Heat is generated by the residual heat from the planet’s formation, ongoing radioactive decay, and the slow crystallization of the inner core.  \n- **How do we know?** Direct measurement is impossible, so scientists use seismic wave data, laboratory experiments on iron under high pressure, and computer models of Earth’s interior to infer the temperature.  \n- **Typical range:** Most geophysicists quote 5 500 °C–6 000 °C, with some models extending up to 7 000 °C.  \n\nSo, the core is roughly as hot as the surface of the Sun (which is about 5 500 °C), making it one of the hottest places in the Solar System."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar cells** (also called photovoltaic cells) are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. They do this by using the photovoltaic effect, where photons from the sun knock electrons loose from atoms in a semiconductor material, creating an electric current.  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Basic structure** | A thin layer of semiconductor (usually silicon) sandwiched between two conductive layers. |\n| **How it works** | Light hits the semiconductor → electrons are excited → an electric field at the junction pushes electrons toward one side, creating a flow of current. |\n| **Types** | • **Monocrystalline** – single‑crystal silicon, high efficiency, higher cost. <br>• **Polycrystalline** – multiple silicon crystals, slightly lower efficiency, cheaper. <br>• **Thin‑film** – amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, CIGS; flexible, lower cost, lower efficiency. |\n| **Applications** | • Grid‑connected solar panels for homes and businesses. <br>• Off‑grid or portable power (solar chargers, RVs, satellites). <br>• Integrated into building materials (building‑integrated photovoltaics). |\n| **Efficiency** | Typical commercial panels range from 15 % to 22 % conversion efficiency; research cells can exceed 40 % in laboratory settings. |\n| **Benefits** | Renewable, low operating cost, reduces greenhouse‑gas emissions, can be installed in many environments. |\n| **Limitations** | Requires sunlight (daylight, weather dependent), initial cost, space requirement, and energy storage needed for nighttime or cloudy periods. |\n\nIn short, a solar cell is a semiconductor device that turns photons from the sun into usable electrical energy."

        "**Semiconductors** are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass). Their conductivity can be precisely controlled by adding impurities (doping) or by applying electric fields, light, or temperature changes.  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Common materials** | Silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) are the most widely used. Others include gallium arsenide (GaAs), silicon carbide (SiC), and various compound semiconductors. |\n| **Band structure** | In a semiconductor, the valence band (filled with electrons) is separated from the conduction band (empty) by a small energy gap (bandgap). Electrons can jump across this gap when energy is supplied, creating charge carriers. |\n| **Doping** | Adding a small amount of another element (e.g., phosphorus or boron) introduces extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type), enabling the creation of p‑n junctions, diodes, transistors, etc. |\n| **Applications** | • Integrated circuits (microprocessors, memory chips) <br>• Solar cells (photovoltaic) <br>• LEDs, laser diodes <br>• Sensors, RF/microwave devices <br>• Power electronics (IGBTs, MOSFETs) |\n| **Why “semi‑”** | They are not as conductive as metals, but they can be made to conduct (or not) under controlled conditions, giving designers the ability to build complex electronic functions. |\n\nIn short, semiconductors are engineered materials whose electrical properties can be tuned, making them the backbone of modern electronics, from computers and smartphones to solar panels and LED lighting."

      "question": "What is natural gas composed of ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "Natural gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons and other gases that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition varies with the source, but a typical natural‑gas stream contains:\n\n| Component | Typical range (by volume) | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; the main fuel. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 10 % | Used as a feedstock for petrochemicals. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Often separated for use as LPG. |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 2 % | Also separated for LPG. |\n| **Other higher hydrocarbons** | < 1 % | Includes pentanes, hexanes, etc. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; dilutes the gas. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; removed for pipeline quality. |\n| **Trace gases** | < 0.1 % | Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), water vapor, argon, etc. |\n\n**Key points**\n\n* The exact mix depends on the geological formation and the processing steps (e.g., dehydration, sweetening to remove H₂S, and fractionation to separate LPG).  \n* The “sweet” natural gas (low H₂S) is preferred for pipelines and power‑plant use.  \n* The “wet” natural gas contains more higher‑order hydrocarbons and is often processed to produce LPG and other petrochemical feedstocks."
