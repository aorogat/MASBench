      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun itself isn’t actually yellow—it emits a nearly “white” spectrum of light (its surface temperature is about 5,800 K).  What makes the Sun look yellow to us on Earth is the way that light travels through our atmosphere.\n\n**Rayleigh scattering**: Short‑wavelength (blue) light is scattered much more strongly by the molecules and small particles in the air than longer‑wavelength (red, orange, yellow) light. When we look straight up at the Sun, the blue component of its light is scattered in all directions, so the direct beam that reaches our eyes is relatively depleted in blue and richer in yellow‑orange wavelengths. That gives the Sun a yellowish hue.\n\nAt sunrise or sunset the Sun’s light must pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, scattering even more of the blue light and leaving the red‑orange part of the spectrum, so the Sun looks reddish or orange. When the Sun is high in the sky and the atmosphere is relatively clear, the scattering is less pronounced and the Sun can appear almost white or pale yellow.\n\nSo the Sun is intrinsically white; it looks yellow because of the scattering of its light by Earth’s atmosphere.",

      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hooved animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and deer. The virus causes fever and painful blisters (vesicles) in the mouth and on the feet, which can lead to lameness, weight loss, and reduced milk production. Because it spreads rapidly through direct contact, aerosols, and contaminated equipment, FMD is a major concern for livestock producers and can have severe economic impacts. The disease is not transmissible to humans, but it can be carried by people, vehicles, and imported animal products, so strict control measures—including quarantine, culling, and vaccination—are often implemented to prevent outbreaks.",

      "question": "What is the sales tax rate in New York ?",
      "system_answer": "**1. What is an ulcer?**  \nAn ulcer is a sore that develops in the lining of an organ—most commonly the stomach (gastric ulcer), the first part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcer), or the esophagus. It results from a breakdown of the protective mucous layer, often caused by *Helicobacter pylori* infection, prolonged use of non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress, or other factors. Ulcers can cause pain, bleeding, and, if untreated, complications such as perforation or bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**2. What is compounded interest?**  \nCompounded interest is the interest that is calculated on the initial principal amount **and** on the interest that has previously accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” because each period’s interest is added to the principal, and the next period’s interest is calculated on this larger amount. The formula for compound interest (for discrete compounding) is:  \n\n\\[\nA = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n- \\(A\\) = final amount,  \n- \\(P\\) = principal,  \n- \\(r\\) = annual interest rate (decimal),  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year,  \n- \\(t\\) = time in years.\n\n---\n\n**3. What does CPR stand for?**  \nCPR stands for **Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation**—a life‑saving emergency procedure that combines chest compressions and rescue breaths to maintain circulation and oxygenation until normal heart function can be restored or advanced medical help arrives.\n\n---\n\n**4. What is hybridization?**  \nHybridization can refer to several concepts depending on the field:\n\n| Field | Definition |\n|-------|------------|\n| **Chemistry** | The mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals (e.g., sp, sp², sp³) that explain molecular shapes and bonding. |\n| **Biology** | The interbreeding of two different species, varieties, or populations to produce a hybrid offspring (e.g., a mule from a horse and donkey). |\n| **Linguistics** | The blending of features from two or more languages or dialects to create a new, mixed language or speech pattern. |\n| **Genetics** | The process by which a gene from one parent is combined with a gene from another parent, often leading to new traits. |\n\n---\n\n**5. How fast is alcohol absorbed?**  \nAlcohol absorption is rapid but varies with several factors (food intake, alcohol concentration, individual metabolism). Typical timelines:\n\n| Situation | Approx. Time to Peak Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Clear stomach (fasting)** | 30–60 minutes |\n| **With food** | 60–90 minutes |\n| **High‑concentration drinks (e.g., spirits)** | 20–30 minutes for 80 % of the alcohol |\n| **Low‑concentration drinks (e.g., beer, wine)** | 60–90 minutes |\n\nAfter reaching peak BAC, alcohol is metabolized at roughly 0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour in most adults.\n\n---\n\n**6. Who was the first American to walk in space?**  \nThe first American to perform a spacewalk (extravehicular activity) was **Ed White** aboard Gemini 4 on **June 3, 1965**. He floated outside the spacecraft for about 23 minutes.\n\n---\n\n**7. What are pediatricians?**  \nPediatricians are medical doctors who specialize in the health care of infants, children, and adolescents (typically from birth to 18 years, sometimes up to 21 years). They diagnose and treat illnesses, provide preventive care, administer vaccines, and monitor growth and development.\n\n---\n\n**8. What is the sales tax rate in New York?**  \n- **State sales tax:** 4 % (applies to most goods and some services).  \n- **Local taxes:** Add municipal, county, and special district taxes.  \n  - **New York City:** 4.5 % local + 4 % state = **8.875 %** total.  \n  - **Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, etc.:** 4 % state + 0.5–1.5 % local = **4.5–5.5 %**.  \n- **Overall average:** Roughly **8–9 %** depending on the locality.  \n\nAlways check the specific city or county for the exact combined rate.",
