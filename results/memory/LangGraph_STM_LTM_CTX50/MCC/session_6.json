      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects cloven‑hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and deer. It is caused by a picornavirus belonging to the *Pestivirus* genus.  \n\n**Key features**\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Clinical signs** | Fever, lameness, and painful vesicles (blisters) on the feet, mouth, and teats. The vesicles rupture, leaving ulcerated lesions that can lead to secondary bacterial infections. |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed or water, and through the air over short distances. The virus can survive in the environment (e.g., on fomites, in dust) for weeks. |\n| **Affected species** | Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, and other cloven‑hoofed livestock. It can also infect some wildlife species. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from decreased milk and meat production, trade restrictions, culling of infected or exposed animals, and costs of vaccination and biosecurity measures. |\n| **Control measures** | Vaccination (often with inactivated virus), movement restrictions, culling of infected and exposed animals, strict biosecurity protocols, and surveillance. |\n| **Human health** | The virus does not infect humans, but people can become infected with the virus’s genetic material through handling infected animals or contaminated materials. However, it is not a zoonotic disease. |\n\n**Why it matters**  \nBecause of its rapid spread and severe economic consequences, many countries have strict surveillance and control programs. Outbreaks can lead to international trade bans and significant financial losses for the livestock industry.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the process of earning interest on both the original amount of money (the principal) and on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or is added to the principal, so that in the next period you earn interest on a larger amount.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Initial deposit (principal)** – the amount you start with.  \n2. **Interest rate** – the percentage you earn per compounding period.  \n3. **Compounding frequency** – how often the interest is added to the principal (e.g., annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, or continuously).\n\nThe formula for compound interest (for discrete compounding) is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = the amount after \\(t\\) years  \n- \\(P\\) = principal (initial deposit)  \n- \\(r\\) = annual interest rate (decimal)  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year  \n- \\(t\\) = number of years\n\n### Example\nSuppose you invest \\$1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded monthly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)  \n- \\(r = 0.05\\)  \n- \\(n = 12\\)  \n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  \\approx 1{,}161.62\n\\]\n\nSo after 3 years you would have about \\$1,161.62, with \\$161.62 earned as interest.\n\n### Key points\n- **Interest on interest**: Each compounding period adds interest to the principal, so subsequent interest calculations include that added amount.  \n- **Frequency matters**: More frequent compounding (e.g., daily vs. yearly) yields a slightly higher final amount because interest is added more often.  \n- **Continuous compounding**: If interest is compounded an infinite number of times per year, the formula becomes \\(A = P e^{rt}\\).\n\nCompound interest is a fundamental concept in finance, used in savings accounts, mortgages, bonds, and many investment products. It demonstrates how money can grow faster over time when interest is reinvested.",

      "system_answer": "Alcohol is absorbed very quickly once it reaches the stomach and small intestine.  \n* **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** is usually reached within **30–90 minutes** after drinking.  \n* The rate depends on a few factors:  \n  * **Concentration** – higher‑strength drinks (e.g., spirits) are absorbed faster than diluted beverages.  \n  * **Food in the stomach** – a full stomach slows absorption, while an empty stomach speeds it up.  \n  * **Rate of consumption** – sipping slowly allows the stomach to empty into the small intestine, whereas gulping or “binge” drinking can saturate the stomach and accelerate absorption.  \n  * **Individual differences** – age, sex, body weight, and liver function also influence how quickly alcohol enters the bloodstream.  \n\nIn short, alcohol typically reaches its peak in the blood within about half an hour to an hour after consumption, with the exact timing varying by the factors above.",

      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—mostly electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun’s atmosphere (the corona). These particles are accelerated to high speeds (typically 300–800 km/s) and flow outward through the entire solar system, carrying with them the Sun’s magnetic field. Solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres, creates auroras, and can influence space‑based technology and the Earth’s upper atmosphere.",

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar cells** (also called photovoltaic cells) are semiconductor devices that convert light—specifically sunlight—directly into electricity. They work by exploiting the **photovoltaic effect**: when photons strike the cell, they excite electrons in the semiconductor material, creating electron‑hole pairs that are separated by an internal electric field. This separation generates a flow of electric current that can be harnessed for power.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Typical Details |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Material** | Most common: crystalline silicon (monocrystalline or polycrystalline). Others include thin‑film materials such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and emerging perovskites. |\n| **Structure** | A p‑type layer and an n‑type layer form a p‑n junction. The junction creates an electric field that drives electrons toward the n‑side and holes toward the p‑side, producing a voltage. |\n| **Operation** | • Light photons hit the cell. <br>• Electrons are knocked loose, creating electron‑hole pairs. <br>• The internal field separates them, generating a current. <br>• The current flows through an external circuit, delivering usable power. |\n| **Efficiency** | Commercial silicon cells typically reach 15–22 % efficiency; high‑performance research cells can exceed 30 %. |\n| **Applications** | • Residential and commercial rooftop installations. <br>• Utility‑scale solar farms. <br>• Portable devices (solar chargers, calculators). <br>• Spacecraft power (solar panels on satellites, the International Space Station). |\n| **Advantages** | • Renewable, abundant energy source. <br>• Low operating costs and minimal maintenance. <br>• Scalable from small panels to large arrays. |\n| **Challenges** | • Production cost and material scarcity (e.g., silicon, rare metals). <br>• Efficiency limits and energy payback time. <br>• Environmental concerns over manufacturing and disposal. |\n\nIn short, a solar cell is a tiny, solid‑state device that turns photons from the sun into a steady electric current, forming the fundamental building block of photovoltaic power systems.",
