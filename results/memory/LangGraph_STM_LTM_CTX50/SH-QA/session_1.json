      "system_answer": "The term “Norse” (or “Viking”) covers a wide range of peoples and time‑periods, so there isn’t a single “Norse leader” in the way you might think of a king of a single nation.

Below are some of the most famous Norse leaders, grouped by the period in which they were active:\n\n| Period | Leader | Key Achievements |\n|--------|--------|------------------|\n| **Early Viking Age (c. 800–900)** | **Ragnar Lodbrok** | Legendary king‑pirate who raided England, France, and the Mediterranean; his exploits are the basis for many sagas. |\n| | **Ivar the Boneless** | One of Ragnar’s sons, famed for his skill in siege warfare and for leading the Great Heathen Army into England. |\n| | **Harold Bluetooth** | Danish king who unified Denmark and introduced Christianity to the Danes. |\n| | **Olaf Tryggvason** | Norwegian king who led a major Christianisation campaign and fought the Battle of Svolder (1000 CE). |\n| **High Viking Age (c. 900–1000)** | **Harald Hardrada** | King of Norway who famously attempted to claim the English throne at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (1066). |\n| | **Leif Erikson** | Norse explorer who reached Vinland (present‑day Newfoundland) around 1000 CE. |\n| | **Erik the Red** | Founder of the first Norse settlement in Greenland (c. 982). |\n| **Late Viking Age / Early Middle Ages (c. 1000–1100)** | **Olaf II (St. Olaf)** | King of Norway who consolidated the Christian church and was later canonised. |\n| | **King Sweyn Forkbeard** | Danish king who briefly ruled England (1013–1014) before his son Cnut. |\n| | **Cnut the Great** | Danish‑born king who ruled England, Denmark, and Norway (1016–1035). |\n| **Post‑Viking Age (c. 1100–1200)** | **King Magnus V of Norway** | Known as “Magnus the Good”; he re‑established Norwegian independence after the Danish‑Norwegian union. |\n\nIf you had a particular region, time‑period, or type of activity (e.g., raiding, exploration, settlement) in mind, let me know and I can narrow the list further.",
