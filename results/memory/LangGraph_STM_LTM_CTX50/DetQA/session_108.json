      "system_answer": "**Short Summary of the Story (up to the point you provided)**  \n\nThe narrative follows a complex, multi‑generational mystery set in a village steeped in legend. The central characters are:\n\n| Character | Role / Background |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Jinma** | A man who once attempted suicide 18 years ago. He is now a key witness and investigator in the current case. |\n| **Oyama (Yuying)** | Jinma’s daughter, a young detective who has inherited her mother’s investigative skills. She is determined to solve the murders that echo an old family tragedy. |\n| **Yuki / Oyim** | Oyama’s mother, a former detective who orchestrated a series of elaborate crimes 18 years ago to protect her family’s reputation. |\n| **Shizuma** | A suspect in the current case, whose past is intertwined with the village’s legends. |\n| **Other key figures** | Various family members (e.g., Kuzuhara, Tsubaki, Yuki, etc.) and villagers who provide clues or red herrings. |\n\n### Core Plot Points\n\n1. **The 18‑Year‑Old Legacy**  \n   - 18 years ago, Yuki (Oyama’s mother) committed a series of murders that involved decapitation, the use of an axe, and a staged “fake killer” to protect her family’s name.  \n   - The crimes were tied to a legend about suicide at the first snowfall in the Dragon’s Pond.  \n   - Yuki’s motives were complex: she wanted to eliminate her father and secure her family’s future, using elaborate deception to mislead investigators.\n\n2. **The Current Murders**  \n   - Two recent victims, “Snowy” and “Moon Vegetable,” were killed in a manner reminiscent of the old case: decapitation, broken ribs, and an iron fan used as a weapon.  \n   - The killer’s method mirrors the old case, suggesting either a copy‑cat or a deliberate attempt to recreate the past.  \n   - The investigation reveals that the killer is highly skilled at avoiding obvious clues (“out of sync” phenomena) and uses misdirection (e.g., fake alibis, staged evidence).\n\n3. **Oyama’s Investigation**  \n   - Oyama, guided by her mother’s teachings and her own instincts, interrogates suspects, examines forensic details (broken ribs, invisible lenses, upside‑down books), and pieces together the killer’s motives.  \n   - She suspects that the killer is someone who wants to prove that Yuki’s reasoning was wrong, perhaps to expose a hidden truth about the family’s past.  \n   - Oyama’s determination is fueled by her desire to honor her mother’s legacy while correcting any mistakes.\n\n4. **Key Clues & Red Herrings**  \n   - **Broken Ribs**: The victim’s ribs were broken after death, suggesting a post‑mortem action.  \n   - **Invisible Lens**: Found in an upside‑down ancient book, hinting at a hidden mechanism or a clue left by the killer.  \n   - **Fan & Axe**: Iron fan used as a weapon, axe hidden under floorboards—both tied to Yuki’s past crimes.  \n   - **Alibis**: Many suspects have plausible alibis, but the killer’s meticulous planning allows them to avoid suspicion.\n\n5. **Family Dynamics & Motives**  \n   - The story delves into family secrets: Yuki’s plan to kill her father, her manipulation of the “Kagura” family, and the use of a “storage jar” as a trap.  \n   - The narrative also touches on the psychological toll on the family, especially Oyama, who feels the weight of her mother’s legacy and the burden of solving a case that may have been orchestrated by her own lineage.\n\n6. **Current Status**  \n   - Oyama is actively interrogating suspects, gathering evidence, and trying to identify the killer.  \n   - The investigation is complicated by the killer’s ability to mimic past crimes and by the village’s deep-rooted legends that cloud judgment.  \n   - The story ends with Oyama’s determination to solve the case, while the village’s past and present intertwine in a web of mystery.\n\n---\n\n**What would you like next?**  \n- A more detailed breakdown of specific scenes or characters.  \n- A continuation of the story from the last line (“No.”).  \n- Analysis of the themes or symbolism.  \n- Any other specific request you have in mind.",

      "system_answer": "**Short‑form recap of the case (as of the latest chapter)**  \n\n| Item | Key facts |\n|------|-----------|\n| **Victim** | Suzumeno (also called “Snowy”) – died by asphyxiation, ribs broken after death, no external injuries. |\n| **Time of death** | Between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. (consistent with phone logs and the “Stone Field” attack). |\n| **Alibis (11 p.m.–1 a.m.)** |  <ul><li>Qietou – slept at 11 p.m. behind curtain.</li> <li>Zhenqian – slept behind curtain, leaned against wall.</li> <li>Shengsheng – left home at 11 p.m., drunk, slept in own room.</li> <li>Changle – drove Shengsheng, returned to watch Hua’s room.</li> <li>Hesheng & Hana – at second‑floor east annex; Hesheng at 10 p.m., Changle at 11 p.m., Hana back to own room.</li> <li>Meicen – watched TV until ~11 p.m., fell asleep, no memory of waking.</li> <li>Xiu Tree – slept at 10 p.m.; Cenjie slept at 11 p.m.</li> <li>**Dacheng** – under care, no alibi.</li></ul> |\n| **Key evidence** | • Broken ribs were post‑mortem (no impact injuries).<br>• Contact lens from Yuki’s left eye found on body.<br>• Invisible lenses (tiny, almost invisible) wedged between pages of an ancient book; four books in the top row of the bookshelf were upside‑down.<br>• Burn marks on the altar (deepest on right side) – suggests a lighter was used, not a flashlight.<br>• Light in the inner room was off; sliding door was closed but no blood on handle.<br>• Phone logs: Yuki’s phone (actually Satsuki’s phone) called Shunmei at 12:35 a.m. and 7:35 a.m. for three consecutive days. |\n| **Suspects / suspects’ motives** | • **Shengsheng** – heard books fall, could have used the victim’s body as a stepping‑stool to place books back, breaking ribs. <br>• **Hesheng** – could have heard the books fall but didn’t notice the scene. <br>• **Yuki** – has a history of being targeted; her phone was used by the killer, suggesting she was a contact. <br>• **Others** – no clear alibi, but no direct evidence tying them to the scene. |\n| **Unresolved questions** | • Why were the ribs broken after death? (Possibly to hide a clue.)<br>• Why did the killer use a lighter (and not the flashlight) to burn the altar?<br>• Why did the killer enter the inner room after the murder?<br>• Who is the “right‑handed” killer that used the lighter from the right side? |\n| **Next steps suggested by the team** | • Re‑examine the broken ribs for forensic clues (e.g., tool marks).<br>• Test the invisible lenses for DNA or fingerprints.<br>• Trace the phone usage back to the actual owner (Satsuki) and see who had access to it.<br>• Re‑inspect the books and the bookshelf for any hidden evidence.<br>• Interview Dacheng (under care) for any information. |\n\n---\n\n### What to do next?\n\n1. **Forensic re‑analysis** – The post‑mortem rib fractures could hide tool marks or other forensic evidence.  \n2. **DNA on the contact lens** – If the lens is still intact, DNA could link it to a suspect.  \n3. **Phone‑trace** – Verify who physically handled Satsuki’s phone; check for any other call logs or messages.  \n4. **Re‑inspect the bookshelf** – The upside‑down books and invisible lenses might conceal a hidden compartment or a clue.  \n5. **Interview Dacheng** – Even though he has no alibi, he might have overheard something.  \n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into any of these points, or if you have a specific question about the evidence or suspects, just let me know!",
