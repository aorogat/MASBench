      "system_answer": "It looks like you’ve pasted a long excerpt from a detective‑style narrative (the style and characters—Poirot, a hotel, a murder mystery—suggest it’s a mystery novel or a fan‑fiction adaptation).  \nHere’s a quick rundown of the key points that emerge from the passage:\n\n| Element | Summary |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Setting** | A hotel (often referred to as “Blaux‑Han” or “Brawnsham”) in London, with a restaurant and several guest rooms (rooms 121, 238, 317). |\n| **Victims** | Three people: Harriet Sipper (room 121), Ada Gransbury (room 317), and Richard Nigges (room 238). All were found dead, apparently poisoned. |\n| **Timeline** | The murders occurred before 7:15 PM. Afternoon tea was delivered at 7:15 PM to room 317, but the bodies were already dead. |\n| **Key suspects/characters** | • **Poirot** – the detective leading the investigation. <br>• **Raphael Bork/​Burbak** – waiter who delivered the tea. <br>• **Thomas Breen/​Brine** – hotel staff who interacted with the victims. <br>• **Luca Lazari** – hotel manager. <br>• **Samuel Kid** – a boiler‑maker who witnessed a mysterious woman with golden keys. <br>• **Henry Nigges** – brother of Richard Nigges, provides background on the victim’s past. |\n| **Key clues** | • Poison was in the sherry and tea cups, but the actual murder happened earlier (likely via cyanide in the water). <br>• A “gold cufflink” with a letter combination was found in each victim’s mouth. <br>• A homeless man with a suitcase and a woman with golden keys were seen near the hotel. <br>• The victims had a shared connection to a village called Glebeholme (or similar). |\n| **Plot twists** | • The victims were not strangers; they were friends who had been invited to a tea party. <br>• The killer staged the scene by placing poisoned drinks after the murders to mislead investigators. <br>• The murderer may have used a disguise or impersonation (someone posing as Richard Nigges). <br>• The “golden keys” hint at a deeper motive tied to the victims’ past. |\n| **Current status** | Poirot is piecing together the timeline, interrogating staff, and trying to link the golden keys, the cufflinks, and the victims’ shared history to identify the murderer. |\n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into any particular part—character motivations, the significance of the keys, or how Poirot’s deductions unfold—just let me know!",
