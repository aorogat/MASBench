Shigemori‑san is the only suspect who is known to have that access. |\n| **The letter was addressed to the editor‑in‑chief of a Tokyo publishing house** – a “high‑profile” target that would require a discreet delivery. | Shigemori‑san is the only person who could have arranged a covert delivery without arousing suspicion. |\n| **The phone call with the “frog‑like” voice** – a mysterious caller who asked for an envelope and postage. | The caller’s identity is unknown, but the fact that the letter was never sent suggests the caller was the killer, who used the letter as a covert message. Shigemori‑san is the only suspect who could have received that letter and then delivered it. |\n| **No other suspect had a plausible way to open the mailbox** – the post office was closed due to landslides, and the only person who could have bypassed that was Shigemori‑san. | This eliminates all other suspects. |\n\n---\n\n## What we still don’t know\n\n* **Kenzo Onizuka’s killer** – The text ends with the investigators still debating how the note was delivered and who might have been involved. No concrete evidence has yet linked a suspect to Onizuka’s murder.  \n* **The “frog‑like” caller** – The identity of the caller remains unknown. It could be the killer, a co‑conspirator, or a red herring.  \n* **The second letter** – The story hints that a second letter may have existed but was never sent. Whether it was written, delivered, or destroyed is still unclear.\n\n---\n\n## Quick recap of the key plot points\n\n1. **Sugawara’s letter** – Written between 11:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. the day before the incident, addressed to the editor‑in‑chief.  \n2. **Phone call** – A mysterious, low‑voiced caller asked for an envelope and postage. The caller’s voice was described as “frog‑like.”  \n3. **The envelope** – Given to Sugawara the night before the incident; the letter was found in the post office’s mailbox but never opened.  \n4. **Suspects** – Several villagers were questioned, but only Shigemori‑san had the means to open the mailbox and deliver the letter.  \n5. **Unresolved questions** – Who made the phone call? Why was a second letter never sent? Who killed Kenzo Onizuka?\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Kawai Toshiyuki**: The evidence points to **Shigemori‑san** as the most likely killer.  \n- **Kenzo Onizuka**: The killer remains unidentified; the investigation is still in progress.\n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into any particular suspect, clue, or timeline, just let me know!",
