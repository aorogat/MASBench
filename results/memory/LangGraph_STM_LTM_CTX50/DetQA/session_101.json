      "system_answer": "**Short Summary**\n\nThe passage is a long, somewhat fragmented narrative that follows a detective—Hercule Poirot—conversing with an unnamed narrator about a murder case at 19 Wilbraham Crescent. Poirot reviews various books and literary styles to frame his thinking, then turns to the case itself. He describes the victim’s identity as unknown, the suspects (neighbors, a blind woman, a couple, a typewriter agency, etc.), and the clues that have emerged (phone calls, a missing insurance card, a strange clock, etc.). Poirot’s method is to listen to casual conversations among neighbors, hoping they’ll reveal hidden motives. He speculates about motives (inheritance, jealousy, revenge) and suspects (a woman named Miss Martin, Mrs. Brand, etc.), but the narrative ends abruptly with a mention of “those clocks” and a suggestion that Miss Rosemary might be involved.\n\n**What would you like next?**\n\n- A more detailed breakdown of the suspects and evidence  \n- A continuation of the story (writing the next chapter)  \n- An analysis of Poirot’s investigative techniques  \n- Anything else you have in mind  \n\nJust let me know how I can help!",

      "system_answer": "It looks like you’ve pasted a long excerpt from a detective story (with a Poirot‑style narrator) that involves a murder at 19 Wilbraham Crescent, a mysterious victim, and a tangled web of suspects and alibis. The narrative jumps between scenes, characters, and even some meta‑references (e.g., to “The Walrus and the Carpenter” and various literary allusions).\n\n**Key points from the passage:**\n\n| Element | Summary |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Setting** | 19 Wilbraham Crescent, a house in a quiet street; the surrounding area includes other houses (18, 20, etc.) and a typewriting agency. |\n| **Victim** | An unnamed middle‑aged man who was found dead; his identity is unclear (no wallet, no ID, brand name on clothes torn). |\n| **Suspects** | Mrs. Hemm, the Brandt couple, the MacNodon couple, Miss Watrous, Miss Pemerton, Miss Webb, and others. Poirot suggests a circle of people who could have killed the victim. |\n| **Key characters** | Poirot (the detective), Inspector Hercule, a young officer named Pierce, a woman named Ina (or Inna) Brent, and various other residents of the street. |\n| **Plot twists** | The victim may have come to the house to die; his identity is fabricated or unknown. There are hints of a larger conspiracy involving a family (Mrs. Brand, her sister, etc.) and possible foreign connections (Canada). |\n| **Clues** | A phone call at 1:49 PM, a missing knife found near the house, a broken heel of Ina Brent, a phone booth where a girl was strangled, and a series of odd statements from witnesses. |\n| **Poirot’s method** | He emphasizes the importance of listening to casual conversations, looking for hidden motives, and piecing together seemingly unrelated details. He also references literary works and uses them as analogies for the case. |\n| **Unresolved questions** | Who killed the victim? Why did the victim come to the house? What is the significance of the “clock” and the “fake insurance agent”? Who is the “blind woman” mentioned? |\n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into a particular part of the story, a character analysis, or help with interpreting the clues, just let me know!",
