      "system_answer": "It looks like you’ve pasted a large excerpt from a mystery‑drama set on an isolated research island. The narrative follows a group of investigators—Edogawa, Sukiyama, Mariko, and others—who are trying to piece together the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Dr. Shiki, Dr. Shion, and Dr. Shinobu. Key points include:\n\n| Element | Summary |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Setting** | A remote research facility on an island, with a mix of living quarters, laboratories, and a “secret” room behind a yellow door. |\n| **Main Mystery** | Several bodies have been found: Dr. Shiki (body still in the room), Dr. Shion (hands and feet removed), and Dr. Shinobu (also mutilated). The investigators suspect foul play, possibly involving a robot or a hidden killer. |\n| **Key Characters** | - **Edogawa** – detective-like figure, trying to coordinate the investigation.<br>- **Sukiyama** – pragmatic, suggests hiding the yellow door.<br>- **Mariko, Bunshin, Naito, Naguri** – members of the investigative team.<br>- **Dr. Kusaka, Dr. Akutagawa, Dr. Makoto Shibata** – staff at the facility.<br>- **MICHIRU** – a cylindrical robot that appears in the locked room. |\n| **Suspicious Elements** | - The yellow door is locked from the inside, yet no one has entered or left the room.<br>- A robot (MICHIRU) is found inside the locked room, claiming to be “I am MICHIRU.”<br>- The bodies have been mutilated (hands and feet removed), suggesting a deliberate act.<br>- The facility’s communication systems (phone, email) are down, preventing contact with outside authorities. |\n| **Theories Discussed** | 1. **Robot‑murder** – a robot could have performed the killings and removed limbs.<br>2. **Human killer** – someone inside the facility (or a hidden intruder) might have committed the murders.<br>3. **Ghost/ supernatural** – some characters dismiss this, but it’s mentioned. |\n| **Plot Progression** | The team explores various rooms, finds the robot, and debates whether the robot could have carried out the murders. They discover that the robot can be disassembled and that the facility’s security system is compromised. The investigators are stuck on the island with no external help, and they must decide whether to wait for the police or investigate further. |\n| **Themes** | Isolation, the blurred line between human and machine, the ethics of deception (lying to the police), and the psychological toll on investigators. |\n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into a particular scene, character, or theme, or if you need help with a specific question about the text, just let me know!",

      "system_answer": "**Short Summary (≈ 200 words)**  \n\nThe passage is an excerpt from a Japanese mystery‑thriller set in a high‑tech research institute.  \n- **Red Magic** is a sophisticated computer system that secretly contains a Trojan‑horse time‑counter. When the counter reaches its limit (after seven years), the system triggers a series of pre‑programmed events that lock down the institute, disable communications, and erase logs.  \n- **Dr. Akagi (Shinobu Shiki)** orchestrated a complex escape plan. She used the Trojan to delay the system restart until 11 o’clock, giving her enough time to kill key witnesses (e.g., Mr. Yamanaka) and then flee on a boat.  \n- The narrative interweaves multiple perspectives: investigators, staff, and the victims’ families. It reveals a tangled web of motives—revenge, survival, and a twisted sense of “freedom.”  \n- The story also touches on a past tragedy involving Dr. Trueharada’s family, a “mermaid” motif, and a mysterious “mermaid” who appears to guide or warn the characters.  \n- Throughout, the plot is driven by the tension between the institute’s security protocols and the conspirators’ attempts to subvert them, culminating in a chaotic confrontation with the police and a desperate scramble to escape.  \n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into any particular character, plot point, or theme, just let me know!",
