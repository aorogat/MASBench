        "The Normans—descendants of the Viking raiders who settled in the area—were present in Normandy from the early 9th century onward, becoming a distinct people and political entity by the early 10th century.  \n\n| Key dates | What happened |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **c. 840‑860 s** | Viking raids begin along the Seine and in the surrounding marshlands. |\n| **911 – Treaty of Saint‑Clair‑sur‑Epte** | Viking leader Rollo is granted land that becomes the Duchy of Normandy; the area is officially recognized as a fief of the Frankish king. |\n| **10th century** | The Norman dukes consolidate power, Christianize the region, and establish a feudal society. |\n| **1066 – Norman Conquest of England** | William I of Normandy invades England, marking the peak of Norman influence. |\n| **12th century** | Norman rule in Normandy continues until the French crown reasserts control in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. |\n\nSo, the Normans were in Normandy roughly from the early 9th century (raids) through the 12th century, with their political and cultural peak in the 10th‑11th centuries."

      "system_answer": [
        "During the “peak” months of a political or marketing campaign, most people find themselves working well beyond a standard 40‑hour week. While the exact number can vary depending on the size of the team, the scope of the campaign, and the role you play, here are some typical ranges you’ll see:\n\n| Role | Typical weekly hours during peak season | Notes |\n|------|----------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Campaign Manager / Senior Strategist** | 50–70 hrs | Overseeing strategy, media buys, and staff coordination. |\n| **Field Organizer / Volunteer Coordinator** | 45–60 hrs | Field days, canvassing, phone banking, and volunteer training. |\n| **Communications / PR Lead** | 45–60 hrs | Drafting press releases, managing social media, and media outreach. |\n| **Data Analyst / Researcher** | 40–55 hrs | Analyzing polling data, voter files, and targeting models. |\n| **Fundraising Lead** | 45–65 hrs | Organizing events, donor outreach, and grant writing. |\n| **Volunteer / Intern** | 20–35 hrs | Often part‑time, but can be full‑time during critical periods. |\n\n### Why the hours spike\n- **Election cycles** (e.g., primaries, general elections) compress a lot of work into a few months.\n- **Key dates** (e.g., primary dates, caucuses, general election) create “crunch” periods.\n- **Media cycles** (e.g., debates, news coverage) demand rapid responses.\n\n### Managing the load\n- **Prioritize tasks**: Focus on high‑impact activities first.\n- **Delegate**: Empower team members to take ownership of smaller tasks.\n- **Set boundaries**: Even during crunch time, carve out short breaks to avoid burnout.\n- **Use technology**: Automation tools for data, scheduling, and communication can shave hours off your day.\n\n---\n\n**If you’re looking for a more precise estimate for your own situation, let me know:**\n\n- What type of campaign are you involved in (political, product launch, nonprofit, etc.)?\n- What’s your specific role or responsibilities?\n- How large is your team or organization?\n\nWith that info, I can give you a tailored ballpark figure."
