        "Hey! 🎬\n\n**It (2017)**  \n- **Plot:** The film is a remake of the 1990 classic (and the original Stephen King novel). It follows a group of childhood friends who reunite in their hometown of Derry, Maine, to confront the same malevolent entity that terrorized them as kids. This time, the creature takes the form of a terrifying clown named Pennywise, who preys on the town’s children (and adults) with a mix of supernatural powers and psychological manipulation.  \n- **Tone:** It’s a straight‑up horror movie—no stoner or comedy vibes. The film leans heavily into jump‑scares, creepy atmosphere, and the psychological terror of a childhood nightmare coming back to life.  \n- **Why it’s different from the 1990 version:** The 2017 version is more graphic and intense, with a darker, more modern take on the story. It also expands on the backstory of the town and the characters, giving the audience a deeper emotional hook.\n\nIf you’re curious about other horror films that play with similar themes (clowns, childhood trauma, supernatural terror), you might also enjoy:\n\n- **The Conjuring** (2013) – a chilling supernatural thriller.  \n- **The Babadook** (2014) – a psychological horror with a haunting mother‑child dynamic.  \n- **The Ring** (2002) – a cursed videotape that brings a slow‑burn dread.  \n- **The Shining** (1980) – a classic psychological horror set in an isolated hotel.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more recommendations or if you’re looking for something else entirely!

The adventure escalates as they try to piece together what happened, leading to even more outrageous situations and a wild, exotic backdrop.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  It ups the stakes by taking the chaos to a new, exotic location while keeping the same comedic tone.\n\n---\n\n### **The Hangover Part III (2013)**\n- **Plot:**  \n  The trio (Phil, Stu, and Doug) are on a mission to find a missing heirloom that could save their lives. They travel to New Orleans, where they encounter a series of bizarre characters and a supernatural twist. The film continues the franchise’s blend of comedy and adventure, but with a slightly darker, supernatural edge.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  It mixes the original’s humor with a new supernatural storyline, giving the series a fresh twist.\n\n---\n\n### **Super Troopers (2001)**\n- **Plot:**  \n  A group of quirky, under‑paid state troopers in a small town are more interested in pranks and petty mischief than actual law enforcement. When a serious crime threatens their town, they must step up and use their unconventional skills to solve the case—while still pulling off their signature pranks.\n- **Why it’s a hit:**  \n  The film is a cult‑classic for its absurd humor, memorable one‑liners, and the camaraderie among the troopers. It’s a great “low‑budget, high‑fun” comedy that’s become a favorite for its off‑beat style.\n\n---\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you’d like more details or other recommendations. Happy watching! 🎬"

        "Hey! 🎉\n\n**Shrek (2001)** is a great pick for a light‑hearted, “childish” movie night. Here’s the low‑down:\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Fart jokes?** | Shrek has a few classic “fart” moments (think the “farting donkey” gag and the “fart‑scented” swamp scenes), but they’re not the main focus. The humor is more about word‑play, pop‑culture references, and the lovable banter between Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona. |\n| **Eddie Murphy?** | Eddie Murphy voices Donkey, and he’s a huge part of the film’s charm. His energetic, goofy delivery brings a lot of laughs and keeps the movie fun for both kids and adults. If you’re looking for a comedic voice that’s “worth it,” Murphy definitely delivers. |\n\n**Quick recap of why Shrek is a solid choice:**\n\n- **Family‑friendly humor** with a mix of slapstick, puns, and a few mild “fart” moments that are more playful than crass.  \n- **Endearing characters**: Shrek’s gruff exterior, Donkey’s endless chatter, and Fiona’s strong personality.  \n- **Pop‑culture references**: From “The Princess Bride” nods to “The Little Mermaid” mash‑ups, it’s a treasure trove of Easter eggs.  \n- **Animation style**: The 2001 CGI look is classic and still feels fresh for a quick, nostalgic watch.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for something a bit more mature but still light‑hearted, you might also enjoy:\n\n- **The Princess Bride (1987)** – a fairy‑tale adventure with witty dialogue and a bit of romance.  \n- **The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)** – Wes Anderson’s quirky, visually‑stylish comedy‑drama (great for a slightly older audience).  \n- **The Nice Guys (2016)** – a buddy‑cop comedy with a bit of noir flair and a mature sense of humor.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more suggestions or if you’re ready to dive into Shrek! Enjoy the laughs! 🚀"

      "system_answer": [
        "**Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipe**\n\n*Serves 4*\n\n---\n\n### Ingredients\n\n| Ingredient | Amount |\n|------------|--------|\n| Boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts | 4 (about 6 oz each) |\n| Salt | ½ tsp (to taste) |\n| Black pepper | ¼ tsp (to taste) |\n| All‑purpose flour | ¼ cup (for dredging) |\n| Olive oil or neutral cooking oil | 2 Tbsp |\n| Butter | 2 Tbsp |\n| Dijon mustard | 2 Tbsp |\n| Fresh parsley, chopped (optional) | 1 Tbsp |\n| **Fillings** | |\n| Cooked ham slices | 4 (1 per breast) |\n| Swiss cheese slices | 4 (1 per breast) |\n| Bread crumbs (optional, for extra crunch) | ¼ cup |\n| Egg, beaten | 1 (for coating) |\n\n---\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Prep the chicken**  \n   - Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper.  \n   - Pound gently with a meat mallet or rolling pin until each breast is about ¼ inch thick.  \n   - Season both sides with salt and pepper.\n\n2. **Assemble the roulades**  \n   - Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard over each breast.  \n   - Lay a slice of ham and a slice of Swiss cheese on top.  \n   - Roll each breast tightly, securing with a toothpick or kitchen twine if needed.\n\n3. **Coat the roulades**  \n   - Set up a dredging station:  \n     - Bowl 1: beaten egg.  \n     - Bowl 2: flour.  \n     - Bowl 3: optional bread crumbs.  \n   - Dip each rolled breast first in flour, shaking off excess, then in egg, and finally in breadcrumbs (if using).  \n\n4. **Cook**  \n   - Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium‑high heat.  \n   - Add the chicken roulades and sear for 2–3 min per side until golden brown.  \n   - Reduce heat to medium, add the remaining 1 Tbsp butter, and spoon the melted butter over the chicken.  \n   - Cover the skillet and cook for an additional 8–10 min, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C).  \n\n5. **Rest & Serve**  \n   - Remove the toothpicks or twine.  \n   - Let the chicken rest for 5 min before slicing.  \n   - Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.  \n   - Serve with a side of roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a crisp green salad.\n\n---\n\n### Tips & Variations\n\n- **Cheese swap**: Gruyère or provolone work great if you prefer a different flavor.  \n- **Herb infusion**: Add a pinch of dried thyme or rosemary to the flour for extra aroma.  \n- **Sauce**: A simple pan sauce—deglaze the skillet with white wine or chicken broth, add a splash of cream, and simmer until thickened—pairs wonderfully.  \n- **Make‑ahead**: Assemble the roulades ahead of time, refrigerate, and cook when ready.  \n\nEnjoy your homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu!"

        "**Cool fact about LSD:**  \nLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) was first synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist **Albert Hofmann** while working at Sandoz Laboratories. He didn’t discover its psychedelic properties until 1943, when he accidentally absorbed a small amount through his fingertips and experienced a vivid, mind‑bending trip. This serendipitous “acid trip” led to the first documented psychedelic experience, and Hofmann famously described it as “the most beautiful and the most terrifying experience of my life.”"

      "system_answer": [
        "The “purpose of life” is one of the most enduring questions humanity has asked, and there isn’t a single, universally accepted answer. Different traditions—philosophical, religious, scientific, and personal—offer a variety of perspectives:\n\n| Perspective | Core Idea |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| **Religious / Spiritual** | Life’s purpose is often tied to a higher power or divine plan—e.g., to serve God, attain enlightenment, or live in harmony with a cosmic order. |\n| **Humanistic / Existential** | Purpose is self‑created. We give meaning through relationships, creativity, personal growth, and the pursuit of values that matter to us. |\n| **Biological / Evolutionary** | From a purely biological standpoint, the purpose is to survive, reproduce, and pass on genes. |\n| **Ethical / Moral** | Many argue that purpose lies in contributing to the well‑being of others—through kindness, justice, or stewardship of the planet. |\n| **Psychological** | Purpose can be a source of motivation and resilience, helping people set goals, find fulfillment, and cope with adversity. |\n\n### A Few Take‑Aways\n\n1. **It’s Personal** – What feels meaningful to one person may not to another. Your purpose can evolve over time as you learn, grow, and experience new things.\n2. **It’s Often a Process** – Many people find purpose in the journey itself—learning, helping others, creating art, or simply being present—rather than a single destination.\n3. **It Can Be Found in Small Things** – Acts of kindness, moments of connection, or moments of awe can all contribute to a sense of purpose.\n4. **It’s Not a One‑Size‑Fits‑All Answer** – You might blend ideas from different traditions, or you might find your own unique synthesis.\n\n### How to Explore Your Own Purpose\n\n- **Reflect**: Journaling, meditation, or quiet contemplation can help surface what truly matters to you.\n- **Experiment**: Try new activities, volunteer, travel, or learn a skill. Notice what feels energizing versus draining.\n- **Connect**: Talk with friends, mentors, or a counselor about what gives you a sense of meaning.\n- **Set Goals**: Even small, achievable goals can create a sense of direction and accomplishment.\n- **Revisit**: Periodically reassess your priorities; what mattered a year ago may shift as you grow.\n\nUltimately, the purpose of life is a deeply personal exploration. Many find that the act of searching itself—curiosity, growth, and connection—becomes a meaningful purpose in its own right."

      "system_answer": [
        "### Bad Habits & How to Overcome Them\n\n| Habit | Why It’s Problematic | Practical Steps to Break It |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Procrastination** | Delays important tasks, increases stress, and can lead to missed deadlines. | 1. **Set micro‑goals** – break tasks into 5‑minute chunks.<br>2. Use the **Pomodoro Technique** (25 min work + 5 min break).<br>3. Keep a visible **to‑do list** and tick items off. |\n| **Excessive Screen Time** | Can disrupt sleep, reduce productivity, and strain eyes. | 1. Use a **screen‑time tracker** (e.g., built‑in phone feature).<br>2. Set **scheduled “no‑screen” windows** (e.g., 30 min before bed).<br>3. Replace scrolling with a quick walk or stretch. |\n| **Skipping Meals / Skipping Breakfast** | Lowers energy, can lead to overeating later. | 1. Prep a simple breakfast the night before (overnight oats, fruit, yogurt).<br>2. Keep a **snack jar** with nuts or fruit to avoid skipping. |\n| **Negative Self‑Talk** | Lowers confidence, can spiral into anxiety or depression. | 1. Practice **cognitive reframing**: replace “I can’t” with “I can try.”<br>2. Keep a **gratitude journal** to shift focus to positives. |\n| **Unhealthy Eating (junk food, sugary drinks)** | Leads to weight gain, energy crashes, and long‑term health issues. | 1. Plan meals ahead; keep healthy snacks on hand.<br>2. Use the **“one‑in‑one‑out” rule**: for every junk item you buy, remove one healthy item. |\n| **Over‑committing** | Causes burnout, poor quality work, and strained relationships. | 1. Learn to say **“no”** or **“maybe later.”**<br>2. Prioritize tasks using the **Eisenhower Matrix** (urgent vs. important). |\n| **Not Getting Enough Sleep** | Impairs cognition, mood, and physical health. | 1. Set a consistent bedtime and wake‑up time.<br>2. Create a wind‑down routine (dim lights, read, avoid screens). |\n| **Smoking / Excessive Alcohol** | Health risks, addiction, and financial cost. | 1. Seek support groups (e.g., 12‑step, counseling).<br>2. Replace the habit with a healthier activity (exercise, hobby). |\n| **Avoiding Physical Activity** | Leads to weight gain, decreased energy, and health risks. | 1. Schedule a **short daily walk** (10–15 min).<br>2. Use a **fitness app** to track progress and stay motivated. |\n| **Poor Time Management** | Missed deadlines, increased stress. | 1. Use a **calendar** or planner.<br>2. Block time for specific tasks (time‑blocking).<br>3. Review and adjust weekly. |\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Action Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Habit** – Pick one that’s most affecting you.\n2. **Set a Clear Goal** – e.g., “I will stop checking my phone for 30 minutes after meals.”\n3. **Create a Trigger** – Pair the new behavior with an existing routine (e.g., “after brushing my teeth, I’ll do a 5‑minute stretch”).\n4. **Track Progress** – Use a habit‑tracking app or a simple checklist.\n5. **Reward Yourself** – Celebrate small wins (e.g., a favorite treat after a week of success).\n6. **Seek Accountability** – Share your goal with a friend or use a habit‑tracking buddy.\n\n---\n\n#### Resources\n\n- **Apps**: Habitica, Streaks, HabitBull, or the built‑in “Habits” feature on many phones.  \n- **Books**: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg.  \n- **Support**: Talk to a therapist, join a support group, or use online communities (Reddit’s r/NoFap, r/HealthyHabits, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Breaking a habit takes time and persistence. Start small, stay consistent, and celebrate each step forward. Good luck!"

      "system_answer": [
        "Mining for gold on public land is possible, but it’s heavily regulated and not as simple as just heading out with a shovel. Here’s a quick rundown of what you’ll need to know:\n\n| Step | What to Do | Why It Matters |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| **1. Identify the land** | Public land can be managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), National Forests, or other federal agencies. | Different agencies have different rules. |\n| **2. Check the land’s status** | Some areas are open for mining, others are protected (e.g., wilderness, wildlife refuges). | Mining is prohibited in many protected zones. |\n| **3. Obtain the right permits** | • **Mining claim** (if you’re staking a claim) <br>• **Mining lease** (if you’re leasing land) <br>• **Surface mining permit** (for larger operations) | Permits are required to legally extract minerals. |\n| **4. Follow environmental regulations** | • **Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)** or **Environmental Assessment (EA)** <br>• **Water use permits** (if you’ll be using water) | Mining can impact water quality, wildlife, and ecosystems. |\n| **5. Pay fees** | Fees vary by agency and the size of the claim or lease. | Fees help cover land management and monitoring. |\n| **6. Comply with local rules** | Some states or counties have additional regulations or require local permits. | Local rules can add extra layers of compliance. |\n\n### Quick Tips\n- **Start with the BLM website**: They have a “Mining” section where you can search for open‑mining opportunities and find the application forms.  \n- **Use the USFS “Mining” page** if you’re in a national forest.  \n- **Check the “Mineral Management” section** of the state’s natural resources department for state‑level rules.  \n- **Consider a small‑scale, hobbyist approach**: Many people start with a “panning” or “sluicing” kit on public land that’s open for recreational mining. This usually requires only a basic permit or a “mining claim” if you plan to stake a claim.\n\n### Bottom Line\nYou can mine for gold on public land, but you’ll need to:\n1. Identify the correct land and its status.  \n2. Apply for the appropriate permits.  \n3. Follow all environmental and local regulations.  \n\nIf you’re serious about it, the first step is to visit the BLM or USFS website for the specific area you’re interested in and download the relevant application forms. Good luck, and happy prospecting!"

      "system_answer": [
        "The Sun itself isn’t actually yellow—it emits a nearly **white** spectrum of light.  \nWhat makes the Sun look yellow to us on Earth is the way that light travels through our atmosphere:\n\n1. **Rayleigh scattering**  \n   The atmosphere contains molecules and very small particles that scatter shorter‑wavelength light (blue and violet) more strongly than longer‑wavelength light (red, orange, yellow).  \n   When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue component is scattered in all directions, leaving the remaining light that reaches our eyes richer in the longer wavelengths.\n\n2. **Air mass and viewing angle**  \n   - **At noon** (when the Sun is high in the sky) the light path through the atmosphere is short, so only a modest amount of blue is scattered away. The Sun still looks white or slightly yellowish.  \n   - **During sunrise or sunset** the light travels through a much longer path, scattering even more blue light out of the line of sight. The light that reaches us is dominated by the yellow‑red part of the spectrum, so the Sun appears orange or red.\n\n3. **Human perception**  \n   Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑green light, and the presence of scattered blue light can make the Sun look slightly yellowish even when it is high in the sky.\n\nSo, the Sun is essentially white; it appears yellow (or orange/red at dawn/dusk) because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters the shorter‑wavelength blue light away from our line of sight."

        "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and many other livestock species).  \n\n| Key points | Details |\n|------------|---------|\n| **Causative agent** | A picornavirus of the *Picornaviridae* family, genus *Aphthovirus* (the most common strain is serotype O). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 40 °C) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that break to form ulcers on the mouth, tongue, and inside the lips <br>• Swelling of the feet, hooves, and teats <br>• Reduced appetite, weight loss, and decreased milk production (in dairy cattle) <br>• In some species, lameness and difficulty standing. |\n| **Incubation period** | 2–14 days (usually 4–7 days). |\n| **Impact** | • Economic losses from reduced productivity, trade restrictions, and costs of control measures. <br>• Infected herds may be quarantined or slaughtered to prevent spread. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Strict biosecurity: quarantine new animals, disinfect equipment, restrict movement of animals and people. <br>• Vaccination (live or inactivated vaccines) is used in many countries, but vaccination alone cannot prevent outbreaks. <br>• Rapid reporting and culling of infected animals are essential in many regions. |\n| **Human infection** | Rare; humans can become infected through close contact with infected animals or contaminated materials, but the disease is not usually transmitted from person to person. |\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a major concern for the global livestock industry because of its high transmissibility and the severe economic consequences of an outbreak."

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound and then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects such as fish, submarines, the sea floor, or other obstacles.\n\n### How sonar works\n\n| Step | What happens | Key concept |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1. **Transmission** | A transducer (speaker‑like device) sends out a sound pulse (often in the range of 1 kHz to several hundred kHz). | **Pulse‑echo** |\n| 2. **Propagation** | The sound travels through water, which transmits sound much better than air. | Speed of sound ≈ 1,500 m/s in seawater |\n| 3. **Reflection** | The pulse hits an object and reflects back toward the source. | **Echo** |\n| 4. **Reception** | The same transducer (or a separate receiver) picks up the returning echo. | **Time‑of‑flight** |\n| 5. **Processing** | The time delay between transmission and reception is converted into distance (range). The echo’s frequency shift (Doppler effect) can reveal the target’s speed. | **Range & velocity** |\n| 6. **Display** | The processed data are shown on a screen or plotted on a map, giving the operator a “picture” of the underwater environment. | **Sonar imaging** |\n\n### Types of sonar\n\n| Type | Purpose | Typical use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Navigation, fish‑finding, submarine detection, depth sounding. |\n| **Passive sonar** | Only listens for sounds made by other objects (e.g., propeller noise). | Stealth detection, marine biology studies. |\n| **Side‑scan sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to create detailed images of the sea floor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys. |\n| **Multibeam sonar** | Sends multiple beams to map large areas quickly. | Bathymetric mapping, offshore construction. |\n\n### Applications\n\n- **Naval**: submarine detection, mine‑sweeping, navigation.\n- **Commercial**: fishing (fish‑finder), shipping navigation, offshore oil & gas.\n- **Scientific**: mapping the ocean floor, studying marine life, monitoring ice sheets.\n- **Recreational**: fishing, diving, boating.\n\n### Why it’s useful\n\n- Sound travels far in water, so sonar can detect objects hundreds or thousands of meters away.\n- It works in all visibility conditions (murky water, darkness, ice).\n- Provides real‑time information about depth, distance, and movement.\n\nIn short, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound waves instead of radio waves to “see” what lies beneath the surface."

        "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain, tenderness, and fatigue. It is considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning the nervous system amplifies pain signals.  \n\n| Key features | Details |\n|--------------|---------|\n| **Pain** | Often described as a deep, aching, or “burning” sensation that can affect the whole body (neck, shoulders, back, hips, knees, etc.). |\n| **Tender points** | Traditionally, 18 specific spots on the body (e.g., the base of the skull, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees) are especially sensitive to pressure. |\n| **Fatigue** | Persistent tiredness that is not relieved by sleep or rest. |\n| **Sleep problems** | Many people have difficulty falling or staying asleep, and may wake up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Trouble concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, depression or anxiety, and sensitivity to light, sound, or temperature. |\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n- **Genetics**: Family history increases risk.  \n- **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger or worsen symptoms.  \n- **Infections**: Some viral or bacterial infections have been linked to onset.  \n- **Trauma**: Physical injury or emotional trauma can precipitate the condition.  \n- **Sleep disturbances**: Poor sleep quality can exacerbate pain and fatigue.\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Medical history & physical exam**: Checking for tender points and ruling out other conditions.  \n- **Criteria**: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a combination of widespread pain index and symptom severity score.  \n- **Lab tests**: Usually to exclude other diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).\n\n### Treatment\n- **Medications**:  \n  - *Pain relievers* (acetaminophen, NSAIDs).  \n  - *Antidepressants* (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran) to reduce pain and improve mood.  \n  - *Anticonvulsants* (gabapentin, pregabalin) for nerve‑related pain.  \n- **Lifestyle changes**:  \n  - Regular low‑impact exercise (walking, swimming, yoga).  \n  - Stress‑management techniques (mindfulness, CBT, relaxation).  \n  - Good sleep hygiene.  \n- **Physical therapy**: Strengthening and stretching to improve function.  \n- **Alternative therapies**: Acupuncture, massage, tai chi, and certain supplements (e.g., magnesium, vitamin D) may help some people.\n\n### Prognosis\nFibromyalgia is a lifelong condition, but symptoms can be managed. With a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and support, many people experience significant relief and can maintain an active, productive life.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that produces widespread aches, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties, often triggered or worsened by stress, injury, or infection. It is managed through a mix of medication, exercise, sleep improvement, and stress‑reduction strategies."

        "**Plastic is made from long chains of molecules called polymers.**  \nThese polymers are built from smaller units called *monomers* that are chemically bonded together in a repeating pattern. The basic ingredients and steps are:\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical materials |\n|------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **1. Feedstock** | Raw materials (usually petroleum‑derived hydrocarbons or natural gas) are processed into simple molecules. | Ethylene, propylene, butadiene, styrene, etc. |\n| **2. Polymerization** | Monomers are linked together through chemical reactions (addition or condensation polymerization). | Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), etc. |\n| **3. Additives** | Various chemicals are mixed in to give the plastic desired properties (color, flexibility, flame resistance, etc.). | Plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, impact modifiers, flame retardants. |\n| **4. Shaping** | The polymer melt or powder is formed into the final product by extrusion, injection molding, blow‑molding, or other processes. | Bottles, containers, toys, packaging, automotive parts, etc. |\n\n### Key points\n\n- **Polymers** are long, repeating chains of atoms; the specific arrangement determines the plastic’s characteristics (rigidity, toughness, transparency, etc.).\n- **Monomers** are the building blocks; they can be derived from fossil fuels (most common) or from renewable sources (e.g., corn‑derived ethylene for some bioplastics).\n- **Additives** tailor the material for a particular use—e.g., adding a plasticizer makes PVC flexible, while a stabilizer prevents yellowing from sunlight.\n- **Recycling** involves breaking the polymer chains back into smaller fragments (often the same monomers) and re‑polymerizing them, though the process can degrade the material’s quality over time.\n\nSo, in short, plastic is made from polymer chains built from monomers, with additives and processing steps that give each type of plastic its unique properties."

      "question": "What is the criterion for being legally blind ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Legally blind** is a legal definition used by governments, insurance companies, and disability‑benefit programs to determine eligibility for services, benefits, and accommodations.  \nWhile the exact wording can vary by country, the most widely cited standard in the United States (and many other jurisdictions) is:\n\n| Criterion | Threshold | What it means |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Best‑corrected visual acuity** | 20/200 or worse in the better eye | Even with glasses or contact lenses, the eye can’t see at 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see at 200 ft. |\n| **Or visual field** | 20° or less (or a “tunnel” field) | The eye’s peripheral vision is severely narrowed, even if central acuity is better than 20/200. |\n\nIf **either** of these conditions is met, a person is considered legally blind.  \nIn practice, the determination is made by an eye‑care professional (optometrist or ophthalmologist) who performs:\n\n1. **Visual‑acuity test** (Snellen chart, logMAR chart, etc.) with the best possible correction.  \n2. **Visual‑field test** (e.g., Humphrey perimetry) to assess peripheral vision.\n\n### Why the two measures?\n\n- **Acuity** captures loss of sharpness (e.g., cataracts, macular degeneration).  \n- **Field** captures loss of peripheral vision (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma).  \nBoth can impair daily functioning, so either alone can qualify someone for legal blindness.\n\n### Other countries\n\n| Country | Common definition |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Canada** | 20/200 or worse in the better eye, or a visual field of 20° or less. |\n| **UK** | 6/60 (≈ 20/200) or worse in the better eye, or a visual field of 20° or less. |\n| **Australia** | 6/60 or worse, or a visual field of 20° or less. |\n| **India** | 20/200 or worse, or a visual field of 20° or less. |\n\n### Practical implications\n\n- **Disability benefits** (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance in the U.S.) require a medical certification of legal blindness.  \n- **Accessibility**: Public transportation, signage, and building codes often have specific requirements for people who are legally blind.  \n- **Assistive technology**: Screen readers, magnifiers, and other aids are typically available for those who meet the legal definition.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA person is legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity is 20/200 or worse in the better eye **or** their visual field is 20° or less. This definition is used to qualify for legal protections, benefits, and accommodations."

        "A **prism** is a solid object—usually made of glass or clear plastic—whose faces are flat and typically angled so that light entering one face is bent (refracted) as it passes through the material.  \n\n### Key features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Flat faces** | At least two faces are flat and parallel (or at a fixed angle). |\n| **Transparent material** | Commonly glass or acrylic; the material must transmit light. |\n| **Refractive index** | Determines how much the light bends; glass ≈ 1.5, plastic ≈ 1.4. |\n| **Angle between faces** | Usually 60°, 90°, or 120°, but can be any value. |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Incidence** – Light strikes the first face at some angle.  \n2. **Refraction** – The light slows down in the denser medium and bends toward the normal (Snell’s law).  \n3. **Transmission** – Light travels through the prism.  \n4. **Exit** – Light refracts again at the second face, emerging at a different direction.\n\nBecause the amount of bending depends on the wavelength, a prism can separate white light into its component colors (a spectrum). This is why prisms are used in spectrometers, binoculars, and many optical instruments.\n\n### Common types\n\n| Type | Typical use |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Triangular prism** | Splits light into a spectrum; used in spectrometers and optical devices. |\n| **Beam‑steering prism** | Directs a beam of light to a desired angle; used in laser pointers and projectors. |\n| **Prismatic lens** | Combines a lens and a prism to correct aberrations or change beam direction. |\n\n### Everyday examples\n\n- The triangular glass in a classic “prism” toy that shows a rainbow.  \n- The prism in a binocular that bends the light path to fit the eyepiece.  \n- The small prism in a camera’s viewfinder that redirects the image to the eye.\n\nIn short, a prism is a simple, flat‑sided optical element that bends light, often used to split or redirect beams for scientific, photographic, or everyday purposes."

      "system_answer": [
        "**CC** in an engine stands for **cubic centimeters**—the unit used to express the engine’s *displacement*.\n\n### What it means\n\n- **Engine displacement** is the total volume of all the cylinders in an engine, measured in cubic centimeters (cc) or liters (L).  \n- It’s calculated by multiplying the bore (diameter) by the stroke (distance the piston travels) for each cylinder, then summing across all cylinders.\n\n| Example | Formula | Result |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| 4‑cylinder engine, bore = 80 mm, stroke = 70 mm | \\(V = \\pi \\times (bore/2)^2 \\times stroke \\times 4\\) | ≈ 1 600 cc (1.6 L) |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Power & torque**: Generally, a larger displacement allows more air‑fuel mixture to be combusted, producing more power and torque (though modern engines use turbocharging, direct injection, etc., to boost performance without increasing displacement).\n- **Fuel consumption**: Bigger engines tend to consume more fuel, though efficiency improvements can offset this.\n- **Regulations & taxes**: Many countries tax or regulate vehicles based on engine displacement (e.g., “cc tax” in India).\n\n### Common usage\n\n- **Motorcycles**: 125 cc, 250 cc, 600 cc, 1000 cc, etc.  \n- **Cars**: 1.6 L (1600 cc), 2.0 L (2000 cc), 3.5 L (3500 cc), etc.  \n- **Bicycles**: “cc” is rarely used; instead, “cc” might refer to the volume of a cylinder in a small engine (e.g., a 50 cc scooter).\n\n### Quick reference\n\n| Engine size | Approx. cc | Typical vehicle |\n|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| 125 cc | 125 | Small scooter or motorcycle |\n| 250 cc | 250 | Entry‑level motorcycle |\n| 600 cc | 600 | Mid‑size motorcycle |\n| 1.0 L | 1000 | Small car or compact SUV |\n| 2.0 L | 2000 | Standard sedan |\n| 3.5 L | 3500 | Performance or luxury car |\n\n**Bottom line:** In engines, “cc” is a shorthand for cubic centimeters, the measure of the engine’s total cylinder volume, which gives a quick sense of its size and potential power."

      "system_answer": [
        "**An ulcer** is a localized area of tissue damage in which the surface layer (epithelium) is eroded or destroyed, exposing deeper layers.  The term is most often used for two common types:\n\n| Type | Typical location | Main cause | Key symptoms |\n|------|------------------|------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic (gastric or duodenal) ulcer** | Stomach lining or first part of small intestine | • *Helicobacter pylori* infection<br>• Chronic use of NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen)<br>• Excess stomach acid | Burning epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, sometimes vomiting blood |\n| **Canker (mouth) ulcer** | Oral mucosa (inside lips, cheeks, tongue) | • Minor trauma, stress, hormonal changes, vitamin deficiencies, immune factors | Painful, shallow sore, often heals in 1–2 weeks |\n\n### How an ulcer forms\n\n1. **Barrier breakdown** – The protective mucus layer or epithelial cells are damaged.  \n2. **Acid or enzyme exposure** – In the stomach, gastric acid or pepsin erodes the tissue; in the mouth, mechanical irritation or infection does the same.  \n3. **Inflammatory response** – The body attempts to heal, but ongoing damage can keep the ulcer open.\n\n### Common risk factors\n\n- **Helicobacter pylori** infection (≈ 50 % of peptic ulcers).  \n- **NSAID use** (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen).  \n- **Smoking** and **heavy alcohol** use.  \n- **Stress** (especially in hospitalized or ICU patients).  \n- **Genetics** (family history of ulcers).  \n- **Autoimmune conditions** (e.g., Crohn’s disease).  \n\n### Diagnosis\n\n- **Endoscopy** (visual inspection of stomach/duodenum).  \n- **Biopsy** for H. pylori testing.  \n- **Urea breath test** or stool antigen test for H. pylori.  \n- **Oral exam** for canker sores.  \n\n### Treatment\n\n| Condition | Typical therapy |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Peptic ulcer** | • **Antibiotics** to eradicate H. pylori (usually 2‑drug or 3‑drug regimens).<br>• **Proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs)** (omeprazole, esomeprazole) to reduce acid.<br>• **H₂‑blockers** (ranitidine, famotidine) as alternatives.<br>• **Antacids** for symptomatic relief.<br>• **Lifestyle changes**: avoid NSAIDs, limit alcohol, quit smoking. |\n| **Canker ulcer** | • Topical numbing agents (benzocaine).<br>• Anti‑inflammatory gels (corticosteroid mouthwash).<br>• Good oral hygiene, avoid spicy/acidic foods.<br>• Treat underlying deficiencies (B12, folate, iron) if present. |\n\n### Prognosis\n\n- **Peptic ulcers**: With appropriate therapy, healing occurs in 4–8 weeks; recurrence risk is low if H. pylori is eradicated and NSAIDs avoided.  \n- **Canker ulcers**: Usually self‑limited, healing in 1–2 weeks; chronic or recurrent cases may need systemic therapy.\n\n### When to seek medical help\n\n- Severe or worsening pain, especially after eating.  \n- Vomiting blood or black, tarry stools (signs of bleeding).  \n- Persistent sore that lasts > 2 weeks.  \n- Symptoms of anemia (fatigue, pallor) or weight loss.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** An ulcer is a localized tissue erosion—most commonly a peptic ulcer in the stomach or duodenum, or a canker sore in the mouth—caused by acid, infection, medication, or trauma. It presents with pain and can be diagnosed and effectively treated with antibiotics, acid‑suppressing drugs, and lifestyle changes."

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atoms form bonds by mixing (or “hybridizing”) their atomic orbitals to create new, equivalent orbitals that are better suited for bonding. It’s the reason why molecules like methane (CH₄) have tetrahedral shapes, water (H₂O) has a bent shape, and why carbon can form four single bonds, two double bonds, or a triple bond, all with the same valence electrons.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why hybridization is useful\n\n- **Orbital shapes**: Pure atomic orbitals (s, p, d, f) have fixed shapes that don’t always match the geometry of a molecule.\n- **Bonding directionality**: Molecules often need orbitals that point in specific directions (e.g., 90°, 109.5°, 120°) to form σ‑bonds.\n- **Energy considerations**: Mixing orbitals can lower the energy of the system, making the molecule more stable.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The basic idea\n\nAn atom’s valence electrons occupy orbitals (s, p, d). When the atom forms bonds, those orbitals can mix to produce **hybrid orbitals** that:\n\n- Are **equivalent** (same energy, same shape).\n- Are **oriented** in a way that matches the molecule’s geometry.\n- Can form σ‑bonds with other atoms.\n\nThe number of hybrid orbitals equals the number of orbitals that mix. The resulting hybrid orbitals are labeled by the type of hybridization:\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example |\n|---------------|----------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, ethylene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ (after lone‑pair adjustment) |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to determine hybridization\n\n1. **Count the regions of electron density** around the central atom (bonding pairs + lone pairs).  \n2. **Match that number** to a hybridization type:\n   - 2 → sp\n   - 3 → sp²\n   - 4 → sp³\n   - 5 → sp³d\n   - 6 → sp³d²\n3. **Adjust for lone pairs**: Lone pairs occupy the same hybrid orbitals as bonds but don’t contribute to bond angles.\n\n### Example: Water (H₂O)\n\n- Oxygen has 2 bonding pairs (to H) + 2 lone pairs = 4 regions → **sp³ hybridization**.  \n- The two lone pairs push the H–O–H bond angle down from 109.5° to ~104.5°.\n\n### Example: Ethylene (C₂H₄)\n\n- Each carbon has 3 regions (2 C–H bonds + 1 C=C double bond) → **sp² hybridization**.  \n- The double bond consists of one σ‑bond (sp²–sp²) and one π‑bond (unhybridized p–p overlap).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hybridization vs. “real” orbitals\n\n- **Hybrid orbitals** are a *model* that helps explain geometry and bonding.  \n- In reality, the electron density is a mixture of atomic orbitals; the hybridization picture is a useful approximation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common misconceptions\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|---------|\n| “Hybridization is a real physical process.” | It’s a conceptual tool; the actual electron distribution is a quantum mechanical superposition. |\n| “All atoms in a molecule are hybridized.” | Only the atoms that form bonds (usually the central atom) are described by hybrid orbitals. |\n| “Hybridization determines bond strength.” | Bond strength depends on orbital overlap, electronegativity, and other factors; hybridization mainly explains geometry. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick reference table\n\n| Atom | Regions of electron density | Hybridization | Geometry | Typical bond angles |\n|------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------|---------------------|\n| Be | 2 | sp | Linear | 180° |\n| B | 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 120° |\n| C | 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| P | 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n| S | 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 90° |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a way to describe how atoms mix their s, p, (and sometimes d) orbitals to form new, directionally oriented orbitals that match the geometry of a molecule. It explains why molecules have the shapes they do and how atoms can form multiple bonds with the same valence electrons."

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Short answer:**  \nAfter you drink, alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream in a matter of minutes—most of it reaches the blood within **30–90 minutes** of consumption. The exact speed depends on how much you drink, how fast you drink it, whether your stomach is empty, and a few individual factors (body weight, gender, metabolism, etc.).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Where absorption happens\n\n| Site | What happens | Typical contribution |\n|------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Stomach** | Alcohol dissolves in gastric fluid and is absorbed through the stomach lining. | ~20–30 % of the total dose |\n| **Small intestine** | The majority of alcohol is absorbed here because the intestinal wall is highly vascularized. | ~70–80 % of the total dose |\n| **Large intestine** | Very little absorption; most alcohol is excreted in feces. | < 5 % |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Timing\n\n| Stage | Typical time after drinking | What you’ll feel |\n|-------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| **First absorption** | 5–10 min | Slight buzz, mild intoxication |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | 30–90 min (average ~45 min) | Highest intoxication level |\n| **Plateau** | 1–2 h | BAC may stay relatively flat if you keep drinking |\n| **Elimination** | ~1–2 h per 0.02 % BAC | Gradual return to baseline |\n\n> **Key point:** The *peak* BAC is usually reached **within the first hour** after you start drinking.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Factors that change the absorption rate\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Amount of alcohol** | Larger drinks → higher peak BAC, but the *rate* of absorption stays roughly the same. |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑proof drinks (e.g., 40 % ABV vs. 5 % beer) reach peak BAC faster. |\n| **Rate of drinking** | Sipping slowly spreads absorption over a longer period; gulping quickly spikes BAC sooner. |\n| **Food in the stomach** | Food, especially fatty or protein‑rich meals, slows gastric emptying → slower absorption. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Heavier people have more blood volume → lower peak BAC for the same dose. |\n| **Gender** | Women generally have less body water and lower alcohol‑dehydrogenase activity → higher BAC for the same dose. |\n| **Metabolism** | Genetic variations in alcohol‑dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) can speed or slow elimination. |\n| **Alcohol tolerance** | Regular drinkers may metabolize alcohol slightly faster, but absorption rate is largely unchanged. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typical numbers\n\n| Drink | Volume | ABV | Approx. time to peak BAC | Approx. peak BAC (average male) |\n|-------|--------|-----|--------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 12 oz beer (5 % ABV) | 355 mL | 5 % | 45–60 min | 0.04–0.06 % |\n| 5 oz wine (12 % ABV) | 148 mL | 12 % | 30–45 min | 0.05–0.07 % |\n| 1.5 oz spirits (40 % ABV) | 44 mL | 40 % | 20–30 min | 0.07–0.10 % |\n\n> **Note:** These are averages; individual results vary widely.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How fast is it *eliminated*?\n\n- The body metabolizes alcohol at roughly **0.015 % BAC per hour** (≈ 0.1 g of alcohol per kilogram of body weight per hour).  \n- This elimination rate is *independent* of how fast it was absorbed; it’s a separate process.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom line\n\n- **Absorption**: Most alcohol reaches the bloodstream within **30–90 minutes** after you start drinking.  \n- **Peak BAC**: Usually occurs around **45 minutes** after consumption.  \n- **Rate**: Depends on drink type, amount, rate of drinking, food, body weight, gender, and metabolism.  \n\nIf you’re planning to drive or perform tasks that require full alertness, remember that the peak intoxication window is typically within the first hour after you start drinking."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Strep throat** is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused almost exclusively by the bacterium *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A streptococcus). It is one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adolescents, but adults can get it too.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How it happens\n\n| Step | What occurs |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Exposure** | You inhale or ingest the bacteria, often from an infected person’s cough, sneeze, or shared utensils. |\n| **Colonization** | The bacteria attach to the mucous membranes of the throat and begin to multiply. |\n| **Inflammation** | The immune system responds, causing redness, swelling, and pain. |\n| **Symptoms** | The infection spreads to the tonsils and surrounding tissues, producing the classic strep‑throat picture. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Sore throat** | Sudden, severe pain that worsens with swallowing. |\n| **Fever** | Usually > 38 °C (100.4 °F). |\n| **Red, swollen tonsils** | Often with white or yellow patches (exudates). |\n| **Tiny red spots** on the soft palate (“petechiae”). |\n| **Swollen, tender lymph nodes** in the neck. |\n| **Headache, body aches, nausea** (especially in children). |\n| **No cough or runny nose** (distinguishes it from viral sore throat). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n1. **Rapid antigen test** – Gives results in 5–15 minutes.  \n2. **Throat culture** – Gold standard; takes 24–48 hours but confirms the diagnosis and checks for antibiotic resistance.  \n3. **Clinical criteria** (e.g., Centor score) – Helps decide whether testing is needed.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Treatment | Why it matters |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Antibiotics** (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) | Eradicates the bacteria, reduces symptoms, prevents complications (e.g., rheumatic fever), and stops contagiousness after ~24 hours. |\n| **Pain relievers** (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) | Relieve pain and fever. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Support recovery. |\n| **Avoiding irritants** (smoke, dry air) | Helps soothe the throat. |\n\n*If you’re allergic to penicillin, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) or cephalosporins are alternatives.*\n\n---\n\n## 5. When to seek medical care\n\n- Fever > 38 °C (100.4 °F) lasting > 48 hours.  \n- Severe pain or difficulty swallowing.  \n- Signs of dehydration or inability to keep fluids down.  \n- Persistent sore throat > 7 days.  \n- Any signs of complications (e.g., joint pain, rash, chest pain).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Prevention\n\n- **Hand hygiene** – Wash hands frequently, especially after coughing or sneezing.  \n- **Avoid close contact** with infected individuals.  \n- **Cover coughs/sneezes** with a tissue or elbow.  \n- **Do not share** utensils, cups, or towels.  \n- **Vaccination** – No vaccine for strep throat, but keeping up with routine vaccines (e.g., flu shot) reduces overall respiratory infections.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial infection of the throat caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It presents with a sudden, painful sore throat, fever, swollen tonsils, and tender lymph nodes, but no cough. Rapid diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are key to relieving symptoms, preventing complications, and stopping the spread."

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Poliomyelitis (polio)** is a viral disease that attacks the nervous system, most often the motor neurons that control muscle movement. It is caused by the **polio virus** (an enterovirus of the *Picornaviridae* family). The virus is usually spread through the fecal‑oral route (contaminated food or water) and can also be transmitted via respiratory droplets.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the disease works\n\n1. **Entry** – The virus infects the intestinal lining and replicates there.  \n2. **Viremia** – It then enters the bloodstream and can spread to the central nervous system (CNS).  \n3. **Neurotropism** – The virus preferentially infects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem.  \n4. **Damage** – Infected neurons die, leading to loss of muscle control.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clinical presentation\n\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (up to 3 weeks). Usually asymptomatic. |\n| **Early (non‑paralytic) phase** | Low‑grade fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild headache, nausea, and sometimes a mild rash. |\n| **Paralytic phase** | Rapid onset of muscle weakness that can progress to paralysis. Commonly affects the legs first, but can involve the arms, diaphragm, or other muscles. |\n| **Recovery** | Some patients recover fully; others may have permanent muscle weakness or paralysis. |\n\n- **Non‑paralytic polio**: ~95 % of infections; mild or no symptoms.  \n- **Paralytic polio**: ~5 % of infections; can cause permanent paralysis or death (if respiratory muscles are involved).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical assessment** of symptoms and neurological exam.  \n- **Laboratory tests**:  \n  - *Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)* or *virus isolation* from stool, throat swab, or CSF.  \n  - *Serology* (antibody detection) is less useful for acute diagnosis.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n- **Supportive care**:  \n  - Pain management, physiotherapy, and respiratory support (ventilation) if breathing is compromised.  \n  - Early use of **polio‑specific immunoglobulin** (in some countries) can reduce severity if given within 48 hours of symptom onset.  \n- **No antiviral**: There is no specific antiviral therapy for polio.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n- **Vaccination** – The cornerstone of polio control.  \n  - **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)**: given orally or by injection; used in many countries.  \n  - **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)**: live attenuated vaccine; used in mass‑campaigns in developing countries.  \n- **Sanitation** – Clean water, proper sewage disposal, and hand hygiene reduce transmission.  \n- **Surveillance** – Monitoring for cases and environmental sampling of sewage helps detect outbreaks early.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Global status\n\n- **Eradication**: Polio has been eliminated in most of the world. Only a few countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and a few islands) still report cases.  \n- **Outbreaks**: Sporadic outbreaks can still occur, especially where vaccination coverage is low.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPoliomyelitis is a viral infection that can cause paralysis by destroying motor neurons. It spreads via contaminated food or water, and most infections are mild or asymptomatic. The disease is preventable with vaccination, and global efforts have nearly eradicated it."

      "question": "What is the temperature at the center of the earth ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Temperature at the center of the Earth**\n\n| Layer | Approximate temperature |\n|-------|--------------------------|\n| **Inner core (solid iron‑nickel)** | **≈ 5 500 – 6 000 °C** (≈ 5 800 – 6 300 K) |\n| **Outer core (liquid iron‑nickel)** | **≈ 4 000 – 5 500 °C** (≈ 4 300 – 5 800 K) |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The very center of the Earth—the solid inner core—is estimated to be around **5 500 °C (≈ 5 800 K)**, with the surrounding liquid outer core slightly cooler.\n\n---\n\n### How scientists estimate it\n\n1. **Seismic wave speeds**  \n   - P‑waves (compressional) travel fastest through the solid inner core.  \n   - By measuring how fast these waves move and comparing to laboratory data on iron at high pressure, scientists infer temperature.\n\n2. **Laboratory experiments**  \n   - Diamond‑anvil cells and shock‑compression experiments replicate core pressures (~3.5 million bar).  \n   - Iron’s melting point rises with pressure; extrapolations give the inner‑core temperature.\n\n3. **Geodynamo models**  \n   - The Earth’s magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core.  \n   - Models that reproduce the field’s strength and pattern constrain the temperature gradient.\n\n4. **Heat flow measurements**  \n   - Surface heat flow (~0.07 W m⁻²) combined with mantle convection models supports the ~5–6 kK estimate.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Magnetic field**: The temperature difference between inner and outer core drives convection, sustaining Earth’s magnetic field.  \n- **Core composition**: Temperature determines whether the core is solid or liquid and influences the distribution of light elements (e.g., sulfur, oxygen).  \n- **Planetary evolution**: Core cooling over billions of years shapes Earth’s thermal history and tectonic activity.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference\n\n- **Inner core**: ~5 500 °C (≈ 5 800 K)  \n- **Outer core**: ~4 000 – 5 500 °C (≈ 4 300 – 5 800 K)  \n- **Mantle**: ~1 300 – 4 000 °C (≈ 1 600 – 4 300 K)  \n- **Surface**: ~0 °C (273 K) to ~1 200 °C (≈ 1 470 K) in volcanic regions\n\nThese values are averages; local variations exist, but the inner core’s temperature is consistently around **5.5 k°C**."

      "question": "What is neurology ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Neurology** is the branch of medicine that focuses on the nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves—and the disorders that affect them. It is both a clinical specialty (diagnosing and treating patients) and a research field (studying how the nervous system works).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What does a neurologist do?\n\n| Area | Typical activities |\n|------|--------------------|\n| **Diagnosis** | Use history, physical exam, and tests (EEG, EMG, MRI, CT, lumbar puncture) to identify conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, neuropathies, and headaches. |\n| **Treatment** | Prescribe medications, coordinate rehabilitation, and sometimes perform procedures (e.g., spinal taps, nerve blocks). |\n| **Management** | Provide long‑term care for chronic neurological diseases, monitor disease progression, and adjust therapies. |\n| **Research** | Investigate mechanisms of neural function, develop new diagnostics, and test novel treatments. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key neurological disorders\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Cerebrovascular** | Stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation. |\n| **Neurodegenerative** | Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease. |\n| **Epilepsy & seizures** | Focal seizures, generalized seizures, status epilepticus. |\n| **Movement disorders** | Tremor, dystonia, chorea. |\n| **Peripheral neuropathies** | Diabetic neuropathy, Guillain‑Barré syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome. |\n| **Headache disorders** | Migraine, tension‑type headache, cluster headache. |\n| **Neuro‑oncology** | Brain tumors, spinal cord tumors. |\n| **Neuro‑immunology** | Multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica. |\n| **Neuro‑psychiatric** | Depression, anxiety, dementia, sleep disorders. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How is neurology practiced?\n\n1. **Clinical evaluation** – Detailed history (symptom onset, progression, family history) + neurological exam (motor, sensory, reflexes, coordination, cranial nerves).  \n2. **Diagnostic testing** –  \n   - **Imaging**: MRI, CT, MR angiography.  \n   - **Electrophysiology**: EEG (brain activity), EMG/NCS (nerve/muscle function).  \n   - **Lumbar puncture**: CSF analysis for infections, inflammation, or malignancy.  \n3. **Treatment plans** – Medications (anticonvulsants, dopaminergic agents, steroids), lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and sometimes surgical interventions (e.g., deep brain stimulation, aneurysm clipping).  \n4. **Follow‑up** – Regular monitoring of disease progression, side‑effects, and adjustment of therapy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why neurology matters\n\n- **High prevalence**: Neurological disorders affect millions worldwide and are a leading cause of disability.  \n- **Complexity**: The nervous system’s intricate structure and function require specialized knowledge.  \n- **Rapid advances**: New imaging, genetics, and therapeutics (e.g., gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy) are transforming care.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nNeurology is the medical specialty that studies the nervous system and treats its diseases. Neurologists diagnose and manage conditions ranging from headaches and seizures to stroke, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis, using a combination of clinical skills, advanced imaging, and electrophysiological tests."

        "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It flows outward through the entire solar system at speeds ranging from about 300 km s⁻¹ (slow wind) to over 800 km s⁻¹ (fast wind).  \n\n### Key points\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Composition** | ~95 % protons (hydrogen nuclei), ~4 % electrons, ~1 % alpha particles (helium nuclei) and trace heavier ions. |\n| **Origin** | The Sun’s hot, ionized corona (≈ 1–3 million K). Thermal pressure and magnetic forces accelerate the plasma outward. |\n| **Speed** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ (≈ 1–2 % of the speed of light). |\n| **Density** | At Earth’s orbit (~1 AU) ≈ 5–10 particles cm⁻³. |\n| **Magnetic field** | Carries the Sun’s magnetic field into space (the interplanetary magnetic field). |\n| **Effects** | • Shapes planetary magnetospheres (e.g., auroras). <br>• Drives space weather (geomagnetic storms, satellite drag). <br>• Interacts with the heliosphere, creating the heliopause where it meets the interstellar medium. |\n\n### How it’s detected\n\n- **Spacecraft** (e.g., ACE, WIND, Parker Solar Probe) measure particle flux, velocity, and magnetic field.  \n- **Ground‑based** magnetometers sense geomagnetic disturbances caused by solar‑wind pressure on Earth’s magnetosphere.  \n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Space weather**: Solar‑wind variations can disrupt communications, GPS, and power grids.  \n- **Planetary science**: Helps us understand how the Sun’s activity influences planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres.  \n- **Heliospheric physics**: Provides a laboratory for studying plasma physics, shock waves, and magnetic reconnection.  \n\nIn short, solar wind is the Sun’s “solar breeze” of ionized particles that permeates the solar system, shaping planetary environments and driving space‑weather phenomena."

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar cells** (also called **photovoltaic cells**) are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. They do this by using the **photovoltaic effect**—when photons from the sun hit a semiconductor material, they knock electrons loose, creating a flow of electric current.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How a solar cell works\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Photon absorption** | Light photons hit the semiconductor (usually silicon). |\n| **Electron excitation** | Photons give enough energy to free electrons from their atoms, creating electron‑hole pairs. |\n| **Charge separation** | A built‑in electric field (created by doping the semiconductor with different elements) pushes electrons toward one side and holes toward the other. |\n| **Current flow** | When the cell is connected to an external circuit, electrons flow from the negative side to the positive side, generating a current. |\n| **Voltage** | The built‑in field also creates a voltage (typically ~0.5–0.6 V per cell). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core components\n\n| Component | Function |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Semiconductor wafer** | Usually crystalline silicon (monocrystalline or polycrystalline) or thin‑film materials (CdTe, CIGS, perovskite). |\n| **Anti‑reflection coating** | Reduces reflection, letting more light enter. |\n| **Transparent conductive layer** | Allows light in while collecting electrons (often ITO or doped silicon). |\n| **Back contact** | Collects holes and completes the circuit. |\n| **Encapsulation** | Protects the cell from moisture, UV, and mechanical damage (often EVA or polycarbonate). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types of solar cells\n\n| Type | Key features |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon** | Single‑crystal wafer, high efficiency (~20–25 %), uniform color. |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon** | Multi‑crystal wafer, slightly lower efficiency (~15–18 %), cheaper. |\n| **Thin‑film** | Very thin layers of semiconductor on a substrate (glass, plastic). Lower cost, flexible, but lower efficiency (~10–12 %). |\n| **Perovskite** | Emerging technology, high efficiency (~25 % in lab), potentially low‑cost, but stability issues remain. |\n| **Multi‑junction** | Stacked cells with different bandgaps, used in space and high‑performance applications (efficiency > 40 %). |\n\n---\n\n## 4. From cell to system\n\n1. **Modules** – Several cells wired in series/parallel to produce a usable voltage and current.  \n2. **Inverters** – Convert the DC output of modules into AC for home or grid use.  \n3. **Mounting & tracking** – Panels are fixed or tracked to follow the sun, maximizing energy capture.  \n4. **Storage** – Batteries or other storage systems can hold excess energy for use when the sun isn’t shining.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Why they matter\n\n- **Renewable energy**: Solar cells provide clean, abundant electricity with no greenhouse‑gas emissions during operation.  \n- **Scalability**: From small rooftop panels to large utility‑scale solar farms.  \n- **Energy independence**: Reduces reliance on fossil fuels and enhances grid resilience.  \n- **Innovation**: Ongoing research aims to lower costs, improve efficiency, and develop flexible or building‑integrated photovoltaics.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA solar cell is a semiconductor device that turns photons from sunlight into electrical current through the photovoltaic effect. By combining many cells into modules and integrating them with inverters and storage, we can harness the sun’s energy to power homes, businesses, and even entire communities."

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Semiconductors** are materials that conduct electricity better than insulators but not as well as conductors. Their electrical conductivity can be precisely controlled by adding impurities (doping) or by changing temperature, light, or electric fields. This tunability makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | Semiconductors have a small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can be excited across this gap with modest energy, allowing current to flow. |\n| **Doping** | Adding a few atoms of a different element (e.g., phosphorus or boron in silicon) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type). This controls the number and type of charge carriers. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | A regular lattice (e.g., diamond‑like for silicon) provides a predictable electronic band structure. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Integrated circuits, solar cells, power devices | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑frequency RF, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 2.3–3.3 |\n| **Gallium nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power switches, RF | 3.4 |\n| **Perovskite (e.g., MAPbI₃)** | Emerging solar cells | ~1.5 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction: allows current in one direction. |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Uses p‑n junctions or field‑effect to amplify or switch current. |\n| **Integrated circuit (IC)** | Millions of transistors on a single silicon chip. |\n| **Photodiode / Solar cell** | Light excites electrons across the band gap, generating current. |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting photons. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why semiconductors are essential\n\n- **Miniaturization**: Tiny transistors can be packed into billions per chip, enabling smartphones, computers, and IoT devices.  \n- **Energy efficiency**: Low power consumption compared to mechanical or vacuum‑tube devices.  \n- **Versatility**: Can be engineered for specific functions—high‑speed logic, low‑power sensors, high‑power power electronics, optoelectronics, etc.  \n- **Innovation driver**: Advances in semiconductor technology (Moore’s Law, 5 nm nodes, silicon photonics) continue to push computing, communications, and energy solutions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **First semiconductor device** | 1904: German physicist Ferdinand Braun’s “photoconductor” (silicon carbide). |\n| **First transistor** | 1947: Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at Bell Labs (silicon‑germanium). |\n| **Silicon dominance** | ~90 % of integrated circuits use silicon. |\n| **Global market** | 2023 semiconductor revenue ≈ $400 billion, with a projected CAGR of ~8 % through 2030. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity lies between conductors and insulators, and whose properties can be finely tuned by doping and external stimuli. This controllability makes them indispensable for transistors, integrated circuits, solar cells, LEDs, and countless other electronic devices that power modern life."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called **hyphae**. When these hyphae branch and spread, they form a visible, often fuzzy or powdery, colony that can be green, black, white, or many other colors.\n\n### How mold grows\n| Factor | Effect on mold growth |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| **Moisture** | Essential; most molds need > 60 % relative humidity or a wet surface. |\n| **Temperature** | 10 – 30 °C (50 – 86 °F) is ideal for many species; some can grow at lower or higher temps. |\n| **Nutrients** | Organic matter (paper, wood, food, carpet, drywall) provides carbon and nitrogen. |\n| **Airflow** | Poor ventilation encourages mold; good airflow can limit growth. |\n\n### Common types\n- **Aspergillus** – often found on food, dust, and indoor surfaces.  \n- **Cladosporium** – common in damp indoor environments.  \n- **Stachybotrys chartarum** (black mold) – associated with water damage and can produce mycotoxins.  \n- **Penicillium** – often seen on moldy food and in damp buildings.  \n\n### Why it matters\n- **Health**: Inhalation of mold spores or mycotoxins can cause allergic reactions, asthma exacerbations, sinus infections, and in rare cases, more severe respiratory or systemic illnesses.  \n- **Structural damage**: Mold can degrade building materials (wood, drywall, insulation), leading to costly repairs.  \n- **Odor**: Mold often produces a musty, earthy smell.  \n\n### Prevention & control\n1. **Control moisture** – fix leaks, use dehumidifiers, keep indoor humidity < 50 %.  \n2. **Ventilation** – ensure proper airflow in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements.  \n3. **Clean promptly** – wipe up water spills and dry wet surfaces within 24 hours.  \n4. **Remove mold** – small colonies can be cleaned with detergent or diluted bleach; larger infestations may require professional remediation.  \n\n### Quick takeaway\nMold is a fungus that thrives on moisture and organic material, forming visible colonies that can damage structures and affect health. Keeping indoor environments dry and well‑ventilated is the best way to prevent mold growth."

        "**Desktop publishing (DTP)** is the process of creating printed or digital documents—such as books, magazines, brochures, newsletters, flyers, posters, and even web pages—using a personal computer, specialized software, and high‑quality output devices. It combines the functions of a word processor, a layout engine, and a graphics editor into one workflow, allowing designers and writers to produce professional‑looking materials without the need for a full‑time typesetting or printing studio.\n\n---\n\n### Core components\n\n| Component | What it does |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| **Computer** | The central workstation (Windows, macOS, Linux). |\n| **DTP software** | Programs like Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, Microsoft Publisher, Scribus, or Affinity Publisher that provide layout, typography, and image handling. |\n| **Fonts & typefaces** | Digital typefaces (TrueType, OpenType) that can be scaled and styled. |\n| **Images & graphics** | Raster (JPEG, PNG) and vector (SVG, AI, EPS) files that can be resized without loss. |\n| **Output devices** | Printers (laser, inkjet, large‑format), PDF generators, and sometimes direct‑to‑press workflows. |\n\n---\n\n### Typical workflow\n\n1. **Planning & content creation**  \n   - Outline the document, write text, gather images, and decide on a layout structure.  \n2. **Layout design**  \n   - Set up master pages (headers, footers, page numbers).  \n   - Place text frames, image frames, and apply styles (paragraph, character).  \n3. **Typography & styling**  \n   - Choose fonts, set point sizes, line spacing, and kerning.  \n   - Apply color schemes and design elements.  \n4. **Proofing & revisions**  \n   - Review for typographical errors, alignment issues, and image resolution.  \n   - Use “preflight” tools to check for missing fonts, low‑resolution images, or color‑mode mismatches.  \n5. **Export & output**  \n   - Generate PDFs (print‑ready or web‑ready).  \n   - Send files to a press or print service, or publish online.  \n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Benefit | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Cost‑effective** | Eliminates the need for expensive typesetting or layout studios. |\n| **Speed** | Designers can iterate quickly, making changes in real time. |\n| **Control** | Full creative freedom over typography, color, and layout. |\n| **Versatility** | Works for print, digital, and even interactive media (e‑books, PDFs). |\n| **Accessibility** | Many free or low‑cost DTP tools (e.g., Scribus, Canva) make publishing accessible to small businesses and individuals. |\n\n---\n\n### Common uses\n\n- **Print media**: Books, magazines, newsletters, flyers, posters, business cards.  \n- **Digital media**: PDFs, e‑books, interactive PDFs, web graphics.  \n- **Marketing collateral**: Brochures, catalogs, product sheets.  \n- **Educational materials**: Worksheets, handouts, lesson plans.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick summary\n\nDesktop publishing is the art and technology of producing high‑quality printed or digital documents on a personal computer using specialized layout software. It brings professional design capabilities—typography, image handling, page layout—into the hands of individuals and small teams, enabling rapid, cost‑effective creation of a wide range of media."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal, degenerative brain disorder that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion**.  \n\n### How it works\n- The prion protein (normally harmless) folds into a malformed shape that can induce other normal prion proteins to misfold.  \n- These misfolded proteins accumulate in the brain, forming sponge‑like holes (hence “spongiform”) and destroying brain tissue.  \n- The disease progresses slowly, with symptoms appearing months to years after infection.\n\n### Transmission\n- **In cattle**: Primarily through feed contaminated with infected animal parts (the “feed‑borne” route).  \n- **To humans**: Through consumption of infected beef products, leading to **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**, a rare but invariably fatal neurological disorder.\n\n### Key facts\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **First identified** | 1986 in the United Kingdom. |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Loss of coordination, weight loss, abnormal behavior, tremors, and eventually death. |\n| **Incidence** | Declined sharply after strict feed‑ban regulations and surveillance; now very rare in most countries. |\n| **Human risk** | Extremely low in countries with strict controls; vCJD cases are rare (tens of cases worldwide since the 1990s). |\n| **Prevention** | Bans on feeding cattle with animal protein, rigorous testing of cattle, and removal of high‑risk tissues (brain, spinal cord). |\n\n### Bottom line\nMad cow disease is a prion‑based neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can, in rare cases, be transmitted to humans through contaminated beef, causing a fatal neurological illness. It is largely controlled today through feed regulations and surveillance."

They work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently than it would otherwise.  \n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Structure** | Mostly proteins composed of amino‑acid chains that fold into a specific 3‑D shape. Some enzymes are ribozymes (RNA catalysts). |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one particular substrate (or a small group of related substrates) and converts it into a specific product. |\n| **Catalytic cycle** | Enzymes bind the substrate at their active site, form a temporary enzyme‑substrate complex, and then release the product, ready to bind another substrate molecule. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by factors such as temperature, pH, inhibitors, activators, and allosteric effectors. |\n| **Role in metabolism** | Enzymes drive virtually all metabolic pathways—digestion, energy production, DNA replication, signal transduction, etc. |\n| **Kinetics** | Their activity follows Michaelis‑Menten kinetics, characterized by parameters like \\(K_m\\) (substrate affinity) and \\(V_{\\max}\\) (maximum rate). |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the workhorses of biochemistry, enabling the complex chemistry of life to occur at the speeds and conditions required for organisms to survive."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Why it’s *yellow* | What’s really happening |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | The Sun actually emits almost *white* light (a mix of all visible wavelengths). As that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering). The longer‑wavelength yellow‑red photons reach our eyes more directly, so the Sun appears yellow. |\n| **Human eye sensitivity** | Our eyes are most sensitive to green‑yellow light. Even when the Sun is white, the human visual system tends to interpret the dominant wavelengths as “yellow.” |\n| **Altitude effect** | At sunrise or sunset, the Sun’s light passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving a reddish‑orange hue. At noon, when the Sun is high, less scattering occurs, so the Sun looks more “white‑yellow.” |\n| **Instrumental & cultural factors** | Many early drawings and photographs used yellow or orange pigments to represent the Sun, reinforcing the perception. Modern high‑resolution imaging shows the Sun’s spectrum is essentially white, with a slight yellowish tint due to the Sun’s surface temperature (~5,800 K). |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun is not truly yellow; it emits white light. The yellow appearance is a result of atmospheric scattering and the way our eyes perceive the remaining wavelengths."

It is caused by a member of the *Picornaviridae* family, the *Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease Virus* (FMDV).  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (often 1–3 days before lesions appear) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that break to form ulcers on the mouth, tongue, and inside the lips (hence “mouth”) <br>• Similar lesions on the feet, hooves, and teats (hence “foot”) <br>• Lameness, reduced appetite, and decreased milk production. <br>• In young animals, the disease can be more severe and may lead to death. |\n| **Impact** | • **Economic**: Losses from decreased productivity, trade restrictions, and control costs (culling, vaccination, movement bans). <br>• **Public health**: The virus is not transmissible to humans, but it can contaminate food products (meat, milk, dairy). |\n| **Control & Prevention** | • **Vaccination**: In endemic regions, regular vaccination programs are used. <br>• **Movement restrictions**: Quarantine and movement bans for infected or exposed herds. <br>• **Biosecurity**: Strict hygiene, disinfection, and controlled access to farms. <br>• **Surveillance**: Rapid detection and reporting to authorities. |\n| **Global status** | FMD is a notifiable disease under the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Many countries maintain strict control or eradication programs; outbreaks can lead to international trade bans. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of livestock, leading to significant economic losses and requiring stringent control measures."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in air, in some cases).  \n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission** – A sonar system emits a sound pulse (a “ping”) into the medium (water, air, etc.).  \n2. **Propagation** – The pulse travels outward at the speed of sound (≈ 1,500 m/s in seawater).  \n3. **Reflection** – When the pulse hits an object, part of the sound is reflected back toward the source.  \n4. **Reception** – Hydrophones (underwater microphones) or microphones pick up the echo.  \n5. **Processing** – The system measures the time delay between emission and reception, and sometimes the frequency shift (Doppler effect), to calculate distance, speed, and sometimes shape or material properties of the target.\n\n### Common Uses\n- **Navigation** – Avoiding obstacles, mapping the seafloor, and guiding ships or submarines.  \n- **Search & Rescue** – Locating submerged objects or people.  \n- **Fishing** – Detecting fish schools.  \n- **Military** – Detecting submarines, torpedoes, and underwater mines.  \n- **Scientific** – Bathymetric mapping, studying marine life, and monitoring oceanographic conditions.\n\n### Types\n- **Active sonar** – Emits a pulse and listens for echoes (most common).  \n- **Passive sonar** – Only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships).  \n- **Side‑scan sonar** – Produces detailed images of the seafloor by scanning sideways.  \n- **Multibeam sonar** – Emits multiple beams to create high‑resolution 3‑D maps.\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where light cannot reach."

It’s not a single disease but a syndrome—meaning it’s a collection of symptoms that tend to occur together.  \n\n| What it looks like | What it feels like | Why it matters |\n|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Widespread pain** – aching in muscles, tendons, and soft tissues, often described as a “deep ache” or “burning” that can affect the whole body. | **Tender points** – specific spots (e.g., neck, shoulders, hips, knees) that hurt when pressed. | The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, work, and sleep. |\n| **Fatigue** – feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. | **Sleep disturbances** – many people have “fibro‑sleep” (sleep that’s not restorative). | Chronic fatigue can lead to mood changes, depression, and anxiety. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** – trouble concentrating, memory lapses, “brain fog.” | **Headaches** – tension‑type or migraines. | Cognitive symptoms can affect job performance and relationships. |\n| **Other symptoms** – irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, numbness, tingling, and sensitivity to temperature or noise. | **Mood swings** – anxiety, depression, irritability. | The combination of physical and mental symptoms can reduce quality of life. |\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n- **Genetics** – family history increases risk.  \n- **Stress** – physical or emotional stress can trigger or worsen symptoms.  \n- **Infections** – some people develop fibromyalgia after a viral or bacterial infection.  \n- **Trauma** – physical injury or emotional trauma can be a trigger.  \n- **Sleep problems** – poor sleep quality can exacerbate pain and fatigue.\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Physical exam** – doctor checks for tender points (traditionally 18 specific spots).  \n- **Rule out other conditions** – blood tests, imaging, or other labs to exclude arthritis, thyroid disease, etc.  \n- **Criteria** – the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a combination of pain severity, tender point count, and symptom duration.\n\n### Treatment\nThere’s no “cure,” but many people find relief with a combination of:\n\n| Approach | What it does |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Medications** | Pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin). |\n| **Exercise** | Low‑impact aerobic activity (walking, swimming, cycling) and stretching. |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening, posture training, and pain‑management techniques. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps manage pain perception, stress, and coping strategies. |\n| **Sleep hygiene** | Consistent bedtime routine, avoiding stimulants, and sometimes sleep‑medication. |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Balanced diet, stress‑reduction (yoga, meditation), and avoiding alcohol or caffeine. |\n| **Alternative therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, biofeedback, and certain supplements (e.g., magnesium, vitamin D). |\n\n### Living with Fibromyalgia\n- **Track symptoms** – a diary can help identify triggers and patterns.  \n- **Set realistic goals** – break tasks into smaller steps to avoid overexertion.  \n- **Seek support** – support groups, counseling, or online communities can provide emotional help.  \n- **Educate others** – explaining the condition to friends, family, and coworkers can reduce misunderstandings.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Fibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition that primarily causes widespread pain and fatigue. While it can be challenging to manage, a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and therapy often helps people lead active, fulfilling lives."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Legally blind** (or “visually impaired”) is a legal classification used in the U.S. (and many other countries) to determine eligibility for disability benefits, transportation accommodations, and other services.  The definition is based on two main measures of vision:\n\n| Criterion | What it means | Typical threshold |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | Sharpness of vision in the better‑seeing eye, even after correction (glasses or contact lenses). | **20/200 or worse** (i.e., you see at 20 ft what a person with normal vision sees at 200 ft). |\n| **Visual field** | The area you can see without moving your eyes. | **A field of less than 20°** (i.e., you can’t see more than a 20‑degree cone of vision). |\n\n### How it’s applied\n1. **Best‑corrected acuity** is measured first.  \n   - If the better eye is 20/200 or worse, the person is legally blind regardless of field.  \n2. If acuity is better than 20/200, the visual field is checked.  \n   - If the field is 20° or less, the person is legally blind.  \n3. If neither criterion is met, the person is considered “visually impaired” but not legally blind.\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Disability benefits** (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicare/Medicaid).  \n- **Transportation** (e.g., free or discounted bus/rail passes, special driving accommodations).  \n- **Employment** (e.g., accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act).  \n- **Education** (e.g., special education services, assistive technology).  \n\n### Notes\n- The exact numbers can vary slightly by country or state, but the 20/200 acuity and 20° field are the most widely used U.S. standards.  \n- “Legal blindness” does **not** mean total blindness; many people who are legally blind can still see shapes, colors, and some detail.  \n\nSo, in short: a person is legally blind if their best‑corrected visual acuity is 20/200 or worse, or if their visual field is 20° or less."

The term is most often used for two common types:\n\n| Type | Where it occurs | Typical cause | Key symptoms |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic ulcer** | Stomach lining or first part of the small intestine (duodenum) | • Infection with *Helicobacter pylori* <br>• Chronic use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) <br>• Excess stomach acid | Burning abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, sometimes vomiting blood |\n| **Pressure ulcer (bed sore)** | Skin over bony areas (e.g., heels, sacrum) | • Prolonged pressure, friction, moisture | Redness that turns into a sore, possible drainage, pain when pressure is removed |\n\n### How an ulcer forms\n1. **Damage to the protective layer** (mucosa or skin) – e.g., acid erosion, pressure, infection.  \n2. **Loss of tissue integrity** – the underlying tissue is exposed.  \n3. **Inadequate healing** – due to ongoing irritation, poor blood supply, or infection.  \n4. **Chronic open wound** – the ulcer persists and may deepen.\n\n### Common risk factors\n- **For peptic ulcers:** H. pylori infection, NSAID use, smoking, alcohol, stress.  \n- **For pressure ulcers:** Immobility, incontinence, poor nutrition, reduced sensation (e.g., neuropathy).\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Peptic ulcer:** Endoscopy, breath test for H. pylori, blood/urine tests.  \n- **Pressure ulcer:** Visual inspection, wound assessment scales (e.g., Braden Scale).\n\n### Treatment\n| Goal | Typical approach |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Stop the cause** | • Stop NSAIDs, use proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H₂ blockers. <br>• Treat H. pylori with antibiotics. <br>• Relieve pressure (special mattresses, repositioning). |\n| **Promote healing** | • Acid suppression therapy. <br>• Wound care (cleaning, dressings, debridement). |\n| **Prevent complications** | • Monitor for bleeding, perforation (peptic). <br>• Prevent infection, maintain nutrition. |\n\n### Prognosis\n- **Peptic ulcers** are usually curable with medication and lifestyle changes; recurrence is common if risk factors persist.  \n- **Pressure ulcers** can heal if pressure is relieved early, but advanced stages may require surgical debridement or grafting.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** An ulcer is an open sore that fails to heal because of ongoing damage or inadequate blood supply. The most common types are peptic ulcers in the digestive tract and pressure ulcers on the skin. Treatment focuses on removing the underlying cause, protecting the wound, and supporting the body’s healing processes."

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money you invest or borrow (the *principal*), but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Example |\n|------|--------------|---------|\n| **1. Start with a principal** | The initial amount of money. | $1,000 |\n| **2. Apply an interest rate** | The bank or lender adds a percentage of the current balance. | 5 % per year → $50 interest after the first year. |\n| **3. Add the interest to the principal** | The new balance becomes the base for the next period. | $1,000 + $50 = $1,050 |\n| **4. Repeat** | Each subsequent period the interest is calculated on the *new* balance. | Next year: 5 % of $1,050 = $52.50 → new balance $1,102.50 |\n\nBecause the interest is added to the principal, the amount on which you earn interest grows each period, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\n---\n\n## Key terms\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **Principal** | Original amount of money. |\n| **Rate** | The percentage at which interest is calculated (often expressed as an annual percentage rate, APR). |\n| **Period** | The time interval over which interest is calculated (year, month, day, etc.). |\n| **Compounding frequency** | How often the interest is added to the principal (annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, continuously). |\n| **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)** | The true yearly rate after accounting for compounding. |\n| **Continuous compounding** | Interest is added an infinite number of times per year, described mathematically by the exponential function \\(e^{rt}\\). |\n\n---\n\n## Formula\n\nFor a principal \\(P\\), annual interest rate \\(r\\) (as a decimal), compounding \\(n\\) times per year, and \\(t\\) years:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = amount after \\(t\\) years (principal + interest).  \n- If compounding is **continuous**, use:\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Why it matters\n\n| Scenario | Compound interest advantage |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| **Savings** | Your money grows faster than simple interest, especially over long periods. |\n| **Loans** | You pay more interest over time if the loan compounds, so it’s important to understand the compounding schedule. |\n| **Investments** | Mutual funds, bonds, and other vehicles often compound daily or monthly, boosting returns. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick example\n\nSuppose you invest $5,000 at 6 % per year, compounded quarterly, for 10 years.\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 10}\n  = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.015\\right)^{40}\n  \\approx 5000 \\times 1.8194\n  \\approx \\$9,097\n\\]\n\nYou’d end up with about **$9,097**—nearly double the original amount—thanks to compounding.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nCompound interest is the “interest on interest” that lets your money (or debt) grow faster over time. The more frequently it compounds, the greater the effect. Understanding the compounding frequency and rate is essential for making smart financial decisions."

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why we need hybridization\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have specific shapes and energies.  \n- In many molecules, the bonds we observe (e.g., the straight line of a C–C single bond or the 120° angles in methane) don’t match the shapes of the pure s or p orbitals.  \n- Hybridization provides a way to combine orbitals so that the resulting orbitals have the right shape and energy to form the observed bonds.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How it works\n\n| Step | What happens | Resulting hybrid orbitals |\n|------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **1. Identify the central atom** | Determine how many bonds (and lone pairs) it forms. | Count the “electron domains.” |\n| **2. Choose the appropriate hybridization** | Based on the number of domains: |\n| | 2 domains → **sp** |\n| | 3 domains → **sp²** |\n| | 4 domains → **sp³** |\n| | 5 domains → **sp³d** |\n| | 6 domains → **sp³d²** |\n| **3. Mix orbitals** | Combine one s orbital with the appropriate number of p (and d, if needed) orbitals. |\n| **4. Form hybrid orbitals** | The new orbitals are equivalent in energy and oriented in space to match the molecular geometry. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common examples\n\n| Molecule | Domains | Hybridization | Geometry | Hybrid orbitals |\n|----------|---------|---------------|----------|-----------------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | 4 sp³ orbitals |\n| **Ethene (C₂H₄)** | 3 per C | sp² | Trigonal planar (120°) | 3 sp² + 1 p |\n| **Acetylene (C₂H₂)** | 2 per C | sp | Linear (180°) | 2 sp + 2 p |\n| **BF₃** | 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 3 sp² |\n| **PCl₅** | 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 5 sp³d |\n| **SF₆** | 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 6 sp³d² |\n\n---\n\n## 4. What the hybrid orbitals look like\n\n- **sp**: One s + one p → two linear orbitals 180° apart.  \n- **sp²**: One s + two p → three orbitals 120° apart (planar).  \n- **sp³**: One s + three p → four orbitals 109.5° apart (tetrahedral).  \n- **sp³d**: One s + three p + one d → five orbitals (trigonal bipyramidal).  \n- **sp³d²**: One s + three p + two d → six orbitals (octahedral).\n\nThese hybrid orbitals are **spatially oriented** to minimize electron‑electron repulsion, giving the molecule its observed shape.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why it matters\n\n- **Predicts bond angles**: The hybridization tells you the ideal angles (e.g., 109.5°, 120°, 180°).  \n- **Explains bond strengths**: Hybrid orbitals that mix s and p character are more tightly held to the nucleus, making bonds stronger.  \n- **Helps in molecular orbital theory**: Hybridization is a stepping‑stone to more advanced concepts like resonance and delocalization.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is the mixing of atomic orbitals (s, p, d) to produce new, equivalent orbitals that match the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules. It explains why molecules have the shapes they do and provides a useful framework for predicting bond angles and reactivity."

      "system_answer": [
        "**How fast alcohol is absorbed**\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical time frame |\n|------|--------------|--------------------|\n| **Ingestion** | Alcohol enters the stomach and small intestine. | 0–5 min |\n| **Stomach absorption** | Roughly 10–20 % of the dose is absorbed here. | 5–15 min |\n| **Small‑intestine absorption** | The bulk (≈ 80–90 %) is absorbed into the bloodstream. | 15–30 min |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | Usually reached 30–90 min after drinking, depending on dose and individual factors. | 30–90 min |\n\n### Why the timing varies\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Food in the stomach** | Slows gastric emptying → delays absorption. |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑proof drinks (≥ 40 %) are absorbed more quickly than beer or wine. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Larger or more muscular individuals dilute alcohol more, so peak BAC is lower and may take longer to reach. |\n| **Gender** | Women generally have less body water and higher fat, so they reach higher BACs faster. |\n| **Metabolism** | Liver enzyme activity (alcohol dehydrogenase) varies; faster metabolism can lower peak BAC. |\n| **Drinking rate** | Rapid consumption (e.g., “chugging”) can overwhelm the stomach’s absorption capacity, leading to a higher peak. |\n| **Alcohol type** | Spirits → faster; beer/wine → slower. |\n| **Temperature** | Cold drinks may slow gastric emptying slightly. |\n\n### Typical absorption curves\n\n- **Beer (5 % ABV)**: Peak BAC ~0.04–0.06 % after 30–60 min.  \n- **Wine (12 % ABV)**: Peak BAC ~0.05–0.07 % after 45–75 min.  \n- **Spirits (40 % ABV)**: Peak BAC ~0.07–0.10 % after 30–60 min.\n\n### Key take‑aways\n\n1. **Most alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine**, not the stomach.  \n2. **Peak BAC occurs roughly 30–90 minutes after drinking**, depending on dose, food, and individual physiology.  \n3. **Food slows absorption**; drinking on an empty stomach leads to a faster, higher peak.  \n4. **Individual differences** (weight, gender, metabolism) can shift the timing and magnitude of BAC.\n\nSo, while the exact speed varies, you can expect the bulk of alcohol to be absorbed within the first half‑hour to an hour after you start drinking."

        "**Pediatricians** are medical doctors who specialize in the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents—generally from birth up to about 18 years old (sometimes extending into the early 20s for certain subspecialties).  \n\n| Key points |\n|------------|\n| **Scope of practice** – They diagnose and treat illnesses, injuries, and developmental problems in children, provide preventive care (vaccinations, growth monitoring), and counsel parents on nutrition, safety, and healthy habits. |\n| **Training** – After a 4‑year undergraduate degree, they complete a 4‑year medical school program, followed by a 3‑year residency in pediatrics. Many then pursue additional fellowships in subspecialties such as neonatology, pediatric cardiology, or pediatric oncology. |\n| **Specialties** – Pediatricians can focus on areas like: <br>• **Neonatology** (newborns, especially premature infants) <br>• **Pediatric cardiology** (heart conditions) <br>• **Pediatric oncology** (childhood cancers) <br>• **Pediatric neurology** (brain & nervous system) <br>• **Pediatric endocrinology** (hormonal disorders) <br>• **Pediatric infectious disease** (viruses, bacteria) <br>• **Pediatric gastroenterology** (digestive system) <br>• **Pediatric psychiatry** (mental health) <br>• **Pediatric emergency medicine** (urgent care) |\n| **Why they’re important** – Children have unique physiological and developmental needs that differ from adults. Pediatricians are trained to address these differences, ensuring early detection of health issues and promoting healthy growth and development. |\n| **Common tasks** – Physical exams, growth charts, developmental screenings, immunizations, management of chronic conditions (asthma, diabetes), counseling on nutrition and safety, and coordination with specialists when needed. |\n\nIn short, a pediatrician is a doctor who focuses on the medical care of children, from newborns through adolescence, ensuring they grow up healthy and strong."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Strep throat** is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A streptococcus). It’s one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adults.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What happens in strep throat?\n\n| Step | What occurs |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Bacterial invasion** | The bacteria colonize the tonsils and pharynx. |\n| **Immune response** | The body releases white blood cells and inflammatory mediators, leading to redness, swelling, and pain. |\n| **Symptoms** | Sudden, severe sore throat; fever; swollen lymph nodes; white or yellow patches on tonsils; headache; nausea; and sometimes a rash. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How is it diagnosed?\n\n| Method | What it looks for |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Rapid antigen test** | Detects streptococcal antigens in a throat swab (results in minutes). |\n| **Throat culture** | Grows bacteria on agar plates; confirms diagnosis and checks antibiotic sensitivity (takes 24–48 h). |\n| **Clinical criteria** | Fever, tonsillar exudates, tender cervical lymph nodes, absence of cough. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why it matters\n\n- **Complications** if untreated: rheumatic fever, post‑streptococcal glomerulonephritis, peritonsillar abscess, and, rarely, scarlet fever.  \n- **Transmission**: via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Treatment | How it works |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| **Antibiotics** (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) | Kill the bacteria, shorten illness, prevent complications, and reduce contagiousness. |\n| **Symptom relief** | Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain; saline gargles; throat lozenges. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Essential for recovery. |\n\n- **Duration**: 10 days of antibiotics; contagious for about 24 h after starting treatment (or 7 days if untreated).  \n- **When to seek care**: high fever, difficulty swallowing, rash, or if symptoms last > 48 h.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n- **Hand hygiene**: Wash hands frequently, especially after coughing or sneezing.  \n- **Avoid close contact** with infected individuals.  \n- **Cover coughs/sneezes** with a tissue or elbow.  \n- **Keep surfaces clean** (especially in schools and daycare).  \n- **Vaccines**: No vaccine for strep throat; prevention relies on hygiene and early treatment.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Incidence** | ~10–30 % of sore throats in children, 5–10 % in adults. |\n| **Peak age** | 5–15 years old. |\n| **Seasonality** | More common in winter and early spring. |\n| **Misdiagnosis** | Viral sore throats (e.g., cold, flu) are far more common; antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial infection that causes a sudden, painful sore throat and fever. It’s diagnosed with a rapid test or culture and treated with antibiotics to prevent complications and reduce contagiousness. Good hygiene and early medical care are key to managing and preventing it."

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Poliomyelitis (polio)** is a highly infectious viral disease that attacks the nervous system, most often the motor neurons that control muscle movement. The virus is spread through the fecal‑oral route (contaminated food or water) and, less commonly, by direct contact with an infected person.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the virus works\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Entry** | The poliovirus enters the body via the mouth, usually through contaminated food or water. |\n| **Replication** | It first replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa. |\n| **Viremia** | The virus then spreads through the bloodstream to various organs, including the spinal cord and brain. |\n| **Neurotropism** | In susceptible individuals, the virus infects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. |\n| **Cell death** | Infected neurons die, leading to loss of muscle control. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clinical presentation\n\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (can be 3–30 days). Usually asymptomatic. |\n| **Early symptoms** | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. |\n| **Paralytic polio** (rare, ~1 % of infections) | Sudden onset of muscle weakness or paralysis, often starting in the legs and progressing upward. |\n| **Non‑paralytic polio** | Mild flu‑like illness; no paralysis. |\n| **Post‑polio syndrome** | Years after recovery, some patients experience new weakness, fatigue, and pain. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Virus isolation** (cell culture) | Detects poliovirus in stool or throat swabs. |\n| **Serology** | Detects antibodies (IgM) against poliovirus. |\n| **PCR** | Detects viral RNA in stool or CSF. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n- **Supportive care**: Hydration, pain control, respiratory support if paralysis involves breathing muscles.  \n- **Physical therapy**: Helps maintain muscle strength and prevent contractures.  \n- **No antiviral**: There is no specific cure; treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n| Method | How it works |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). IPV is used in the U.S.; OPV is used in many other countries. |\n| **Hygiene** | Handwashing, safe drinking water, proper sanitation. |\n| **Surveillance** | Monitoring for cases to quickly identify and contain outbreaks. |\n\n- **Global eradication**: Since the 1980s, polio has been eliminated in most of the world. The last naturally occurring case of wild poliovirus was in 2014 (in Afghanistan). However, vaccine‑derived strains can still circulate in under‑immunized populations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Transmission** | Fecal‑oral; contaminated food/water; close contact. |\n| **Incidence** | < 1 % of infections cause paralysis; < 0.1 % lead to death. |\n| **Age group** | Children under 5 are most vulnerable. |\n| **Global status** | Polio is close to eradication; only a few countries still report wild poliovirus. |\n| **Historical impact** | Before vaccines, polio caused widespread paralysis and disability worldwide. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPoliomyelitis is a viral infection that can cause paralysis by destroying motor neurons. It is preventable with vaccination and good hygiene, and global efforts have nearly eliminated the disease."

        "**Neurology** is the branch of medicine that focuses on the nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves—and the disorders that affect them. It is both a clinical specialty (diagnosing and treating patients) and a research field (studying how the nervous system works and how it goes wrong).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What does a neurologist do?\n\n| Area | What it involves |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Diagnosis** | Uses history, physical exam, and tests (EEG, EMG, MRI, CT, lumbar puncture, nerve conduction studies) to identify conditions. |\n| **Treatment** | Prescribes medications, performs procedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, spinal cord stimulation), and coordinates care with other specialists. |\n| **Management** | Provides long‑term care for chronic neurological diseases (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis). |\n| **Research** | Investigates mechanisms of disease, develops new therapies, and tests clinical trials. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key neurological disorders\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Cerebrovascular** | Stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation. |\n| **Neurodegenerative** | Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease. |\n| **Epilepsy & seizures** | Focal seizures, generalized seizures, status epilepticus. |\n| **Movement disorders** | Parkinson’s, essential tremor, dystonia. |\n| **Peripheral neuropathies** | Diabetic neuropathy, Guillain‑Barré syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome. |\n| **Headache disorders** | Migraine, tension‑type headache, cluster headache. |\n| **Neuro‑oncology** | Brain tumors, spinal cord tumors. |\n| **Neuro‑immunology** | Multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis. |\n| **Neuro‑psychiatric** | Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia (often overlapping with psychiatry). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How neurology differs from other specialties\n\n| Specialty | Focus |\n|-----------|-------|\n| **Neurology** | Functional disorders of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerves). |\n| **Neurosurgery** | Surgical treatment of brain, spinal cord, and nerve disorders. |\n| **Psychiatry** | Mental health disorders, often with a neurochemical basis. |\n| **Neuro‑ophthalmology** | Eye disorders related to the nervous system. |\n| **Neuro‑critical care** | Intensive care for patients with severe neurological injury. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typical diagnostic tools\n\n| Tool | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** | Detailed images of brain and spinal cord structure. |\n| **CT (Computed Tomography)** | Quick imaging for acute hemorrhage or trauma. |\n| **EEG (Electroencephalogram)** | Measures electrical activity of the brain (seizures, encephalopathy). |\n| **EMG/NCS (Electromyography / Nerve Conduction Studies)** | Assesses nerve and muscle function. |\n| **Lumbar puncture** | Analyzes cerebrospinal fluid for infection, inflammation, or cancer. |\n| **PET scan** | Metabolic activity in the brain (e.g., Alzheimer’s). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why neurology matters\n\n- **High prevalence**: Neurological disorders affect millions worldwide (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, dementia).  \n- **Complexity**: The nervous system is the most intricate organ system, requiring specialized knowledge.  \n- **Rapid advances**: New imaging, genetics, and therapeutics are continually improving diagnosis and treatment.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nNeurology is the medical field that studies the nervous system and treats its diseases. Neurologists diagnose and manage a wide range of conditions—from headaches and seizures to stroke and neurodegenerative disorders—using a combination of clinical evaluation, advanced imaging, and specialized tests."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—mostly electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It flows outward through the entire solar system, carrying with it the Sun’s magnetic field and influencing planetary magnetospheres, space weather, and the interplanetary medium.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Where does it come from?\n\n| Layer | Key properties |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Photosphere** | Visible surface of the Sun; temperature ~5,800 K. |\n| **Chromosphere** | Layer above the photosphere; temperature rises to ~20,000 K. |\n| **Corona** | Outer atmosphere; temperatures reach 1–3 million K. |\n| **Solar wind source** | The hot, ionized corona expands outward because the thermal pressure exceeds the Sun’s gravitational pull. |\n\nThe corona’s high temperature gives particles enough kinetic energy to escape the Sun’s gravity, creating the solar wind.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What does it consist of?\n\n- **Protons (hydrogen nuclei)** – ~95 % of the mass.  \n- **Electrons** – ~4 % of the mass.  \n- **Alpha particles (helium nuclei)** – ~4 % of the mass.  \n- **Trace heavier ions** – e.g., oxygen, carbon, iron (very small fractions).  \n\nAll of these particles are ionized (charged), so they are guided by magnetic fields.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How fast is it?\n\n| Region | Typical speed |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Near the Sun (1 AU)** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ (≈ 1,000–2,800 mph). |\n| **Fast solar wind** | ~800–1,200 km s⁻¹ (originates from coronal holes). |\n| **Slow solar wind** | ~300–500 km s⁻¹ (originates from the streamer belt). |\n\nThe speed varies with solar activity, the Sun’s magnetic field, and the source region on the Sun.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why does it matter?\n\n| Effect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Space weather** | Solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere, causing geomagnetic storms, auroras, and disruptions to satellites, GPS, and power grids. |\n| **Heliosphere** | The solar wind creates the heliosphere—a bubble of solar plasma that shields the solar system from interstellar material. |\n| **Planetary atmospheres** | On Mars and other bodies without strong magnetic fields, the solar wind can erode atmospheres over geological time. |\n| **Cosmic ray modulation** | The solar wind’s magnetic field deflects high‑energy cosmic rays, affecting radiation levels in space. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. How is it measured?\n\n- **Spacecraft**: Missions like **Parker Solar Probe**, **Solar Orbiter**, and **ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer)** directly sample the wind’s particles, magnetic field, and plasma waves.  \n- **Ground‑based**: Radio telescopes observe interplanetary scintillation (fluctuations in radio signals caused by solar wind density irregularities).  \n- **Magnetometers**: Measure the interplanetary magnetic field carried by the wind.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick facts\n\n- **Mass loss**: The Sun loses about **1.4 × 10¹⁴ kg** per year via the solar wind (≈ 0.0001 % of its mass).  \n- **Energy**: The kinetic energy flux at Earth’s orbit is ~1 W m⁻².  \n- **Solar cycle**: Solar wind properties (speed, density, magnetic field) vary over the 11‑year solar cycle, peaking during solar maximum.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSolar wind is a hot, ionized plasma stream flowing from the Sun’s corona at hundreds of kilometers per second. It shapes the space environment around Earth and the entire solar system, driving auroras, influencing satellite operations, and protecting us from galactic cosmic rays."

They do this by using the **photovoltaic effect**—when photons from the sun hit a semiconductor material, they knock electrons loose, creating an electric current.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How a solar cell works\n\n| Step | What happens | Key component |\n|------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Photon absorption** | Sunlight (photons) strikes the cell. | Semiconductor (usually silicon). |\n| **Electron–hole pair creation** | Photons give electrons enough energy to leave their atoms, creating free electrons and “holes” (missing electrons). | p‑type and n‑type layers. |\n| **Separation of charge** | An internal electric field (built‑in junction) pushes electrons toward the n‑side and holes toward the p‑side. | p‑n junction. |\n| **Current flow** | When the cell is connected to a circuit, electrons flow from the n‑side to the p‑side, generating a current. | External load. |\n| **Voltage generation** | The built‑in electric field creates a voltage difference between the two sides. | p‑n junction. |\n\nThe combination of current (I) and voltage (V) gives the power output (P = I × V).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Types of solar cells\n\n| Type | Material | Typical efficiency | Common use |\n|------|----------|--------------------|------------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon** | Single‑crystal Si | 18–22 % | Residential rooftop panels, high‑performance applications |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon** | Multi‑crystal Si | 15–18 % | Utility‑scale farms, cost‑effective installations |\n| **Thin‑film (amorphous Si, CdTe, CIGS)** | Amorphous or compound semiconductors | 10–12 % (CdTe) / 12–14 % (CIGS) | Building‑integrated photovoltaics, flexible panels |\n| **Perovskite** | Lead‑based perovskite | 20–25 % (lab) | Emerging technology, tandem cells |\n| **Organic** | Conducting polymers | 5–10 % | Flexible, lightweight, low‑cost prototypes |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key performance metrics\n\n| Metric | What it means |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Efficiency** | % of incident solar power converted to electricity. |\n| **Fill factor (FF)** | Ratio of actual power to the product of open‑circuit voltage and short‑circuit current. |\n| **Voc (open‑circuit voltage)** | Maximum voltage when no current flows. |\n| **Isc (short‑circuit current)** | Current when the terminals are shorted. |\n| **Temperature coefficient** | How performance changes with temperature (usually negative). |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typical solar‑cell architecture\n\n```\n+-------------------+   (front contact, anti‑reflection coating)\n|  Transparent     |\n|  conductive layer|\n+-------------------+\n|  Anti‑reflection |\n|  coating          |\n+-------------------+\n|  p‑type silicon   |\n+-------------------+\n|  n‑type silicon   |\n+-------------------+\n|  Back contact     |\n+-------------------+\n```\n\n- **Front contact**: Usually a grid of metal (aluminum or silver) that collects electrons.  \n- **Back contact**: Often a thin metal layer that collects holes.  \n- **Anti‑reflection coating**: Reduces reflection losses.  \n- **Encapsulation**: Protects the cell from moisture and mechanical damage.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why solar cells matter\n\n| Benefit | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Renewable energy** | Sunlight is abundant and free. |\n| **Low operating cost** | No fuel, minimal maintenance. |\n| **Scalable** | From small rooftop panels to large utility‑scale farms. |\n| **Environmentally friendly** | No greenhouse‑gas emissions during operation. |\n| **Energy independence** | Reduces reliance on fossil fuels. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick facts\n\n- **Global installed capacity (2023)**: ~1 GW of solar PV.  \n- **Typical panel output**: 250–400 W per panel.  \n- **Lifespan**: 25–30 years with > 80 % of original capacity.  \n- **Cost trend**: Prices have fallen ~80 % over the last decade, making solar competitive with many conventional power sources.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSolar cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight into electricity via the photovoltaic effect. They are the fundamental building blocks of solar panels and are available in several material types, each with its own efficiency, cost, and application niche."

        "**Severance pay** is a financial payment that an employer gives to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually because the employee is laid off, the company is restructuring, or the employee is terminated for reasons other than misconduct. It is not a legal requirement in most places (except in some countries or under specific collective‑bargaining agreements), but many companies offer it as a goodwill gesture or to help the employee transition.\n\n### Key points\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Purpose** | • Provide a financial cushion while the employee searches for new work. <br>• Reduce the risk of litigation or negative publicity. <br>• Maintain morale and goodwill among remaining staff. |\n| **Typical form** | • Lump‑sum cash payment. <br>• Continued salary for a set period (e.g., 1–3 months). <br>• Combination of cash and benefits (e.g., extended health insurance). |\n| **Common calculation methods** | • **“One‑to‑two‑weeks’ pay per year of service”** (e.g., 1 week per year). <br>• **Fixed amount** (e.g., $5,000). <br>• **Percentage of final salary** (e.g., 10 %). |\n| **Conditions** | • May require the employee to sign a release of claims (waiver of future lawsuits). <br>• Often contingent on the employee not contesting the termination. |\n| **Tax treatment** | • In the U.S., severance pay is treated as ordinary income and is subject to withholding and payroll taxes. |\n| **Legal context** | • Not mandated by U.S. federal law (except in certain collective‑bargaining agreements). <br>• Some states or countries have specific rules (e.g., the UK’s statutory redundancy pay). |\n| **Common misconceptions** | • It is not the same as **unemployment benefits** (which are government‑funded). <br>• It is not a “bonus” or “reward”; it is a payment for the loss of employment. |\n\n### Example\n\nAn employee with 5 years of service might receive:\n\n- **Severance**: 1 week of pay per year × 5 years = 5 weeks of salary.  \n- **Health insurance**: 3 months of continued coverage.  \n- **Outplacement services**: Resume review, interview coaching, job‑search assistance.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSeverance pay is a voluntary or contractual payment from an employer to an employee when the employment ends, intended to ease the transition to new employment and to mitigate potential legal or reputational risks."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Semiconductors** are materials that conduct electricity better than insulators but not as well as conductors. Their electrical properties can be precisely controlled, which makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | The energy difference between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). In semiconductors, this gap is small (≈ 0.1–4 eV), so a modest amount of energy (heat, light, or an electric field) can excite electrons into the conduction band. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | As temperature rises, more electrons cross the band gap, increasing conductivity. This is opposite to metals, whose conductivity decreases with heat. |\n| **Doping ability** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (dopants) can create an excess of electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type), allowing precise control of charge carriers. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs) have a crystalline lattice that supports well‑defined electronic bands. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Microprocessors, memory chips, solar cells | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑speed electronics, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 2.3–3.3 |\n| **Gallium nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, RF amplifiers, power switches | 3.4 |\n| **Indium phosphide (InP)** | High‑frequency optoelectronics | 1.35 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction allows current to flow in one direction. |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Uses a small input signal to control a larger current; the key is the p‑n or gate‑oxide interface. |\n| **Integrated circuit (IC)** | Thousands to billions of transistors on a single silicon chip, enabling CPUs, GPUs, memory, sensors, etc. |\n| **Photovoltaic cell** | Absorbs photons, creates electron–hole pairs, drives current. |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting light. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why semiconductors are essential\n\n| Reason | Impact |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Miniaturization** | Allows billions of transistors on a chip the size of a fingernail. |\n| **Energy efficiency** | Low power consumption compared to vacuum tubes or mechanical relays. |\n| **Versatility** | Can be engineered for analog, digital, RF, optical, or power applications. |\n| **Scalability** | Manufacturing processes (photolithography, doping, etching) can be scaled to mass production. |\n| **Innovation driver** | Enables everything from smartphones to AI accelerators, electric‑vehicle power electronics, and renewable‑energy systems. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick facts\n\n- **Silicon dominates**: ~ 90 % of all integrated circuits use silicon.  \n- **Global market**: The semiconductor industry is worth over **$400 billion** annually.  \n- **Supply chain**: Production involves advanced fabs, clean rooms, and a global network of suppliers (wafer fabs, equipment, raw materials).  \n- **Future trends**: 3‑nm and 2‑nm process nodes, silicon‑on‑insulator (SOI), 2‑D materials (graphene, MoS₂), and quantum‑dot LEDs.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity lies between conductors and insulators, and whose properties can be finely tuned by doping and crystal engineering. This unique combination makes them indispensable for all modern electronic devices—from microchips in phones to solar panels and LED lighting."

It works by converting a physical change that occurs with temperature (such as expansion, electrical resistance, or color change) into a readable scale.\n\n### How it works (basic principle)\n\n1. **Temperature‑dependent property** – The thermometer relies on a material whose physical property changes predictably with temperature (e.g., mercury expands, a liquid’s volume changes, a resistor’s resistance varies, or a chemical’s color shifts).\n2. **Transduction** – That change is translated into a measurable quantity (length, voltage, color, etc.).\n3. **Calibration** – The device is calibrated against known temperature points (freezing and boiling points of water, or a standard reference) so that the output can be read on a scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).\n\n### Common types\n\n| Type | Working principle | Typical use |\n|------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Mercury‑in‑glass** | Mercury expands/contract in a glass tube; scale marked in °C/°F. | General‑purpose, laboratory, medical (historical). |\n| **Alcohol (or other liquid) thermometer** | Alcohol expands/contract; often used where mercury is unsafe. | Low‑temperature measurements, educational. |\n| **Digital (thermistor/RTD)** | Electrical resistance changes with temperature; read by a microcontroller. | Medical thermometers, kitchen, industrial. |\n| **Infrared (IR) thermometer** | Measures emitted infrared radiation; converts to temperature. | Non‑contact, high‑temperature, medical fever detection. |\n| **Bimetallic strip** | Two metals with different expansion rates bend with temperature; drives a pointer. | Thermostats, ovens, thermostatic valves. |\n| **Thermocouple** | Two dissimilar metals joined; voltage generated proportional to temperature difference. | High‑temperature industrial processes. |\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **Scale** – The units displayed (°C, °F, K).  \n- **Accuracy** – How close the reading is to the true temperature.  \n- **Precision** – How repeatable the measurement is.  \n- **Response time** – How quickly the thermometer reacts to temperature changes.\n\n### Why thermometers are important\n\n- **Health** – Detect fever or hypothermia.  \n- **Science** – Measure temperature in experiments.  \n- **Industry** – Control processes, ensure safety.  \n- **Everyday life** – Weather forecasts, cooking, HVAC.\n\nIn short, a thermometer is a calibrated instrument that translates a temperature‑dependent physical change into a readable numerical value, allowing us to quantify how hot or cold something is."

      "question": "What does `` Sitting Shiva '' mean ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Sitting Shiva** is a Jewish mourning practice that involves a period of close‑family mourning lasting **seven days** after a death. The term comes from the Hebrew word *shivah* (שִׁבָּה), meaning “seven.”  \n\n### Key aspects\n\n| Element | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Duration** | 7 consecutive days, starting the day after the funeral or burial. |\n| **Participants** | Immediate family members (parents, siblings, children, spouse, grandparents, aunts/uncles). |\n| **Setting** | Usually at the home of the deceased or a close relative; the mourners sit in a circle or in a designated area. |\n| **Activities** | • **Sitting** – mourners remain in the space, often with a single chair for the deceased’s body or a photograph. <br>• **Prayers** – recitation of the *Kaddish* (mourner’s prayer) and other liturgical texts. <br>• **Remembrance** – sharing memories, reading eulogies, or listening to music. <br>• **Support** – family and friends come to offer condolences, food, and assistance. |\n| **Symbols** | • **Covering the mirror** – to avoid vanity. <br>• **Removing jewelry** – symbolizing humility. <br>• **Eating simple food** – reflecting the seriousness of the period. |\n| **Purpose** | • To honor the deceased’s memory. <br>• To allow mourners to grieve in a supportive, communal setting. <br>• To observe a traditional, structured period of mourning that helps the bereaved transition. |\n\n### How it’s observed\n\n1. **Arrival** – Family members gather, often with a single chair for the deceased’s body or a photo.  \n2. **Prayers** – The *Kaddish* is recited daily, usually by a close relative or a rabbi.  \n3. **Remembrance** – Stories, photos, or eulogies are shared; sometimes a *Yizkor* (memorial prayer) is said.  \n4. **Support** – Friends and relatives bring meals, offer condolences, and help with household tasks.  \n5. **End of Shiva** – After the seventh day, the mourners may hold a *Yahrzeit* (anniversary) service or a *Yizkor* prayer on the anniversary of the death.\n\n### Cultural context\n\n- **Jewish law (Halacha)** prescribes the seven‑day mourning period for close relatives.  \n- The practice is common in Orthodox, Conservative, and many Reform communities, though the level of observance can vary.  \n- In modern times, some families may adapt the tradition (e.g., holding a virtual gathering) while keeping the core elements of remembrance and support.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** *Sitting Shiva* is a seven‑day Jewish mourning ritual where close family members gather to pray, remember, and support one another after a death."

      "question": "What is desktop publishing ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Desktop publishing (DP)** is the process of creating printed or digital documents—such as books, magazines, brochures, newsletters, flyers, and web pages—using a personal computer (PC) or laptop equipped with specialized software. It combines text, images, graphics, and layout design into a single workflow that can be printed or distributed electronically.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core components\n\n| Component | What it does |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| **Computer** | The workstation that runs the DP software. |\n| **Software** | Programs that provide layout, typography, and image editing tools (e.g., Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, Microsoft Publisher, Scribus). |\n| **Input devices** | Keyboard, mouse, scanner, digital camera, or tablet for capturing and editing content. |\n| **Output devices** | Printer (laser, inkjet, or professional press) and/or file export (PDF, EPUB, HTML). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical workflow\n\n1. **Planning & content gathering**  \n   - Outline the document structure.  \n   - Collect text, images, logos, and other assets.\n\n2. **Document setup**  \n   - Define page size, margins, columns, and grid systems.  \n   - Create master pages for consistent headers, footers, and page numbers.\n\n3. **Typography & text formatting**  \n   - Choose fonts, set point sizes, line spacing, and paragraph styles.  \n   - Apply styles for headings, body text, captions, etc.\n\n4. **Image and graphic placement**  \n   - Import and position images, clip paths, and vector graphics.  \n   - Adjust resolution, color profiles, and bleed settings.\n\n5. **Layout & design**  \n   - Arrange text and graphics on the page grid.  \n   - Use alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy to guide the reader’s eye.\n\n6. **Proofing & quality control**  \n   - Check for typographical errors, image resolution, and color consistency.  \n   - Generate a PDF/X‑1a or PDF/X‑4 file for print or a web‑ready file for digital distribution.\n\n7. **Output**  \n   - Print on a local printer or send the file to a commercial press.  \n   - Export to PDF, EPUB, HTML, or other formats for online use.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why it matters\n\n| Benefit | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Professional quality** | Precise control over typography, layout, and color gives a polished, print‑ready result. |\n| **Cost‑effective** | Eliminates the need for a full‑time typesetter or layout artist for small projects. |\n| **Speed** | Rapid iteration and real‑time preview reduce turnaround time. |\n| **Flexibility** | One file can be repurposed for multiple formats (print, web, e‑book). |\n| **Accessibility** | Many DP tools are user‑friendly, allowing non‑designers to produce high‑quality documents. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Common desktop publishing software\n\n| Software | Strengths | Typical users |\n|----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Adobe InDesign** | Industry standard, robust typography, advanced layout tools. | Professional designers, publishers. |\n| **QuarkXPress** | Strong page‑layout features, legacy support. | Print shops, large‑scale publishers. |\n| **Microsoft Publisher** | Easy to use, integrated with Office suite. | Small businesses, home users. |\n| **Scribus** | Free, open‑source, good for PDF/X output. | Hobbyists, small‑scale projects. |\n| **Affinity Publisher** | Affordable, modern UI, strong vector support. | Freelancers, small agencies. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop publishing vs. traditional publishing\n\n| Aspect | Desktop Publishing | Traditional Publishing |\n|--------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| **Control** | Full creative control by the user. | Editor and design team guide the process. |\n| **Cost** | Low upfront cost (software + hardware). | Higher cost (design, typesetting, printing). |\n| **Speed** | Fast, especially for small projects. | Longer lead times due to multiple stakeholders. |\n| **Scale** | Ideal for small runs or digital distribution. | Designed for large‑scale print runs. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nDesktop publishing is the modern, computer‑based method of designing, typesetting, and producing professional‑looking documents.

      "system_answer": [
        "**Mad cow disease**—scientifically known as **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded form of a protein called a prion, which accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, damaged tissue structure.\n\n### Key facts\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Cause** | Misfolded prion protein (PrP^Sc) that induces normal prion proteins (PrP^C) to misfold. |\n| **Transmission in cattle** | Primarily through contaminated feed (e.g., protein meal from infected animals). |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Weight loss, loss of coordination, abnormal gait, tremors, and eventually death (usually within 6–12 months). |\n| **Human risk** | **Variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**, a rare but fatal brain disorder, can be contracted by eating infected beef products. |\n| **Incidence** | Outbreaks began in the UK in the 1980s; since then, strict controls have reduced cases worldwide. |\n| **Control measures** | • Bans on feeding cattle with animal protein.<br>• Surveillance and testing of herds.<br>• Slaughterhouse inspections and removal of high‑risk tissues (brain, spinal cord). |\n| **Diagnosis** | Post‑mortem brain tissue examination (histopathology, immunohistochemistry). |\n| **Treatment** | None; the disease is invariably fatal. |\n| **Prevention for humans** | Avoid consumption of high‑risk tissues; most countries have strict regulations on beef products. |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Public health**: vCJD is a serious, incurable disease that has affected a handful of people worldwide.\n- **Agriculture**: BSE outbreaks can devastate cattle industries, leading to trade restrictions and economic losses.\n- **Scientific interest**: Prion diseases challenge our understanding of protein folding and infectious agents, as they lack nucleic acids.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nMad cow disease is a prion‑based neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can, in rare cases, transmit to humans as variant CJD. It is preventable through stringent feed‑regulation and surveillance, and it remains a critical issue for food safety and animal health."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is mainly hydrocarbons, but it also contains a variety of other gases.  The exact mix varies with the field, but a typical “dry” natural‑gas composition is:\n\n| Component | Typical range (by volume) | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; the main source of energy. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 10 % | Adds calorific value; used in petrochemical feedstock. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Often separated for use as LPG. |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 2 % | Includes n‑butane and iso‑butane. |\n| **Pentanes & higher hydrocarbons** | < 1 % | Minor fractions; can be removed for pipeline quality. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; dilutes the gas. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; removed for pipeline quality. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.01 % (often < 10 ppm) | Toxic; must be removed (sweetening). |\n| **Other trace gases** | < 0.01 % | Includes water vapor, helium, argon, methane‑derived gases, etc. |\n\n### Key points\n\n1. **Methane** is the energy‑rich core of natural gas; it provides about 90 % of the calorific value.\n2. **Higher hydrocarbons** (ethane, propane, butanes) are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks and are often separated from the gas stream.\n3. **Non‑combustible gases** (nitrogen, CO₂) dilute the energy content and must be controlled to meet pipeline specifications.\n4. **Impurities** such as H₂S, water vapor, and heavy hydrocarbons are removed during processing (sweetening, dehydration, fractionation) before the gas is transported or sold.\n5. The composition can vary widely: “wet” natural gas contains more higher hydrocarbons, while “dry” gas has a higher methane fraction.\n\nIn short, natural gas is a mixture dominated by methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons, nitrogen, CO₂, and trace impurities that are managed during processing."
