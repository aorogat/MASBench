      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. The deceased, Fidel, had a work‑related dispute with the killer.\",\"reasoning\":\"In the case, the most straightforward motive for the murder is a direct conflict between the victim and the perpetrator.  The narrative indicates that Fidel’s death was tied to a workplace disagreement, which is the most plausible explanation for why the killer would act.  The other options (dissatisfaction with Field’s defense, non‑repayment of money, or being extorted by Field) do not align with the established facts of the case and are less likely to be the primary motive.\"}",
