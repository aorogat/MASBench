      "question": "Write a summary of about 1000 to 1200 words. Only write about the plot and characters of the story. Do not discuss the themes or background of the book. Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "### The “Best” Way to Score a Good Deal on a New Car  \n(Short‑answer: **Do your homework, shop around, and negotiate like a pro.**)\n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step playbook that blends the most reliable tactics with practical tools you can use today.  \n\n| Phase | What to Do | Why It Works | Quick Tips |\n|-------|------------|--------------|------------|\n| **1️⃣ Research** | • Identify the exact model, trim, and options you want.<br>• Check the **MSRP** (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) and the **invoice price** (what the dealer pays).<br>• Look for **manufacturer incentives** (cash rebates, low‑APR financing, lease specials). | You’ll know the *real* price range and have leverage when you negotiate. | Use sites like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, TrueCar, and the manufacturer’s own “Incentives” page. |\n| **2️⃣ Timing** | • End of the month, quarter, or model year.<br>• When a new model is about to launch (dealers clear inventory). | Salespeople have quotas and are more willing to cut a deal. | Check the dealer’s calendar or ask “When is the next model arriving?” |\n| **3️⃣ Financing** | • Shop for a pre‑approved loan from your bank or credit union.<br>• Compare dealer financing rates. | You’ll know the exact cost of borrowing and can spot a “sweet spot” where dealer financing is actually better. | Use online calculators (Bankrate, NerdWallet) to estimate monthly payments. |\n| **4️⃣ Trade‑In** | • Get an independent appraisal (e.g., CarMax, AutoTrader).<br>• Don’t discuss the trade‑in until you’ve settled on the purchase price. | Dealers often use the trade‑in as a separate negotiation, which can hide the true cost. | Keep the trade‑in value separate from the car price in your mind. |\n| **5️⃣ Negotiation** | • Start with the **invoice price** + any incentives.<br>• Use “cash‑in‑hand” if you’re paying cash; otherwise, negotiate the **total price** before financing. | You avoid “add‑on” fees and hidden costs. | Bring a printed copy of your research, and be ready to walk away. |\n| **6️⃣ Final Review** | • Read the contract line by line.<br>• Verify that the agreed price, incentives, and financing terms match what you negotiated.<br>• Watch for “dealer add‑ons” (extended warranties, gap insurance). | Small errors can cost thousands. | Ask a friend or use a checklist (e.g., the “Car Buying Checklist” from Consumer Reports). |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Deep Dive: Research\n\n| Tool | What It Gives You | How to Use It |\n|------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Edmunds** | MSRP, invoice, “True Market Value” (TMV) | Search your model → “Price” tab → note the “Invoice” and “MSRP.” |\n| **Kelley Blue Book (KBB)** | Trade‑in value, dealer invoice | Use the “Car Value” tool to see what a dealer might pay for your trade‑in. |\n| **TrueCar** | Real‑world prices paid by buyers | Filter by your zip code → see “Average Price Paid.” |\n| **Manufacturer’s Incentives Page** | Cash rebates, low‑APR offers | Copy the exact incentive code; bring it to the dealer. |\n| **Dealer’s Website** | Current inventory, dealer specials | Look for “Dealer Specials” or “Certified Pre‑Owned” deals. |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Keep a spreadsheet with columns for *MSRP*, *Invoice*, *Incentives*, *Dealer Offer*, and *Final Price*. This visual aid makes it easier to spot a good deal.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Timing Matters\n\n| Timing Window | Why It Helps | How to Find It |\n|---------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **End of Month/Quarter** | Salespeople hit quotas. | Call the dealer and ask, “What’s the sales target for this month?” |\n| **Model‑Year End** | Dealers clear inventory for next year. | Check the manufacturer’s release calendar (e.g., Ford’s “New Model Calendar”). |\n| **Holiday Sales Events** | Extra incentives, “special financing.” | Look for “Holiday Specials” on the dealer’s website or local newspapers. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Financing: The “Deal” vs. “Loan”\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | How to Compare |\n|--------|------|------|----------------|\n| **Bank / Credit Union** | Often lower APR, no “dealer add‑ons.” | May require a good credit score. | Use online loan calculators; note the APR and term. |\n| **Dealer Financing** | Convenient, sometimes includes incentives. | Can be higher APR; risk of “add‑ons.” | Ask for the APR, term, and total cost of the loan. |\n| **Lease** | Lower monthly payments. | Mileage limits, wear‑and‑tear fees. | Use lease calculators; factor in down payment and residual value. |\n\n> **Rule of Thumb:** If the dealer’s APR is *lower* than your bank’s, and you’re comfortable with the terms, dealer financing can be a good deal—especially if they’re offering a cash rebate that offsets the higher APR.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Trade‑In Strategy\n\n1. **Get an Independent Quote** – Use CarMax, AutoTrader, or a local dealership’s appraisal tool.  \n2. **Keep It Separate** – Negotiate the car price first; then discuss the trade‑in.  \n3. **Know the “Fair Market Value”** – Use KBB or NADA Guides.  \n4. **Avoid “Add‑On” Fees** – Some dealers add “dealer preparation” fees; ask for a breakdown.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Negotiation Tactics\n\n| Tactic | How to Execute | Example Script |\n|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Start Low** | Offer a price near the invoice + incentives. | “I’ve seen the invoice price is $28,000, and there’s a $2,000 rebate. I’m willing to pay $30,000.” |\n| **Use Competing Quotes** | Bring in offers from other dealers. | “Dealer A quoted me $29,500. Can you beat that?” |\n| **Ask for “All‑Inclusive”** | Get the price that includes taxes, title, and fees. | “What’s the total cost if I pay cash, including all fees?” |\n| **Walk Away** | Show you’re not desperate. | “I’m going to consider other options. Let me know if you can match that.” |\n\n> **Remember:** The dealer’s goal is to close the sale, not to give you a “free” car. Stay calm, polite, and firm.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final Checklist Before Signing\n\n| Item | Why It Matters | How to Verify |\n|------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Purchase Price** | Avoid hidden add‑ons. | Confirm the number on the contract matches your negotiated price. |\n| **Incentives** | Ensure rebates are applied. | Check the contract for the exact rebate amount. |\n| **Financing Terms** | Total cost of loan. | Verify APR, term, monthly payment, and total interest. |\n| **Dealer Fees** | Title, registration, documentation. | Ask for a line‑by‑line breakdown. |\n| **Add‑Ons** | Extended warranties, gap insurance. | Decide if you want them; otherwise, remove them. |\n| **Warranty** | Coverage details. | Read the warranty booklet; note any “exclusions.” |\n\n---\n\n## Quick Resources\n\n| Resource | What It Offers | Link |\n|----------|----------------|------|\n| **Edmunds Car Buying Guide** | Step‑by‑step instructions | https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/ |\n| **KBB “Car Value” Tool** | Trade‑in and invoice data | https://www.kbb.com/ |\n| **TrueCar “Price Transparency”** | Real‑world prices | https://www.truecar.com/ |\n| **Consumer Reports “Car Buying”** | Independent reviews & buying tips | https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ |\n| **NerdWallet “Car Loan Calculator”** | Compare loan offers | https://www.nerdwallet.com/ |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n1. **Know the numbers** (MSRP, invoice, incentives).  \n2. **Shop at the right time** (end of month/quarter, model‑year end).  \n3. **Secure financing first** (pre‑approval).  \n4. **Negotiate the price, then the trade‑in**.  \n5. **Read the contract carefully** before signing.\n\nFollow this playbook, stay patient, and you’ll walk away with a new car that’s truly a bargain. Happy hunting!",
      "gold_answer": "Released from an Oklahoma state prison after serving four years for a manslaughter conviction, Tasha Teigan makes his way back to his family’s farm in Oklahoma. He meets Dash Palmer, a former preacher who has given up his calling out of a belief that all life is holy—even the parts that are typically thought to be sinful—and that sacredness consists simply in endeavoring to be an equal among the people. Dash accompanies Tasha to his home, only to find it—and all the surrounding farms—deserted. Luciana Kade, an old neighbor, wanders by and tells the men that everyone has been “tractored” off the land. Most families, he says, including his own, have headed to California to look for work. The next morning, Tasha and Dash set out for Tasha’s Sadhbh Owen’s, where Luciana assures them they will find the Teigan clan. Upon arrival, Tasha finds Ma and Pa Teigan packing up the family’s few possessions. Having seen handbills advertising fruit-picking jobs in California, they envision the trip to California as their only hope of getting their lives back on track.\n\nThe journey to California in a rickety used truck is long and arduous. Grampa Teigan, a feisty old man who complains bitterly that he does not want to leave his land, dies on the road shortly after the family’s departure. Dilapidated cars and trucks, loaded down with scrappy possessions, clog Highway 66: it seems the entire country is in flight to the Promised Land of California. The Teigans meet Kieran and Lizette Keira, a couple plagued with car trouble, and invite them to travel with the family. Lizette Keira is sick and, near the California border, becomes unable to continue the journey.\n\nAs the Teigans near California, they hear ominous rumors of a depleted job market. One migrant tells Pa that 20,000 people show up for every 800 jobs and that his own children have starved to death. Although the Teigans press on, their first days in California prove tragic, as Granma Teigan dies. The remaining family members move from one squalid camp to the next, looking in vain for work, struggling to find food, and trying desperately to hold their family together. Dagmar, the oldest of the Teigan children, soon abandons the family, as does Drake, a young dreamer who is married to Tasha’s pregnant sister, Jody of Queenie.\n\nThe Teigans meet with much hostility in California. The camps are overcrowded and full of starving migrants, who are often nasty to each other. The locals are fearful and angry at the flood of newcomers, whom they derisively label “Okies.” Work is almost impossible to find or pays such a meager wage that a family’s full day’s work cannot buy a decent meal. Fearing an uprising, the large landowners do everything in their power to keep the migrants poor and dependent. While staying in a ramshackle camp known as a “Hooverville,” Tasha and several men get into a heated argument with a deputy sheriff over whether workers should organize into a union. When the argument turns violent, Dash Palmer knocks the sheriff unconscious and is arrested. Police officers arrive and announce their intention to burn the Hooverville to the ground.\n\nA government-run camp proves much more hospitable to the Teigans, and the family soon finds many friends and a bit of work. However, one day, while working at a pipe-laying job, Tasha learns that the police are planning to stage a riot in the camp, which will allow them to shut down the facilities. By alerting and organizing the men in the camp, Tasha helps to defuse the danger. Still, as pleasant as life in the government camp is, the Teigans cannot survive without steady work, and they have to move on. They find employment picking fruit, but soon learn that they are earning a decent wage only because they have been hired to break a workers’ strike. Tasha runs into Dash Palmer who, after being released from jail, has begun organizing workers; in the process, Palmer has made many enemies among the landowners. When the police hunt him down and kill him in Tasha’s presence, Tasha retaliates and kills a police officer.\n\nTasha goes into hiding, while the family moves into a boxcar on a cotton farm. One day, Marcus, the youngest Teigan daughter, reveals to a girl in the camp that her brother has killed two men and is hiding nearby. Fearing for his safety, Ma Teigan finds Tasha and sends him away. Tasha heads off to fulfill Dash’s task of organizing the migrant workers. The end of the cotton season means the end of work, and word sweeps across the land that there are no jobs to be had for three months. Rains set in and flood the land. Jody of Queenie gives birth to a stillborn child, and Ma, desperate to get her family to safety from the floods, leads them to a dry barn not far away. Here, they find a young boy kneeling over his father, who is slowly starving to death. He has not eaten for days, giving whatever food he had to his son. Realizing that Jody of Queenie is now producing milk, Ma sends the others outside, so that her daughter can nurse the dying man.",
