      "question": "Write a summary of about 1000 to 1200 words. Only write about the plot and characters of the story. Do not discuss the themes or background of the book. Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "### The “Best” Way to Score a Good Deal on a New Car  \n(What “best” means can vary by situation, but the following checklist covers the most reliable, repeatable tactics that most buyers use to shave hundreds or even thousands off the sticker price.)\n\n| # | Step | Why It Works | Practical Tips |\n|---|------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1 | **Do Your Homework Early** | Knowing the market value and the car’s true cost lets you spot a “good” deal when you see it. | • Use **Kelley Blue Book (KBB)**, **Edmunds**, or **NADA Guides** to find the *MSRP*, *invoice price*, and *average transaction price*.<br>• Check the **Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)** and the *dealer invoice* (the price the dealer paid). The gap between the two is your negotiation cushion.<br>• Look at **dealer inventory levels** (e.g., via **TrueCar** or **Cars.com**). A dealer with a lot of stock may be more willing to negotiate. |\n| 2 | **Time Your Purchase** | Dealerships have sales quotas and monthly/quarterly targets. Buying when they’re under pressure can earn you a better price. | • **End of month, quarter, or year**: Salespeople need to hit numbers.<br>• **Model‑year change‑over** (late summer/early fall): New models arrive, older ones get discounted.<br>• **Holiday sales events** (e.g., Memorial Day, Labor Day, Black Friday) often come with manufacturer incentives. |\n| 3 | **Shop Around** | Prices can vary by dealer, region, and even by the salesperson. | • Get **at least 3–5 quotes** from different dealers (online and in‑person).<br>• Use **online quoting tools** (e.g., **Edmunds “Get Price”**, **KBB “Get Price”**) to get a baseline. |\n| 4 | **Know the Incentives** | Manufacturers offer rebates, low‑APR financing, or “cash‑back” offers that can be combined with dealer discounts. | • Check the manufacturer’s website for **current incentives**.<br>• Ask the dealer to apply all applicable rebates and financing offers. <br>• Don’t let the dealer “hide” a rebate; it should be reflected in the final price. |\n| 5 | **Negotiate the Out‑the‑Door Price, Not the Monthly Payment** | Focusing on the monthly payment can let the dealer shift costs into the loan term. | • Ask for the **total price** (including taxes, title, registration, dealer fees).<br>• If you’re financing, negotiate the loan terms (APR, term) *after* you’ve agreed on the price. |\n| 6 | **Leverage Your Trade‑In Wisely** | Dealers often use trade‑in value to offset the new car price, but you can get a better deal by negotiating separately. | • Get a **separate appraisal** for your trade‑in (e.g., via **KBB** or a local independent dealer).<br>• Negotiate the trade‑in *after* you’ve settled on the new car price. <br>• Avoid “bundling” the trade‑in with the new car price unless you’re sure it’s a fair value. |\n| 7 | **Use Financing as a Tool, Not a Default** | Dealer financing can be convenient, but pre‑approved loans or credit unions often offer better rates. | • Get a **pre‑approved loan** from your bank or credit union. <br>• Bring the loan offer to the dealer; they may match or beat it. <br>• If you’re buying a lease, compare lease offers from multiple dealers. |\n| 8 | **Watch for “Add‑On” Fees** | Dealers can add optional services (extended warranties, paint protection, VIN etching) that inflate the price. | • Decline add‑ons you don’t need. <br>• If you want an add‑on, negotiate its price separately. <br>• Verify that all fees are disclosed in writing before signing. |\n| 9 | **Ask About “Holdover” or “Holdback”** | Some manufacturers give dealers a “holdback” (a percentage of MSRP) that can be used to negotiate a lower price. | • While you can’t directly ask for the holdback, you can ask the dealer to “work the price” and see if they can give you a better deal. |\n| 10 | **Read the Fine Print** | Hidden fees or conditions can turn a good deal into a bad one. | • Review the **sales contract** line by line. <br>• Verify that the quoted price matches the contract. <br>• Check for “dealer add‑ons” or “extended warranties” that were not discussed. |\n| 11 | **Be Prepared to Walk Away** | The best leverage is the willingness to leave. | • If the dealer can’t meet your target price, be ready to go to another dealer or wait for a better incentive. <br>• Keep your budget in mind; don’t let the dealer pressure you into a higher price. |\n| 12 | **Use Technology** | Apps and websites can automate parts of the process. | • **TrueCar**: Shows what others paid for the same car.<br>• **CarGurus**: Highlights “Great Value” listings.<br>• **Autotrader**: Lets you filter by price, mileage, and dealer rating. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick‑Start Checklist (Before You Go to the Dealership)\n\n1. **Set a firm budget** (including taxes, fees, and insurance).  \n2. **Research the car’s MSRP, invoice, and average transaction price**.  \n3. **Identify any manufacturer incentives** (cash‑back, low‑APR).  \n4. **Get pre‑approved financing** (if you’re not using dealer financing).  \n5. **Collect at least 3 dealer quotes** (online or in‑person).  \n6. **Get a trade‑in appraisal** (if applicable).  \n7. **Prepare a list of must‑have features** and a list of “nice‑to‑have” add‑ons you’re willing to skip.  \n\n---\n\n## Sample Negotiation Script\n\n> **You:** “I’ve done my research. The invoice price for the 2025 Honda Civic LX is $22,500, and the average transaction price in my area is $23,200. I’m ready to buy today if we can agree on a price of $23,000. I also have a trade‑in that’s worth $5,000. Can we work that into the deal?”\n\n> **Dealer:** “We can’t go that low.”\n\n> **You:** “I’ve seen other dealers offering $23,000, and I have a pre‑approved loan at 3.5% APR. If we can’t meet that price, I’ll have to consider other options.”\n\n> **Dealer:** “Let me see what I can do.”\n\n> **You:** “Thank you. I’d also like to keep the extended warranty out of the contract unless it’s a significant discount.”\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n| Pitfall | Why It’s Bad | How to Avoid |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Focusing on monthly payment** | Can hide a higher overall price. | Ask for the total out‑the‑door price first. |\n| **Accepting add‑ons without negotiation** | Adds unnecessary cost. | Decline or negotiate each add‑on separately. |\n| **Not checking the final contract** | Hidden fees may appear after signing. | Review the contract line by line before signing. |\n| **Rushing into a deal** | Misses better incentives or lower prices elsewhere. | Take your time, compare, and be ready to walk away. |\n| **Ignoring financing options** | Dealer financing may be higher than your bank’s rate. | Compare dealer rates with pre‑approved loans. |\n\n---\n\n## Final Thought\n\nThe “best” deal is the one that aligns with your budget, your financing needs, and your desired vehicle features—while still giving you a price that’s below the average transaction price for that model in your area. By treating the purchase as a negotiation rather than a transaction, and by using data, timing, and a willingness to walk away, you’ll maximize your chances of getting a great deal on a new car. Happy hunting!",
