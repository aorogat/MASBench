      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the range of heart‑beat speeds (beats per minute, or bpm) that you aim to stay within during aerobic exercise to achieve specific fitness or health goals. It’s a way to gauge how hard your heart is working and to ensure you’re exercising at an intensity that’s effective yet safe.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Goal | Typical target heart‑rate zone | Why it’s useful |\n|------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Weight loss / calorie burn** | 50 – 70 % of maximum heart rate | Burns a good mix of fat and carbs while staying comfortable |\n| **Cardiovascular fitness** | 70 – 85 % of maximum heart rate | Improves heart and lung efficiency, raises VO₂ max |\n| **Endurance training** | 60 – 80 % of maximum heart rate | Builds stamina for longer sessions |\n| **High‑intensity interval training (HIIT)** | 80 – 95 % of maximum heart rate (short bursts) | Maximizes calorie burn and anaerobic capacity |\n\n---\n\n### How to calculate it\n\n1. **Find your maximum heart rate (MHR)**  \n   The most common estimate:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{MHR} = 220 - \\text{age}\n   \\]\n   (e.g., a 30‑year‑old → 190 bpm)\n\n2. **Determine the target zone**  \n   Multiply the MHR by the desired percentage.  \n   *Example:* 70 % of 190 bpm = 133 bpm.\n\n3. **Use a heart‑rate monitor or pulse check**  \n   - **Chest strap** or **smartwatch** gives continuous readings.  \n   - **Manual check**: Count beats for 15 seconds, multiply by 4.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference table (age 30)\n\n| % of MHR | Target bpm | Intensity |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n| 50 % | 95 | Light |\n| 60 % | 114 | Moderate |\n| 70 % | 133 | Moderate‑vigorous |\n| 80 % | 152 | Vigorous |\n| 90 % | 171 | Very vigorous |\n\n---\n\n### Tips for staying in the zone\n\n- **Warm up** (5–10 min) to gradually raise heart rate.  \n- **Use a monitor** if you’re new to training or have health concerns.  \n- **Check your breathing**: If you’re gasping, you’re likely above the target.  \n- **Cool down** (5–10 min) to let heart rate fall safely.\n\n---\n\n### When to adjust\n\n- **Improving fitness**: Gradually shift the upper bound of your zone higher (e.g., from 70 % to 75 %).  \n- **Recovery days**: Stay in the lower 50–60 % zone.  \n- **Medical conditions**: Consult a healthcare professional; they may prescribe a specific target range.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nTarget heart rate is a personalized, percentage‑based guide that helps you exercise at the right intensity for your goals—whether that’s burning calories, building endurance, or improving heart health. Use it as a tool, not a strict rule—listen to your body and adjust as needed.",

It is one of the 20 standard amino acids that make up proteins and plays several key roles in the body:\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Chemical identity** | α‑amino‑α‑hydroxy‑benzyl‑alanine (C₉H₁₁NO₂) |\n| **Structure** | Contains a benzyl side chain (a phenyl ring) attached to the α‑carbon. |\n| **Dietary sources** | Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, nuts, seeds, and many plant‑based proteins. |\n| **Metabolic role** | 1. **Protein synthesis** – incorporated into proteins during translation. 2. **Precursor to tyrosine** – via the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. 3. **Neurotransmitter precursors** – tyrosine is further converted to L‑dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. |\n| **Clinical relevance** | • **Phenylketonuria (PKU)** – a genetic disorder where phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient, leading to toxic accumulation of phenylalanine. Patients must follow a low‑phenylalanine diet. <br>• **Dietary supplements** – sometimes used for mood support or as a precursor to neurotransmitters, though evidence is mixed. |\n| **Safety** | Normal dietary intake is safe. Excessive intake (e.g., from supplements) can cause side effects such as headaches, nausea, or, in PKU patients, severe neurological damage. |\n\n**In short:** Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins that also serves as a precursor to important neurotransmitters and is essential for normal growth and development.",

      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—proteins (or, in a few cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.  \n\n---\n\n### 1.  Core Characteristics  \n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Catalytic** | They lower the activation energy of a reaction, making it proceed faster. |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one particular substrate (or a very small set of substrates) and at a specific site on that substrate. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be turned on or off by various mechanisms (allosteric effectors, covalent modification, changes in pH/temperature, etc.). |\n| **Reusability** | After the reaction, the enzyme remains unchanged and can catalyze many more cycles. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How Enzymes Work  \n\n1. **Substrate Binding** – The substrate fits into the enzyme’s **active site** (a pocket or groove shaped like a lock).  \n2. **Transition State Stabilization** – The enzyme stabilizes the transition state of the reaction, lowering the energy barrier.  \n3. **Product Release** – After the reaction, the product(s) leave the active site, freeing the enzyme for another round.\n\n*Illustration:*  \n```\nEnzyme + Substrate  ⇌  Enzyme–Substrate  →  Enzyme + Product\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Types of Enzymes (by reaction type)\n\n| Class | Reaction Type | Example |\n|-------|---------------|---------|\n| **Oxidoreductases** | Redox reactions | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| **Transferases** | Transfer functional groups | Alanine transaminase |\n| **Hydrolases** | Hydrolysis (adding water) | Amylase (breaks starch) |\n| **Lyases** | Add or remove groups without hydrolysis | Aldolase |\n| **Isomerases** | Rearrange atoms within a molecule | Phosphoglucose isomerase |\n| **Ligases** | Join two molecules with ATP | DNA ligase |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Why Enzymes Matter  \n\n| Biological Role | Why it’s important |\n|-----------------|--------------------|\n| **Metabolism** | Drive catabolic and anabolic pathways (e.g., glycolysis, DNA replication). |\n| **Signal Transduction** | Modulate signaling molecules (e.g., kinases, phosphatases). |\n| **Defense** | Break down pathogens or toxins (e.g., proteases in immune cells). |\n| **Industrial & Medical** | Used in food processing, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and biotechnology (e.g., PCR uses DNA polymerase). |\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Key Points to Remember  \n\n- **Enzymes are proteins** (except ribozymes, which are RNA enzymes).  \n- **They are highly specific**—the “lock‑and‑key” or “induced fit” model explains this.  \n- **They are regulated** to meet the cell’s needs (feedback inhibition, gene expression, post‑translational modifications).  \n- **They are essential** for life; without enzymes, biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to sustain cellular processes.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Enzymes are the workhorses of biochemistry—specialized proteins that speed up the myriad reactions required for life, all while being reused again and again.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Because of the way Earth’s atmosphere scatters sunlight.**  \n\n| Step | What happens | Why it looks yellow |\n|------|--------------|---------------------|\n| 1. **Sun emits white light** | The Sun’s surface (≈ 5 800 K) radiates a nearly perfect black‑body spectrum that contains all visible wavelengths (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet). | The Sun itself is *white* (or slightly yellowish‑white) when seen from space. |\n| 2. **Light travels through the atmosphere** | As sunlight enters Earth’s atmosphere, molecules (N₂, O₂) and tiny aerosols scatter shorter‑wavelength light (blue, violet) more strongly than longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow). This is Rayleigh scattering. | Blue light is scattered in all directions, so the sky looks blue. |\n| 3. **Observer’s line of sight** | When you look straight up at the Sun, the path through the atmosphere is relatively short, so only a modest amount of blue light is scattered out of the beam. The remaining light is dominated by the longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red). | The Sun appears **yellow** (or slightly orange‑white) to an observer on Earth. |\n| 4. **Sunrise/sunset** | The Sun’s light passes through a much longer atmospheric path, scattering almost all blue light out of the beam. The remaining light is mostly red/orange, giving the Sun a reddish hue. | The Sun looks red or orange at dawn/dusk. |\n\n### Quick Summary\n\n- **Sunlight is white** (contains all colors).  \n- **Atmospheric scattering** removes most of the blue light from the direct beam.  \n- **What remains** is a mixture of yellow, orange, and red, so the Sun looks yellow to us.\n\nIf you were to observe the Sun from space, or from a high‑altitude balloon with a thin atmosphere, it would appear white. The “yellow” is an optical effect caused by Earth’s atmosphere.",

      "question": "What is foot and mouth disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD)** is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hooved animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, deer, and many wildlife species). It is caused by a member of the *Picornaviridae* family, the *Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease Virus* (FMDV), which has seven distinct serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1).  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why it matters\n\n| Aspect | Why it’s important |\n|--------|--------------------|\n| **Economic impact** | Outbreaks can lead to massive culls, trade bans, and loss of productivity. In 2001 the UK outbreak cost the country ~£8 billion. |\n| **Animal welfare** | Affects millions of animals worldwide, causing pain, loss of weight, and in some cases death. |\n| **Public health** | The virus is not a human pathogen, but the disease can affect food safety and trade. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the virus works\n\n- **Structure**: FMDV is a small, non‑enveloped, single‑stranded RNA virus (~12 nm diameter).  \n- **Replication**: It hijacks the host cell’s ribosomes to produce viral proteins, assembling new virions that are released into the bloodstream and saliva.  \n- **Transmission**:  \n  - **Direct contact** with infected animals or contaminated bodily fluids (saliva, milk, feces).  \n  - **Indirect contact** via contaminated equipment, clothing, or vehicles.  \n  - **Airborne spread** over short distances (up to a few kilometers).  \n  - **Wildlife vectors** (e.g., wild boar, deer) can carry the virus across borders.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Clinical signs\n\n| System | Typical signs |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Oral cavity** | Red, ulcerated lesions on the tongue, lips, and inside the mouth. |\n| **Feet** | Vesicles (blisters) on the interdigital skin and hooves, leading to lameness. |\n| **General** | Fever, decreased appetite, weight loss, and in severe cases, death (especially in young animals). |\n| **Reproductive** | In pregnant sows, abortion or stillbirths may occur. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical observation** (rapid, but not definitive).  \n- **Laboratory tests**:  \n  - **Virus isolation** in cell culture.  \n  - **RT‑PCR** (reverse‑transcription polymerase chain reaction) for viral RNA.  \n  - **Serology** (ELISA) to detect antibodies, useful for surveillance.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Control & Prevention\n\n| Measure | How it works |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Vaccination** | In endemic regions, live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines are used. Vaccines must match circulating serotypes. |\n| **Movement restrictions** | Quarantine of infected or exposed herds; bans on animal transport. |\n| **Culling** | In many countries, infected and exposed animals are slaughtered to stop spread. |\n| **Biosecurity** | Strict hygiene, disinfection of equipment, controlled access to farms. |\n| **Surveillance** | Routine testing of high‑risk areas and species. |\n| **International cooperation** | The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) coordinates reporting and response. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Global status\n\n- **Endemic** in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  \n- **Eradicated** in the United States (except for a few isolated outbreaks in the 1970s–80s) and in the European Union (after the 2001 UK outbreak).  \n- **High‑risk** for trade: many countries impose strict import restrictions on animals and animal products from FMD‑affected regions.\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can humans get FMD?** | No, the virus does not infect humans. However, people can handle infected animals or contaminated products safely with proper hygiene. |\n| **Is it a food safety issue?** | The virus is inactivated by cooking, so food from infected animals is safe if properly processed. |\n| **How long does the virus survive outside a host?** | FMDV can survive in the environment for days to weeks, depending on temperature and humidity. |\n| **What’s the incubation period?** | 2–14 days, typically 4–7 days. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a **highly contagious viral disease** that devastates livestock production and trade. Its control relies on vaccination, strict biosecurity, rapid detection, and coordinated international response.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation And Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and characterize objects or features in a medium—most commonly water, but also air, ice, and even solid materials. It works by emitting a sound pulse (the “ping”) and listening for echoes that bounce back from objects or boundaries.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Basic Principle\n\n| Step | What happens | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Transmission** | A transducer (speaker‑like device) emits a short burst of acoustic energy at a chosen frequency. | The pulse travels through the medium at the speed of sound (≈ 1500 m/s in seawater). |\n| **Propagation** | The pulse travels until it encounters a boundary with a different acoustic impedance (e.g., water‑to‑rock, water‑to‑air). | The impedance mismatch causes part of the wave to reflect back. |\n| **Reflection** | The reflected wave (echo) returns to the transducer. | The echo’s time‑of‑flight and amplitude carry information about distance, size, shape, and material. |\n| **Reception & Processing** | The transducer switches to receiver mode, amplifies the echo, and a signal‑processing unit converts it into a readable format (range, depth, image). | Enables mapping, navigation, or object identification. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | How it works | Typical use |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Navigation, depth sounding, fish‑finding, submarine detection. |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., marine mammals, ships). | Anti‑submarine warfare, wildlife monitoring. |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses perpendicular to the vessel’s path, producing high‑resolution images of the seafloor. | Mine detection, archaeological surveys. |\n| **Multibeam Echo Sounder** | Sends multiple beams at different angles to map bathymetry in 3‑D. | Hydrographic charting, offshore construction. |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Uses high‑frequency pulses to create detailed images of objects (e.g., fish schools, underwater structures). | Fisheries, underwater archaeology. |\n| **Subbottom Profiling** | Sends low‑frequency pulses that penetrate the seabed to reveal sediment layers. | Geophysical surveys, oil & gas exploration. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Meaning | Typical Range |\n|-----------|---------|---------------|\n| **Frequency** | Determines resolution vs. penetration. | 10 kHz–1 MHz (low freq for deep penetration, high freq for fine detail). |\n| **Pulse Length** | Duration of the emitted sound. | Short pulses (µs) for high resolution; longer pulses for better signal‑to‑noise. |\n| **Beamwidth** | Angular spread of the transmitted beam. | Narrow beams (few degrees) for precise targeting; wide beams for area coverage. |\n| **Range** | Distance to the target. | From a few meters (e.g., fish finder) to several kilometers (e.g., submarine detection). |\n| **Signal‑to‑Noise Ratio (SNR)** | Quality of the echo relative to background noise. | Higher SNR → clearer images and more reliable detections. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Common Applications\n\n| Field | Example |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Naval & Military** | Submarine detection, mine countermeasures, underwater surveillance. |\n| **Commercial Shipping** | Navigation, collision avoidance, depth monitoring. |\n| **Marine Biology** | Studying fish schools, mapping habitats, monitoring marine mammals. |\n| **Geophysics & Oil & Gas** | Seafloor mapping, sub‑seafloor stratigraphy, pipeline inspection. |\n| **Archaeology** | Locating shipwrecks, mapping submerged sites. |\n| **Recreation** | Fish finders for anglers, underwater photography. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  How Sonar Differs from Radar\n\n| Feature | Sonar | Radar |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| **Medium** | Water (or other dense media) | Air |\n| **Speed of Propagation** | ~1500 m/s (water) | ~3 × 10⁸ m/s (light) |\n| **Typical Frequency** | kHz–MHz | MHz–GHz |\n| **Resolution** | Limited by wavelength; lower than radar for same frequency. | Higher resolution due to shorter wavelengths. |\n| **Range** | Usually shorter (tens of km) | Can reach hundreds of km. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can sonar be used in air?** | Yes—airborne sonar (e.g., for detecting buried objects) exists, but it’s less common than radar because sound travels slower and is more easily absorbed. |\n| **Does sonar damage marine life?** | High‑intensity sonar can disturb marine mammals, especially at low frequencies. Regulations limit usage in sensitive areas. |\n| **What is “ping” in sonar?** | The emitted acoustic pulse; the term comes from the audible “ping” sound in early sonar systems. |\n| **How is depth measured?** | By timing the echo: depth = (speed of sound × time‑of‑flight) / 2. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSonar is a versatile acoustic sensing technology that lets us “see” underwater (or in other media) by sending sound waves and interpreting the echoes that return. Its principles are simple, but its applications range from everyday fishing gadgets to sophisticated naval warfare systems.",

It is considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning the nervous system amplifies pain signals.\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain that lasts at least three months and is present on both sides of the body and above and below the waist. |\n| **Tender points** | Historically, 18 specific spots on the body that are especially sensitive when pressed. (The 2010 ACR criteria no longer require tender‑point testing, but many clinicians still use it.) |\n| **Fatigue & sleep problems** | Patients often feel exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep, and may have non‑restorative sleep or insomnia. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and a sense of mental sluggishness. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, anxiety, and sometimes autonomic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, heart palpitations). |\n\n### Causes & Pathophysiology\n- **Central sensitization**: The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) becomes hypersensitive, amplifying pain signals.\n- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history increases risk.\n- **Triggers**: Physical injury, infection, stress, or sleep deprivation can precipitate or worsen symptoms.\n- **Neurochemical changes**: Altered levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, substance P) and dysregulation of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) axis.\n\n### Diagnosis\n- **Clinical evaluation**: History of widespread pain ≥3 months, plus at least 11 of 19 tender points (if using the older criteria) or a positive *Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire* (FIQ) score.\n- **Rule out other conditions**: Blood tests, imaging, or other labs to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease, etc.\n\n### Treatment\nFibromyalgia is managed with a multimodal approach:\n\n| Modality | Typical agents or strategies |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n| **Medications** | - **Pain relievers**: acetaminophen, NSAIDs (though limited efficacy). <br> - **Antidepressants**: duloxetine, milnacipran, amitriptyline (help with pain, sleep, mood). <br> - **Anticonvulsants**: pregabalin, gabapentin (target neuropathic pain). |\n| **Physical therapy** | Low‑impact aerobic exercise, stretching, strength training. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps modify pain perception, coping strategies, and sleep hygiene. |\n| **Lifestyle** | Regular sleep schedule, stress reduction (mindfulness, yoga), balanced diet. |\n| **Complementary therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, tai chi, biofeedback (evidence varies). |\n\n### Prognosis\n- **Chronic condition**: Symptoms can persist for years, but many patients achieve significant improvement with treatment.\n- **Variable course**: Some experience flare‑ups; others have periods of remission.\n\n### Key Takeaway\nFibromyalgia is a complex, chronic pain syndrome that involves heightened pain sensitivity, fatigue, and a host of other symptoms. While its exact cause remains unclear, a combination of medication, exercise, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",

      "question": "How much does water weigh ?",
      "system_answer": "**Water’s weight is determined by its density, which is essentially the same as its mass per unit volume.**  \nBecause “weight” is a force, the exact number depends on gravity, but for everyday purposes we usually quote the mass (or “weight” in a casual sense) of a given volume of water.\n\n| Volume | Mass (≈) | Weight (≈) | Notes |\n|--------|----------|------------|-------|\n| **1 m³** (1 cubic meter) | 1 000 kg | 9 806 N (≈ 2 204 lb‑force) | Standard density at 4 °C |\n| **1 L** (1 liter) | 1 000 g = 1 kg | 9.81 N (≈ 2.20 lb‑force) | 1 kg ≈ 2.20 lb |\n| **1 gal (US)** (3.785 L) | 3.785 kg | 37.1 N (≈ 8.34 lb‑force) | 1 gal ≈ 8.34 lb |\n| **1 gal (UK)** (4.546 L) | 4.546 kg | 44.6 N (≈ 10.04 lb‑force) | 1 gal ≈ 10.04 lb |\n| **1 ft³** (0.0283 m³) | 28.3 kg | 278 N (≈ 62.3 lb‑force) | 1 ft³ ≈ 62.3 lb |\n\n### Why the numbers are “≈”\n\n- **Temperature**: Water’s density peaks at about 4 °C (≈ 1 g / cm³). At higher temperatures it’s slightly less dense (e.g., 20 °C → 0.998 g / cm³).  \n- **Gravity**: Weight = mass × g. On Earth, g ≈ 9.81 m/s². If you’re on a different planet, the weight changes proportionally.  \n- **Purity**: Saltwater or water with dissolved solids is heavier; pure distilled water is the reference.\n\n### Quick “rule of thumb”\n\n- **1 liter of water ≈ 2.2 pounds** (≈ 1 kg).  \n- **1 US gallon ≈ 8.34 pounds**.  \n- **1 cubic meter ≈ 2 204 pounds**.\n\nSo, when someone asks “how much does water weigh?” you can answer: **“About 1 kg per liter (≈ 2.2 lb), or 1 m³ weighs roughly 1 000 kg (≈ 2 204 lb) under standard Earth gravity.”**",

Optical prism (physics)\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Material** | Transparent, usually glass or crystal (e.g., crown glass, flint glass). |\n| **Shape** | Typically a triangular wedge (most common is a right‑angle or equilateral triangle). |\n| **Function** | Refracts (bends) light due to a change in refractive index. |\n| **Key properties** | - **Dispersion**: Different wavelengths bend by different amounts, separating white light into a spectrum.<br>- **Deviation angle**: The angle by which the light ray is turned depends on the prism’s apex angle and the refractive index. |\n| **Common uses** | - **Spectroscopy** (analyzing light spectra).<br>- **Optical instruments** (e.g., binoculars, cameras).<br>- **Educational demonstrations** (showing refraction and dispersion). |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Incidence**: Light enters the prism at one face.  \n2. **Refraction**: The ray bends toward the normal because glass has a higher refractive index than air.  \n3. **Exit**: The ray refracts again at the second face, emerging at a different direction.  \n4. **Dispersion**: Because the refractive index varies with wavelength, blue light bends more than red light, producing a rainbow.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Everyday examples\n\n| Example | Context |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Eyeglass prism** | Small prisms in glasses correct eye alignment (e.g., for double vision). |\n| **Prism in a camera** | A prism can redirect light from the lens to the viewfinder. |\n| **Prism in a prism spectrometer** | Splits sunlight into a spectrum for analysis. |\n| **Prism in a prism flashlight** | Uses a prism to spread light into a beam. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Quick facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **First recorded use** | Ancient Greeks used triangular prisms to study refraction (e.g., Pythagoras). |\n| **Common materials** | Crown glass (n≈1.52), flint glass (n≈1.65), quartz, acrylic. |\n| **Typical apex angles** | 60°, 90°, 120° (right‑angle prisms are common). |\n| **Spectral range** | Visible light (400–700 nm) is most commonly split; prisms can also work in UV or IR with suitable materials. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Mathematically**, a prism is a 3‑D shape with two parallel bases and parallelogram sides.  \n- **Optically**, a prism is a transparent wedge that refracts and disperses light, turning white light into a rainbow.  \n\nBoth uses share the same basic geometry but serve very different purposes—one in geometry and engineering, the other in optics and physics.",

What “engine displacement” means\n\n- **Displacement** is the volume of air/fuel mixture that the engine can draw in (or expel) in one cycle.  \n- For a four‑stroke engine, one cycle is two crankshaft revolutions.  \n- The larger the displacement, the more air/fuel can be combusted, which usually means more power (though other factors—compression ratio, valve timing, turbocharging, etc.—also matter).\n\n### How it’s calculated\n\nFor a single cylinder:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\times \\text{bore}^2 \\times \\text{stroke}\n\\]\n\n- **Bore** = diameter of the cylinder.  \n- **Stroke** = distance the piston travels.\n\nFor the whole engine:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Displacement} = \\text{Volume per cylinder} \\times \\text{number of cylinders}\n\\]\n\nThe result is expressed in cubic centimeters (cc).  \n1 liter = 1 000 cc, so a 1.6 L engine is 1 600 cc.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why “cc” is used\n\n- **Historical**: The metric system was adopted in many countries in the 20th century, and cc became the standard way to describe engine size.  \n- **Practical**: It’s a straightforward, unit‑based measure that can be compared across engines, regardless of design (inline, V‑type, boxer, etc.).  \n- **Regulatory**: Many tax, insurance, and licensing systems use cc to classify vehicles (e.g., “125 cc motorcycle” vs. “500 cc”).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Typical cc ranges\n\n| Vehicle type | Common cc range | Example |\n|--------------|-----------------|---------|\n| **Motorcycles** | 50 – 125 cc (entry‑level) | 125 cc sportbike |\n| | 125 – 250 cc (mid‑range) | 250 cc cruiser |\n| | 250 – 600 cc (sport/standard) | 600 cc supersport |\n| | 600 – 1000 cc (touring, high‑performance) | 1000 cc touring |\n| | 1000 + cc (superbike, racing) | 1000 cc superbike |\n| **Cars** | 1 000 – 1 600 cc (sub‑compact) | 1.4 L (1400 cc) |\n| | 1 600 – 2 200 cc (compact) | 2.0 L (2000 cc) |\n| | 2 200 – 3 000 cc (mid‑size) | 2.5 L (2500 cc) |\n| | 3 000 – 4 500 cc (large) | 3.5 L (3500 cc) |\n| | 4 500 + cc (performance, V‑8, V‑12) | 5.0 L (5000 cc) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. What cc does **not** tell you\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|---------|\n| “Higher cc = more horsepower.” | Not always. A small, high‑revving engine can produce more power than a large, low‑revving one. |\n| “cc = fuel consumption.” | Fuel economy depends on many factors (efficiency, driving style, weight, aerodynamics). |\n| “cc = torque.” | Torque is related to displacement but also to compression, cam profile, intake/exhaust design, etc. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick conversion cheat sheet\n\n| Metric | Imperial |\n|--------|----------|\n| 1 cc | 0.061 in³ |\n| 1 L (1000 cc) | 61.024 in³ |\n| 1 L | 0.264 gal |\n| 1 L | 0.219 ft³ |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom line\n\n- **CC** is simply the engine’s *total swept volume* in cubic centimeters.  \n- It’s a useful shorthand for comparing engine sizes, but it’s only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to performance, efficiency, or suitability for a particular vehicle.  \n- When you see “125 cc motorcycle” or “2.0 L car,” you’re looking at the engine’s displacement, not its power output.",

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": "### Ulcer – A Quick Overview\n\n| Term | What it means |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Ulcer** | A sore or open lesion that develops on the skin or mucous membranes, usually due to a break in the tissue’s protective lining. |\n| **Common sites** | Stomach (gastric ulcer), duodenum (duodenal ulcer), mouth (canker sore), skin (pressure ulcer), and the lining of the esophagus (esophageal ulcer). |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Ulcers Form\n\n| Factor | How it contributes |\n|--------|--------------------|\n| **Acid or enzymes** | In the stomach/duodenum, excess gastric acid or pepsin can erode the mucosal lining. |\n| **Bacterial infection** | *Helicobacter pylori* (H. pylori) colonizes the stomach lining and weakens it. |\n| **Medications** | NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) and steroids irritate or damage mucosa. |\n| **Physical pressure** | Prolonged pressure on skin (e.g., bed‑sores) cuts off blood flow, leading to tissue death. |\n| **Lifestyle factors** | Smoking, alcohol, stress, and poor nutrition can impair healing and increase acid production. |\n| **Underlying disease** | Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or other inflammatory conditions can cause ulcers in the intestines. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Types of Ulcers\n\n| Type | Typical location | Key features |\n|------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic ulcer** | Stomach or duodenum | Burning epigastric pain, often relieved or worsened by food. |\n| **Esophageal ulcer** | Upper GI tract | Pain with swallowing, possible bleeding. |\n| **Canker sore (aphthous ulcer)** | Oral mucosa | Small, round, painful lesions that heal in 1–2 weeks. |\n| **Pressure ulcer (bed sore)** | Skin over bony prominences | Redness → shallow ulcer → deep tissue loss. |\n| **Venous stasis ulcer** | Lower leg | Usually on the medial malleolus, with a shallow, irregular base. |\n| **Diabetic ulcer** | Foot | Often painless due to neuropathy; high risk of infection. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Symptoms to Watch For\n\n| Symptom | What it suggests |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **Pain** | Burning or gnawing in the upper abdomen (peptic), throbbing in the mouth (canker), or localized skin pain. |\n| **Bleeding** | Vomiting blood, black tarry stools, or bright red blood from a wound. |\n| **Weight loss / loss of appetite** | Common in gastric ulcers. |\n| **Anemia** | Chronic blood loss can lead to fatigue, pallor. |\n| **Skin changes** | Redness, swelling, or necrosis in pressure ulcers. |\n| **Infection signs** | Redness, warmth, pus, fever. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it tells you |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Endoscopy** | Direct visualization of stomach/duodenum; allows biopsy. |\n| **Urea breath test** | Detects H. pylori infection. |\n| **Stool antigen test** | Non‑invasive H. pylori detection. |\n| **Blood tests** | Check for anemia, infection markers. |\n| **Imaging (X‑ray, CT)** | For deep ulcers or complications (perforation). |\n| **Wound assessment** | For skin ulcers: depth, tissue type, infection. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Treatment\n\n| Condition | First‑line therapy |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| **Peptic ulcer** | • **Antibiotics** (clarithromycin + amoxicillin or metronidazole) to eradicate H. pylori. <br>• **Proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs)** (omeprazole, esomeprazole) to reduce acid. <br>• **H2 blockers** (ranitidine) if PPI not tolerated. |\n| **NSAID‑related ulcer** | Stop NSAID; use PPIs or H2 blockers; consider COX‑2 selective NSAIDs if needed. |\n| **Canker sore** | Topical corticosteroids, lidocaine gels, or oral rinses; maintain oral hygiene. |\n| **Pressure ulcer** | Off‑loading pressure (special mattresses), wound cleaning, debridement, moist dressings, infection control. |\n| **Venous stasis ulcer** | Compression therapy, elevation, skin care, treat underlying venous insufficiency. |\n| **Diabetic ulcer** | Off‑loading, glycemic control, infection management, advanced wound care (negative‑pressure therapy, skin grafts). |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Prevention Tips\n\n| Strategy | Why it helps |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Avoid unnecessary NSAIDs** | Reduces mucosal irritation. |\n| **Use PPIs or H2 blockers when on chronic NSAIDs** | Protects stomach lining. |\n| **Quit smoking & limit alcohol** | Improves mucosal healing and reduces acid. |\n| **Maintain a balanced diet** | Adequate protein & vitamins support tissue repair. |\n| **Manage stress** | Stress hormones can increase acid secretion. |\n| **Regular skin checks for at‑risk patients** | Early detection of pressure or diabetic ulcers. |\n| **Proper footwear & foot care for diabetics** | Prevents trauma and infection. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nAn ulcer is a break in the protective lining of a tissue—whether in the stomach, mouth, skin, or elsewhere—caused by a mix of mechanical, chemical, infectious, or vascular factors. Prompt diagnosis and targeted treatment (antibiotics, acid suppression, wound care) usually lead to healing, but prevention and early intervention are key to avoiding complications.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "## Compound Interest – The “Interest on Interest” Explained\n\n| Concept | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Compound interest** | The interest earned on a principal amount **plus** any interest that has already accumulated. |\n| **Compounding frequency** | How often the earned interest is added to the principal (daily, monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.). |\n| **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)** | The true yearly return when compounding occurs more than once a year. |\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Basic Formula\n\nFor a principal \\(P\\), annual nominal interest rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal), compounding \\(n\\) times per year, and time \\(t\\) in years:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = amount after \\(t\\) years (principal + interest)\n- \\(P\\) = initial principal\n- \\(r\\) = annual nominal rate (e.g., 5 % → 0.05)\n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year\n- \\(t\\) = number of years\n\n**Example**  \n$1,000 invested at 6 % compounded monthly for 3 years:\n\n\\[\nA = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  = 1000 \\left(1 + 0.005\\right)^{36}\n  \\approx 1000 \\times 1.197 \\approx \\$1,197\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why It Matters\n\n| Feature | Simple Interest | Compound Interest |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Interest calculation** | Only on the original principal. | On the principal **plus** all previously earned interest. |\n| **Growth over time** | Linear. | Exponential – grows faster the longer it compounds. |\n| **Typical use** | Short‑term loans, simple savings. | Savings accounts, bonds, mortgages, retirement accounts. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Compounding Frequency Matters\n\n| Frequency | Formula adjustment | Example (5 % on $1,000 for 1 year) |\n|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Annually** | \\(n = 1\\) | \\(A = 1000(1+0.05)^1 = \\$1,050\\) |\n| **Semi‑annually** | \\(n = 2\\) | \\(A = 1000(1+0.025)^2 = \\$1,050.63\\) |\n| **Quarterly** | \\(n = 4\\) | \\(A = 1000(1+0.0125)^4 = \\$1,050.95\\) |\n| **Monthly** | \\(n = 12\\) | \\(A = 1000(1+0.0041667)^{12} = \\$1,051.16\\) |\n| **Daily** | \\(n = 365\\) | \\(A = 1000(1+0.00013699)^{365} = \\$1,051.27\\) |\n\nThe more frequent the compounding, the higher the final amount.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Continuous Compounding\n\nWhen compounding occurs an infinite number of times per year, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\) (Euler’s number)\n\n**Example**  \n$1,000 at 5 % for 1 year continuously compounded:\n\n\\[\nA = 1000 \\, e^{0.05 \\times 1} \\approx 1000 \\times 1.05127 = \\$1,051.27\n\\]\n\nContinuous compounding gives the theoretical maximum for a given nominal rate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Effective Annual Rate (EAR)\n\nEAR shows the true annual return when compounding is more frequent than once a year:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n} - 1\n\\]\n\n**Example**  \n6 % nominal rate compounded monthly:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EAR} = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1\n           \\approx 1.0617 - 1 = 0.0617 \\text{ or } 6.17\\%\n\\]\n\nSo the effective yield is 6.17 % per year, not 6 %.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Real‑World Applications\n\n| Scenario | How compounding works |\n|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Savings account** | Bank credits interest monthly; your balance grows faster over time. |\n| **Mortgage** | Interest is added to the balance each month; the longer you keep the loan, the more you pay. |\n| **Retirement accounts (401(k), IRA)** | Contributions grow with compound interest; early and consistent investing yields huge gains. |\n| **Bonds** | Coupon payments can be reinvested, compounding the yield. |\n| **Business loans** | Interest accrues on the outstanding balance; paying down principal early reduces future interest. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Quick “Compound Interest” Cheat Sheet\n\n| Step | What to do |\n|------|------------|\n| 1 | Identify \\(P\\), \\(r\\), \\(n\\), \\(t\\). |\n| 2 | Plug into \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\). |\n| 3 | If you want EAR, use \\(\\text{EAR} = (1 + r/n)^n - 1\\). |\n| 4 | For continuous compounding, use \\(A = P e^{rt}\\). |\n| 5 | Compare different rates/frequencies to choose the best option. |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Quick Practice Problem\n\n**Problem:**  \nYou invest $5,000 at an annual nominal rate of 4 % compounded quarterly for 5 years. What is the final amount?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- \\(P = 5{,}000\\)\n- \\(r = 0.04\\)\n- \\(n = 4\\)\n- \\(t = 5\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 5{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5}\n  = 5{,}000 \\left(1 + 0.01\\right)^{20}\n  = 5{,}000 \\times 1.22019\n  \\approx \\$6{,}100.95\n\\]\n\nSo you’ll have about **$6,101** after 5 years.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nCompound interest turns your money into a “money‑machine” by letting the interest itself earn interest. The key variables are the rate, the compounding frequency, and the time horizon. The more often you compound and the longer you let it run, the greater the exponential growth.",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "## Hybridization – The “Mix‑and‑Match” of Atomic Orbitals\n\n### 1. What Is Hybridization?\n\nIn chemistry, **hybridization** is the *theoretical mixing* of two or more atomic orbitals (s, p, d, …) from the same atom to produce new, **hybrid orbitals** that are **equally oriented** and **equally energetic**.  \nThese hybrids are the orbitals that actually participate in covalent bonding, and they explain why molecules have the shapes they do.\n\n> **Key idea:**  \n> *Hybrid orbitals* are not real, separate orbitals that exist in isolation; they are a convenient mathematical construct that lets us predict and rationalize molecular geometry and bonding.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why Do We Need Hybridization?\n\n- **Molecular Geometry:**  \n  The VSEPR (Valence‑Shell Electron‑Pair Repulsion) model tells us that electron pairs (bonding or lone pairs) arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. Hybridization provides the *orbitals* that hold these pairs in the correct spatial arrangement.\n\n- **Bonding Directionality:**  \n  Pure s or p orbitals are spherical or dumb‑bell shaped, which would give bonds in random directions. Hybrid orbitals are *directional* (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal planar), matching the observed bond angles.\n\n- **Explaining Bond Strength & Length:**  \n  Hybrid orbitals have different s‑character. More s‑character → shorter, stronger bonds (e.g., C–H in sp³ vs. C≡C in sp).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. The Classic Hybridization Types\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals Combined | Geometry | Typical Bond Angles | Example Molecule |\n|---------------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|------------------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear | 180° | Ethyne (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar | 120° | Ethene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral | 109.5° | Methane (CH₄) |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° | PF₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral | 90° | SF₆ |\n\n> **Note:**  \n> The “d” orbitals are only used for elements in the third period or higher (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur). For second‑period elements, the “d” orbitals are too high in energy to participate, so the geometry is explained by *VSEPR* alone.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How Hybridization Works (A Simple Example)\n\n**Methane (CH₄)**  \n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons: 2 s¹ 2 p³.  \n- To form 4 equivalent C–H σ bonds, carbon mixes its 1 s and 3 p orbitals → **sp³ hybrids**.  \n- Each sp³ orbital points toward a corner of a tetrahedron (109.5°).  \n- The 4 C–H bonds are formed by overlap of each sp³ orbital with an H 1s orbital.\n\n**Result:**  \n- Tetrahedral shape, equal bond lengths, and the observed 109.5° angles.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hybridization vs. VSEPR\n\n| VSEPR | Hybridization |\n|-------|---------------|\n| Describes *electron pair* repulsion | Describes *orbital* mixing |\n| Predicts geometry | Explains why orbitals are oriented that way |\n| Empirical | Theoretical (quantum‑mechanical) |\n\nIn practice, chemists often use both: VSEPR for quick geometry predictions, hybridization for deeper insight into bonding.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Hybridization in Other Contexts (Quick Glossary)\n\n| Field | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Genetics** | Mixing of alleles from two parents (hybrid organisms). |\n| **Linguistics** | Combining words or morphemes from different languages (e.g., “Franglais”). |\n| **Ecology** | Hybrid species formed by interbreeding of two distinct species. |\n| **Computer Science** | Hybrid algorithms that combine two strategies (e.g., hybrid encryption). |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Common Misconceptions\n\n| Misconception | Reality |\n|---------------|---------|\n| “Hybrid orbitals are real orbitals.” | They are mathematical constructs; actual orbitals are the original s, p, d… |\n| “All molecules must be hybridized.” | For second‑period elements, pure p orbitals can explain geometry (e.g., O₂). |\n| “Hybridization explains bond angles perfectly.” | It works well for simple molecules; for more complex systems, advanced quantum‑chemical calculations are needed. |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Quick Recap\n\n- **Hybridization** = mixing of atomic orbitals → new, directionally oriented orbitals.  \n- **Purpose**: Explain molecular shapes, bond angles, and bond strengths.  \n- **Common types**: sp, sp², sp³, sp³d, sp³d².  \n- **Applications**: Chemistry, genetics, linguistics, ecology, computing (different meanings).  \n\nFeel free to ask for a deeper dive into any particular hybridization type or its quantum‑chemical basis!",

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": "**Alcohol is absorbed very quickly—usually within minutes of drinking.**  \nBelow is a practical, evidence‑based overview of how fast ethanol (the alcohol in beverages) enters the bloodstream, what factors influence that speed, and how the timing varies with different drinking scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Typical Absorption Timeline\n\n| Step | What Happens | Time to Peak (approx.) |\n|------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Ingestion** | Alcohol enters the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. | 0 min |\n| **Stomach absorption** | 20–30 % of a drink is absorbed in the stomach (especially when the stomach is empty). | 5–15 min |\n| **Small‑intestine absorption** | The bulk (≈ 70–80 %) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum. | 15–30 min |\n| **Peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC)** | Most people reach their peak BAC 30–90 min after starting to drink. | 30–90 min |\n| **Half‑life of elimination** | The body eliminates alcohol at ~0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour (≈ 0.1–0.2 g/L per hour). | 4–6 h (depends on metabolism) |\n\n> **Key point:**  \n> **90 % of the alcohol you drink is absorbed within the first 30–60 minutes.**  \n> The rest is absorbed more slowly or is metabolized in the liver before it can reach the bloodstream.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Factors That Speed Up or Slow Down Absorption\n\n| Factor | Effect on Absorption | Why |\n|--------|----------------------|-----|\n| **Empty stomach** | Faster | No food to slow gastric emptying. |\n| **Full stomach / high‑fat meal** | Slower | Food delays gastric emptying and reduces the fraction absorbed in the stomach. |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher concentration → faster peak | Spirits (40 % ABV) reach peak BAC faster than beer (5 %) or wine (12 %). |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Lower weight → faster rise | Less blood volume means a given amount of alcohol produces a higher BAC. |\n| **Gender** | Women → faster rise | Typically lower body water and higher alcohol dehydrogenase activity. |\n| **Metabolic rate** | Faster metabolism → lower peak | Genetic variations in ADH and ALDH enzymes. |\n| **Temperature** | Warmer → slightly faster | Blood flow increases, but effect is minor. |\n| **Alcohol type** | Spirits → faster | Less water content, higher ethanol concentration. |\n| **Drinking rate** | Rapid consumption → higher peak | Less time for the body to metabolize between sips. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Different Beverages Compare\n\n| Beverage | Typical ABV | Approx. time to peak BAC | Notes |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| **Beer (5 % ABV)** | 5 % | 45–60 min | Lower concentration → slower rise. |\n| **Wine (12 % ABV)** | 12 % | 30–45 min | Moderate concentration. |\n| **Spirits (40 % ABV)** | 40 % | 20–30 min | Highest concentration → fastest rise. |\n| **Mixed drinks** | Variable | Depends on ABV and volume | Often contain sugar, which can slow absorption slightly. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Special Routes of Administration\n\n| Route | Absorption Speed | Typical Peak Time | Practical Use |\n|-------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Oral (drinking)** | Fast (see above) | 30–90 min | Standard consumption. |\n| **Intravenous (IV)** | Immediate | 0 min | Medical settings, e.g., alcohol poisoning treatment. |\n| **Inhalation (smoking, vaping)** | Very fast | < 5 min | Rapid onset; used in some illicit contexts. |\n| **Transdermal (patches)** | Slow | 1–2 h | Experimental; not common for alcohol. |\n| **Mouth‑wash / oral sprays** | Very fast | < 5 min | Used for oral hygiene, not for intoxication. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical Take‑aways\n\n1. **Peak BAC is usually reached 30–90 minutes after you start drinking.**  \n   - If you’re planning to drive or operate machinery, wait at least 2–3 hours after your last drink to be safe.\n\n2. **An empty stomach speeds up absorption.**  \n   - If you’re going out, consider eating a protein‑rich snack to slow the rise.\n\n3. **Spirits reach peak BAC faster than beer or wine.**  \n   - A single shot of vodka (≈ 1.5 oz) can raise BAC in 20–30 min, whereas a pint of beer takes longer.\n\n4. **Individual differences matter.**  \n   - Women, people with lower body weight, or those with slower metabolism will feel the effects sooner.\n\n5. **The body eliminates alcohol at a fairly constant rate (~0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour).**  \n   - This means that after the peak, BAC falls linearly, but the exact time to return to zero depends on how much you drank.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference Chart\n\n| Time after drinking | Typical BAC (average adult) | What you might feel |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| 0–15 min | 0–0.02 % | Slight buzz, no impairment |\n| 15–30 min | 0.02–0.05 % | Mild euphoria, relaxed |\n| 30–60 min | 0.05–0.10 % | Slowed judgment, impaired coordination |\n| 60–120 min | 0.10–0.20 % | Noticeable impairment, risk of accidents |\n| 120–180 min | 0.20–0.30 % | Significant impairment, possible blackouts |\n| 180+ min | 0.30 %+ | Severe impairment, risk of alcohol poisoning |\n\n> **Remember:** These numbers are averages. Your own BAC curve can differ based on the factors listed above.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom Line\n\n- **Alcohol is absorbed rapidly—most of it within the first hour.**  \n- **Peak blood alcohol concentration typically occurs 30–90 minutes after starting to drink.**  \n- **Factors such as food, body weight, gender, and beverage type can shift that window.**  \n\nIf you’re ever unsure about how long it takes for alcohol to affect you, the safest rule is to give yourself at least **2–3 hours** after your last drink before engaging in activities that require full alertness.",

      "question": "What is strep throat ?",
      "system_answer": "**Strep throat** is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused almost exclusively by the bacterium *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A β‑hemolytic streptococcus). It is one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adolescents, but adults can get it too.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How it happens\n\n| Step | What occurs |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Exposure** | You inhale or touch droplets from an infected person. |\n| **Colonization** | The bacteria attach to the tonsillar or pharyngeal mucosa. |\n| **Invasion** | They produce toxins and enzymes that damage tissue and trigger inflammation. |\n| **Immune response** | The body releases white blood cells and antibodies, producing the classic sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Sore throat** | Sudden, severe pain, often worse when swallowing. |\n| **Fever** | Usually > 38 °C (100.4 °F). |\n| **Red, swollen tonsils** | May have white or yellow patches (exudates). |\n| **Tender cervical lymph nodes** | Swollen, painful lymph nodes in the neck. |\n| **Headache, body aches** | Common. |\n| **Nausea or vomiting** | Especially in children. |\n| **No cough or runny nose** | Helps differentiate from viral pharyngitis. |\n\n> **Red flag:** If you notice a sudden, severe sore throat with fever and no cough, consider strep throat and seek medical evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n| Method | What it shows |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)** | Detects streptococcal antigens in a throat swab; results in 5–15 min. |\n| **Throat culture** | Gold standard; confirms the presence of *S. pyogenes* and checks for antibiotic resistance. |\n| **Clinical scoring systems** (e.g., Centor or McIsaac) | Combine symptoms to estimate probability of strep. |\n\n> **Why a culture?** If the RADT is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, a culture is done because false negatives can occur.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Treatment | Details |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Antibiotics** | Penicillin or amoxicillin are first‑line; alternatives include cephalosporins, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) for penicillin‑allergic patients. |\n| **Duration** | 10 days of antibiotics (or 5 days of a macrolide). |\n| **Symptom relief** | Analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen), throat lozenges, warm salt‑water gargles. |\n| **When to stop** | Complete the full course even if symptoms improve; stopping early can lead to relapse or complications. |\n\n**Why antibiotics?** They reduce the risk of complications (e.g., rheumatic fever, peritonsillar abscess) and shorten the contagious period.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n| Strategy | How it helps |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Hand hygiene** | Wash hands with soap for 20 s, especially after coughing or sneezing. |\n| **Respiratory etiquette** | Cover mouth/nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing/sneezing. |\n| **Avoid close contact** | Stay away from infected individuals when possible. |\n| **Vaccination** | No vaccine for strep throat yet, but keeping up with routine vaccines (e.g., influenza) reduces overall respiratory infections. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Complications (rare but serious)\n\n| Complication | What it is |\n|--------------|------------|\n| **Rheumatic fever** | Autoimmune reaction that can damage heart valves. |\n| **Post‑streptococcal glomerulonephritis** | Kidney inflammation. |\n| **Peritonsillar abscess** | Pus collection near tonsils. |\n| **Sepsis** | Systemic infection (very rare). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial infection that causes a sudden, painful sore throat and fever. It is diagnosed with a throat swab test and treated with a 10‑day course of antibiotics. Early treatment prevents complications and reduces how long you can spread the infection. If you suspect strep throat, see a healthcare provider for testing and appropriate therapy.",

It is caused by the **polio virus (PV)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family, genus *Enterovirus*.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Virus\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Structure** | Small, non‑enveloped, single‑stranded RNA virus (~27 kb). |\n| **Serotypes** | Three: PV‑1, PV‑2, PV‑3 (historically). PV‑4 was identified in 2015 but is rare. |\n| **Transmission** | Fecal‑oral route (contaminated food/water, person‑to‑person). Rarely, respiratory droplets. |\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (range 3–35 days). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clinical Course\n\n| Stage | What happens |\n|-------|--------------|\n| **Incubation** | Virus replicates in the oropharynx and gut. |\n| **Prodromal (pre‑paralytic)** | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild GI symptoms. |\n| **Paralytic polio** | 1–5 % of infections become paralytic. Virus invades the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord → flaccid paralysis. |\n| **Post‑polio syndrome** | Years after recovery, patients may experience new weakness, fatigue, pain. |\n\n### Paralysis patterns\n\n| Pattern | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)** | Sudden onset, symmetrical, often lower limbs first. |\n| **Bulbar polio** | Involvement of cranial nerves → difficulty swallowing, breathing. |\n| **Upper motor neuron involvement** | Rare; can cause spasticity. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Viral isolation** | From stool or throat swab (culture in cell lines). |\n| **PCR** | Detects viral RNA; highly sensitive. |\n| **Serology** | Detects anti‑polio IgM (acute) or IgG (past exposure). |\n| **CSF analysis** | Elevated protein, normal cell count in paralytic cases. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Approach | Details |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Supportive care** | Hydration, pain control, physiotherapy. |\n| **Respiratory support** | Mechanical ventilation for bulbar paralysis. |\n| **No antiviral** | No specific drug; care focuses on preventing complications. |\n| **Rehabilitation** | Physical therapy, occupational therapy, assistive devices. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention\n\n| Method | How it works |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). |\n| **IPV** | Single dose (or series) of killed virus; safe, no risk of vaccine‑derived polio. |\n| **OPV** | Live attenuated virus; inexpensive, induces gut immunity; risk of very rare vaccine‑derived polio (VDPV). |\n| **Hygiene** | Handwashing, safe water, sanitation. |\n| **Surveillance** | AFP surveillance to detect outbreaks early. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Global Eradication Effort\n\n| Milestone | Year |\n|-----------|------|\n| WHO launches Polio Eradication Initiative | 1988 |\n| Global polio cases drop 99.9 % | 2019 |\n| Last wild‑type PV‑3 case | 2013 |\n| Last wild‑type PV‑2 case | 2016 |\n| Last wild‑type PV‑1 case | 2020 (in Afghanistan & Pakistan) |\n| Current focus | OPV cessation, IPV use, outbreak response, surveillance. |\n\n> **Why OPV is phased out?** OPV can, in rare cases, mutate back to a neurovirulent form (VDPV). Switching to IPV eliminates this risk while maintaining high immunity.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Polio is a viral disease** that can cause irreversible paralysis.\n2. **Transmission is fecal‑oral**; good sanitation and vaccination are critical.\n3. **Vaccination is 100 % effective** at preventing paralytic disease when coverage is high.\n4. **Global eradication is near**; the last wild cases were in 2019–2020, but vigilance remains essential.\n\nIf you have concerns about polio exposure or vaccination status, consult a healthcare provider or local public‑health authority.",

The outer core (liquid) is slightly cooler, around **4 500 – 5 000 °C**.\n\n---\n\n### Key points\n\n| Aspect | Detail |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Core composition** | Mostly iron (≈ 85 %) with nickel and light elements (S, Si, O, C). |\n| **Inner core** | Solid, radius ≈ 1 220 km, temperature high enough to keep iron in a solid state despite the pressure (~ 3.5 million bar). |\n| **Outer core** | Liquid, drives the geodynamo that generates Earth’s magnetic field. |\n| **Heat sources** | Residual heat from Earth’s formation, radioactive decay (U, Th, K) in the mantle, and ongoing crystallization of the inner core. |\n| **Heat flow** | About 0.08 W m⁻² at the core‑mantle boundary, implying a core temperature that is roughly 1.5–2 × the melting temperature of iron at that pressure. |\n\n---\n\n### Why the exact number matters\n\n- **Geodynamo**: The temperature gradient drives convection in the liquid outer core, sustaining Earth’s magnetic field.\n- **Core‑mantle interaction**: Heat transfer across the core‑mantle boundary influences mantle convection patterns and plate tectonics.\n- **Planetary evolution**: Knowing the core temperature helps model how Earth cooled over billions of years and how other terrestrial planets might behave.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nWhile we cannot measure the core directly, the convergence of seismic, experimental, and theoretical studies gives us a fairly precise estimate: **the center of the Earth is about 5 500 – 6 000 °C**. This is roughly the temperature of the surface of the Sun’s photosphere, but under far greater pressure, keeping iron solid.",

(≈ 230 mm)** | The state’s overall average is the lowest of any U.S. state.  Much of Nevada is part of the Mojave, Great Basin, and Great Basin Desert, where evaporation exceeds precipitation. |\n| **Wyoming** | **≈ 12 in. (≈ 300 mm)** | Often cited as the second‑driest state, but still higher than Nevada. |\n| **Arizona** | **≈ 13 in. (≈ 330 mm)** | The lowest‑average‑rainfall state in the Southwest, but still above Nevada. |\n\n### Why Nevada is the driest\n\n1. **Geography** – The state lies largely in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range, which block moist Pacific air from reaching the interior.\n2. **High elevation** – Much of Nevada is at elevations above 5,000 ft, where temperatures are cooler and the air holds less moisture.\n3. **Arid climate** – The Great Basin Desert dominates the landscape, producing very low precipitation and high evaporation rates.\n\n### Quick comparison\n\n- **California** (average ~20 in.) – much wetter, especially along the coast.\n- **Colorado** (average ~15 in.) – higher precipitation due to the Rocky Mountains.\n- **Texas** (average ~28 in.) – far wetter, especially in the Gulf Coast region.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for the state with the least rainfall, Nevada tops the list.",

      "system_answer": "**The Statue of Liberty is a composite structure made of several materials, each chosen for its specific properties:**\n\n| Layer / Component | Material | Purpose / Key Details |\n|-------------------|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Exterior skin (the “cladding”)** | **Copper** (≈ 6 tons) | Gives the statue its iconic green patina (verdigris) through natural oxidation. Copper is lightweight, malleable, and corrosion‑resistant. |\n| **Internal skeleton (support framework)** | **Iron** (originally) → **Steel** (replaced in 1904) | The original iron armature was replaced by a stronger, more corrosion‑resistant steel skeleton to support the copper skin and withstand wind loads. |\n| **Structural core (central support)** | **Steel** | The central “spine” and armature are made of steel to provide the necessary strength and stability. |\n| **Foundation** | **Concrete** (with steel reinforcement) | Anchors the statue to the pedestal and provides a stable base. |\n| **Pedestal** | **Granite** (from Vermont) | The pedestal is a 154‑ft‑high granite column that supports the statue. |\n| **Other elements** | **Bronze** (for the torch, crown, and other decorative details) | Bronze is used for smaller ornamental parts because of its durability and ease of casting. |\n\n### How it all fits together\n\n1. **Copper skin**: The outermost layer is a thin sheet of copper (about 1.5 mm thick) hammered into the shape of the statue’s surface.  \n2. **Iron/Steel armature**: Inside the copper skin is a lattice of iron (later replaced by steel) that forms the skeleton. This armature supports the weight of the copper and keeps the statue rigid.  \n3. **Steel core**: The central column of the statue is a steel shaft that runs from the base to the crown, providing the main structural backbone.  \n4. **Granite pedestal**: The statue sits on a 154‑ft granite pedestal that was built by the French and later reinforced with concrete and steel.  \n\n### Why these materials?\n\n- **Copper**: Light, workable, and develops a protective green patina that prevents further corrosion.  \n- **Steel**: Stronger and more corrosion‑resistant than iron, essential for long‑term structural integrity.  \n- **Granite**: Durable, weather‑resistant, and visually imposing.  \n- **Bronze**: Ideal for detailed casting of small ornamental features.\n\nSo, the Statue of Liberty is essentially a **copper‑clad, steel‑supported monument perched on a granite pedestal**—a brilliant example of 19th‑century engineering and artistry.",

      "question": "What is solar wind ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona) into interplanetary space. It is a fundamental component of the heliosphere, the bubble of solar influence that surrounds the entire Solar System.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How It Forms\n\n| Step | Process | Key Points |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| **1. Coronal heating** | The Sun’s outer atmosphere (corona) is heated to 1–3 million K, far hotter than the surface (≈ 5,800 K). | Exact heating mechanism is still debated (wave heating, magnetic reconnection). |\n| **2. Pressure gradient** | Hot, ionized gas expands outward because of the steep temperature gradient. | Creates a pressure gradient that pushes plasma away. |\n| **3. Magnetic field lines** | The Sun’s magnetic field guides the plasma along open field lines. | Open field lines allow particles to escape; closed loops trap plasma. |\n| **4. Escape velocity** | The thermal speed of ions exceeds the Sun’s escape velocity (~618 km s⁻¹) in the corona. | Particles accelerate to several hundred km s⁻¹. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Composition & Properties\n\n| Property | Typical Value | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Density** | ~5–10 particles cm⁻³ at 1 AU | Decreases roughly as 1/r². |\n| **Velocity** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ | “Fast” wind (~600 km s⁻¹) from coronal holes; “slow” wind (~300–400 km s⁻¹) from near the equator. |\n| **Temperature** | 1–3 million K (protons), ~10⁶ K (electrons) | Protons are hotter than electrons. |\n| **Magnetic field** | ~5 nT at 1 AU | Embedded in the plasma; forms the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). |\n| **Composition** | ~95 % protons, ~4 % alpha particles (He²⁺), ~1 % heavier ions (C, N, O, Fe, etc.) | Trace amounts of neutral atoms and dust. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Variability\n\n| Driver | Effect on Solar Wind |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Solar cycle (≈ 11 yr)** | Solar activity peaks → more coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and higher average wind speed. |\n| **Coronal holes** | Persistent, open magnetic regions → produce fast wind streams. |\n| **CMEs** | Sudden, massive ejections of plasma and magnetic field → can compress the heliosphere and trigger geomagnetic storms. |\n| **Solar flares** | Accelerate particles, but the bulk of the wind remains the same. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Interaction with the Heliosphere\n\n1. **Heliospheric Boundary**  \n   - Solar wind pushes against the interstellar medium, creating the **heliopause** (≈ 120 AU from the Sun).  \n   - Inside the heliopause, the solar wind is supersonic; beyond it, it slows to subsonic speeds.\n\n2. **Bow Shock**  \n   - The Sun’s motion through the local interstellar medium creates a bow shock ahead of the heliopause (though its existence is debated).\n\n3. **Magnetosphere Interaction**  \n   - When the solar wind reaches Earth, it interacts with the magnetosphere, causing auroras, magnetospheric substorms, and geomagnetic storms.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Measurement & Observation\n\n| Instrument / Mission | What it Measures |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| **ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer)** | Solar wind speed, density, temperature, composition, IMF. |\n| **Wind** | Same as ACE, plus high‑time‑resolution plasma data. |\n| **Parker Solar Probe** | Directly samples the solar wind close to the Sun (down to 0.1 AU). |\n| **Solar Orbiter** | Combines in‑situ plasma measurements with remote sensing of the corona. |\n| **Ground‑based magnetometers** | Detect geomagnetic effects of solar wind variations. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Why It Matters\n\n| Impact | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Space weather** | Solar wind variations drive geomagnetic storms that can damage satellites, power grids, and communication systems. |\n| **Planetary atmospheres** | Solar wind erosion shapes the atmospheres of Mars and Venus; it also influences the magnetospheres of other planets. |\n| **Heliospheric physics** | Understanding the solar wind helps us learn about plasma physics, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence. |\n| **Astrobiology** | Solar wind fluxes affect surface radiation environments on planets and moons. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\n- **Solar wind** = a hot, ionized plasma stream flowing outward from the Sun at hundreds of km s⁻¹.  \n- It is driven by coronal heating and guided by the Sun’s magnetic field.  \n- It shapes the heliosphere, interacts with planetary magnetospheres, and drives space weather.  \n- Continuous monitoring (ACE, Wind, Parker Solar Probe, etc.) is essential for both scientific understanding and practical applications.",

How to Negotiate Severance\n\n1. **Review the offer** – Check the amount, benefit extensions, and any conditions (e.g., non‑disparagement clauses).  \n2. **Know your rights** – Understand applicable laws and any contractual obligations.  \n3. **Ask for clarity** – Request written documentation of the severance terms.  \n4. **Consider tax implications** – Consult a tax professional if the package is large.  \n5. **Seek legal advice** – Especially if you suspect discrimination or wrongful termination.  \n\n---\n\n### 6.  Key Takeaway\n\nSeverance pay is a negotiated or statutory payment that eases the financial impact of job loss. While the specifics vary by company, industry, and jurisdiction, the core purpose is to provide a safety net for employees during a transition period.",

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": "### Semiconductors – The “Middle‑Ground” of Electricity\n\n| Aspect | What it Means |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Definition** | Materials whose electrical conductivity lies between that of conductors (e.g., copper) and insulators (e.g., glass). |\n| **Key Property** | Conductivity can be **controlled** by adding impurities (doping) or by applying voltage, temperature, light, etc. |\n| **Common Materials** | Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Silicon Carbide (SiC), and many others. |\n| **Why It Matters** | Enables the creation of electronic devices that can **switch**, **amplify**, and **process** signals—everything from smartphones to solar panels. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How Semiconductors Work\n\n1. **Crystal Structure**  \n   - In a pure semiconductor, electrons are tightly bound to atoms.  \n   - At room temperature, only a few electrons have enough energy to jump into the “conduction band” and move freely.\n\n2. **Doping (Adding Impurities)**  \n   - **n‑type**: Add atoms with **extra valence electrons** (e.g., phosphorus in silicon). These extra electrons become mobile carriers.  \n   - **p‑type**: Add atoms with **missing valence electrons** (e.g., boron in silicon). This creates “holes” that act as positive charge carriers.\n\n3. **p‑n Junction**  \n   - When n‑type and p‑type regions are joined, a **depletion zone** forms.  \n   - This junction behaves like a diode: it allows current to flow in one direction but blocks it in the other.\n\n4. **Control Mechanisms**  \n   - **Voltage**: Forward bias reduces the barrier, allowing current; reverse bias increases it, blocking current.  \n   - **Temperature**: Higher temperatures give electrons more energy to cross the band gap.  \n   - **Light**: Photons can excite electrons, creating photo‑current (used in solar cells).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Types of Semiconductor Devices\n\n| Device | Basic Principle | Typical Use |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction that allows current one way | Rectifiers, signal detectors |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Uses a small input to control a larger current | Amplifiers, switches, logic gates |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Many transistors and other components on a single chip | CPUs, memory, sensors |\n| **Photodiode / Solar Cell** | Converts light into electricity | Cameras, solar panels |\n| **LED** | Emits light when electrons recombine with holes | Displays, indicators |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why Silicon Is the King\n\n| Reason | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Abundance** | Silicon is the 2nd most abundant element in Earth’s crust. |\n| **Band Gap** | ~1.1 eV – ideal for room‑temperature electronics. |\n| **Oxide Layer** | SiO₂ forms a perfect, stable insulating layer, essential for MOSFETs. |\n| **Mature Fabrication** | Decades of research and billions of dollars invested in silicon fabs. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Emerging Semiconductor Materials\n\n| Material | Advantage | Typical Application |\n|----------|-----------|---------------------|\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | Wide band gap, high breakdown voltage | Power electronics, RF amplifiers |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | High temperature, high power | Electric‑vehicle chargers, industrial drives |\n| **Graphene** | Extremely high carrier mobility | Flexible electronics, high‑speed transistors |\n| **Perovskites** | Low‑cost, high‑efficiency solar cells | Photovoltaics |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom Line\n\nSemiconductors are the **engine** of modern electronics. By precisely controlling how electrons move through a material, engineers can build devices that switch, amplify, and process information—making everything from a pocket‑sized phone to a satellite possible.",
