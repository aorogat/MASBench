      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate (THR)** is the heart‑rate range you aim to stay within during aerobic exercise so that you get the most benefit for your fitness level and health goals while staying safe.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Target Heart Rate Matters\n\n| Goal | Typical THR Zone | Why It Helps |\n|------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Weight loss / calorie burn** | 70 – 85 % of maximum heart rate (MHR) | Higher intensity burns more calories per minute. |\n| **Cardiovascular fitness** | 50 – 70 % of MHR | Improves heart‑lung efficiency without excessive strain. |\n| **Endurance training** | 60 – 80 % of MHR | Builds stamina for longer sessions. |\n| **Rehabilitation / low‑impact** | 50 – 60 % of MHR | Safe for people with joint issues or heart conditions. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to Calculate Your Target Heart Rate\n\n### Step 1 – Estimate Your Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)\n\nThe classic formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MHR} = 220 - \\text{age}\n\\]\n\n**Example:** 35‑year‑old → 220 – 35 = 185 bpm.\n\n*Note:* This is a rough estimate. Some people use more precise formulas (e.g., Tanaka, Gellish) or a lab test.\n\n### Step 2 – Pick Your Intensity Zone\n\n| Intensity | % of MHR | Typical Activity |\n|-----------|----------|------------------|\n| Light | 50 – 60 % | Walking, gentle cycling |\n| Moderate | 60 – 70 % | Brisk walking, easy jogging |\n| Hard | 70 – 85 % | Running, vigorous cycling |\n| Very Hard | 85 – 95 % | Sprinting, high‑intensity interval training (HIIT) |\n\n### Step 3 – Calculate the Range\n\n\\[\n\\text{Lower bound} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{lower %}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Upper bound} = \\text{MHR} \\times \\text{upper %}\n\\]\n\n**Example (35‑year‑old, moderate zone):**\n\n- Lower = 185 × 0.60 = 111 bpm  \n- Upper = 185 × 0.70 = 129 bpm  \n\nSo aim for 111–129 bpm while jogging.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Monitor Your Heart Rate\n\n| Method | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| **Manual pulse** (wrist or neck) | Free | Requires stopping to count |\n| **Chest strap** | Accurate, real‑time | Needs a compatible watch or phone |\n| **Smartwatch / fitness tracker** | Convenient, shows trend | Accuracy varies; battery life |\n| **Heart‑rate monitor app** (phone + sensor) | Easy to use | Needs a sensor attachment |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Tips\n\n1. **Warm‑up & Cool‑down** – Start below your target zone, gradually climb, and finish below it.  \n2. **Use the “talk test”** – If you can talk comfortably, you’re likely in the moderate zone; if you can only speak a few words, you’re in the hard zone.  \n3. **Adjust for fitness level** – If you’re new, start at the lower end of the moderate zone and progress.  \n4. **Check for medical conditions** – People with heart disease, hypertension, or on certain medications should consult a healthcare provider before using THR.  \n5. **Track trends** – Over weeks, a steady rise in the same zone indicates improved fitness.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| “Higher heart rate always means better workout.” | Not necessarily; over‑exertion can lead to injury and burnout. |\n| “220‑age is always accurate.” | It’s a general rule; individual variation can be ±10 bpm or more. |\n| “You must stay exactly in the zone.” | Small fluctuations are fine; focus on overall trend. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference Table\n\n| Age | MHR (bpm) | 50–60 % | 60–70 % | 70–85 % | 85–95 % |\n|-----|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 20 | 200 | 100–120 | 120–140 | 140–170 | 170–190 |\n| 30 | 190 | 95–114 | 114–133 | 133–161 | 161–181 |\n| 40 | 180 | 90–108 | 108–126 | 126–153 | 153–171 |\n| 50 | 170 | 85–102 | 102–119 | 119–144 | 144–161 |\n| 60 | 160 | 80–96 | 96–112 | 112–136 | 136–152 |\n\n*(Rounded to nearest whole number.)*\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Target heart rate is a simple, science‑backed tool that helps you exercise at the right intensity for your goals, keeping you safe and effective. Use it as a guide, not a hard rule, and pair it with other fitness indicators (distance, speed, perceived exertion) for a balanced training plan.",

      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are the biological catalysts that make life possible.  \nThey are proteins (or, in a few cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in cells by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  Core Characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Catalytic** | They speed up reactions without being consumed. |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme recognizes a particular substrate (or a small set of substrates) and a specific reaction. |\n| **Regulated** | Enzyme activity is controlled by the cell through mechanisms such as allosteric regulation, covalent modification, and gene expression. |\n| **Structure‑function relationship** | The 3‑D shape of an enzyme (its active site) determines which substrates it can bind and what reaction it can catalyze. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How Enzymes Work\n\n1. **Substrate Binding** – The substrate(s) fit into the enzyme’s active site, forming an **enzyme‑substrate complex**.  \n2. **Transition State Stabilization** – The enzyme lowers the activation energy by stabilizing the transition state.  \n3. **Product Formation** – The reaction proceeds, producing product(s).  \n4. **Release** – Products leave, and the enzyme is ready for another round.\n\n*Illustration:*  \n```\nEnzyme + Substrate ⇌ Enzyme–Substrate Complex → Enzyme + Product\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Classification\n\n| Class | Reaction Type | Example |\n|-------|---------------|---------|\n| **Oxidoreductases** | Redox reactions | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| **Transferases** | Transfer functional groups | Alanine transaminase |\n| **Hydrolases** | Hydrolysis (water addition) | Amylase, protease |\n| **Lyases** | Addition or removal of groups without hydrolysis | Decarboxylases |\n| **Isomerases** | Rearrangement of atoms within a molecule | Phosphoglucose isomerase |\n| **Ligases** | Joining two molecules with ATP | DNA ligase |\n\nThe Enzyme Commission (EC) number system gives each enzyme a unique 4‑part identifier (e.g., EC 2.7.1.1 for hexokinase).\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Biological Roles\n\n| Process | Enzyme Example | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Digestion** | Pepsin, trypsin, lipase | Breaks food into absorbable units |\n| **Metabolism** | Hexokinase, citrate synthase | Drives glycolysis, TCA cycle |\n| **DNA/RNA** | DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, ligase | Replication, transcription |\n| **Protein synthesis** | Aminoacyl‑tRNA synthetase | Charges tRNA with amino acids |\n| **Signal transduction** | Protein kinases, phosphatases | Modulates cellular responses |\n| **Immune defense** | Lysozyme, complement proteins | Protects against pathogens |\n| **Detoxification** | Cytochrome P450 | Metabolizes drugs and toxins |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Enzyme Regulation\n\n| Mechanism | How it works |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| **Allosteric regulation** | Effector molecules bind sites other than the active site, changing enzyme activity. |\n| **Covalent modification** | Phosphorylation, acetylation, etc., alter enzyme activity. |\n| **Gene expression** | Cells produce more or fewer enzyme molecules in response to signals. |\n| **Feedback inhibition** | End products of a pathway inhibit an upstream enzyme. |\n| **Proteolytic activation** | Zymogens (inactive precursors) are cleaved to become active enzymes. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Enzymes in Industry & Medicine\n\n| Field | Enzyme Use | Example |\n|-------|------------|---------|\n| **Food & Beverage** | Fermentation, flavor development | Lactase (lactose‑free milk), amylase (bread dough) |\n| **Detergents** | Stain removal | Protease, lipase |\n| **Pharmaceuticals** | Drug synthesis, diagnostics | Alkaline phosphatase (biomarker) |\n| **Biofuels** | Cellulose breakdown | Cellulase |\n| **Bioremediation** | Degradation of pollutants | Peroxidase |\n| **Biotechnology** | DNA sequencing, PCR | Taq polymerase |\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Key Take‑Away\n\n- **Enzymes are proteins (or RNA) that catalyze specific biochemical reactions.**  \n- They are essential for metabolism, growth, repair, and regulation in all living organisms.  \n- Their activity is finely tuned by the cell, ensuring that reactions occur at the right time, place, and rate.  \n- Because of their specificity and efficiency, enzymes are invaluable tools in medicine, industry, and research.\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like deeper details on a particular enzyme, mechanism, or application!",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nThe Sun itself emits *white* light. It looks yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters the shorter (blue) wavelengths out of the direct line of sight, leaving a mixture that our eyes interpret as yellow.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the Sun actually emits\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| **Effective temperature** | ~5 800 K |\n| **Spectral type** | G2V |\n| **Color temperature** | ~5 500 K (≈ “white” or “warm‑white”) |\n| **Spectrum** | Continuous black‑body spectrum with absorption lines (Fraunhofer lines). |\n\nA black‑body at 5 800 K peaks in the visible, producing a balanced mix of red, green, and blue light. To the naked eye, that mix is perceived as *white*.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why we see yellow\n\n### Rayleigh scattering\n- **Mechanism:** Short‑wavelength light (blue, violet) is scattered by air molecules more strongly than long‑wavelength light (red, orange).\n- **Effect:** When sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the blue component is dispersed in many directions, while the red/green component continues straight toward the observer.\n- **Result:** The direct beam that reaches our eyes is depleted of blue light, giving it a yellowish hue.\n\n### Human eye response\n- The human eye has three cone types (S, M, L).  \n  - **S‑cones** (short wavelengths) are less stimulated by the scattered light that reaches the eye.  \n  - The combined stimulation of M‑ and L‑cones (green + red) is interpreted as yellow.\n\n### Atmospheric thickness\n- **At noon** (Sun high in the sky): the light path through the atmosphere is short → less scattering → the Sun appears whiter or slightly yellowish.\n- **At sunrise/sunset** (longer path): more scattering → the Sun appears red/orange.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Visual & cultural aspects\n\n| Context | Typical appearance |\n|---------|--------------------|\n| **Direct observation** | White to slightly yellow (depending on air clarity). |\n| **Photographs** | Often rendered in “warm” tones (yellow/orange) for aesthetic reasons. |\n| **Art & media** | The Sun is frequently depicted as yellow or orange to emphasize its brightness and warmth. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Summary\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| *What color is the Sun?* | White (spectrally). |\n| *Why does it look yellow?* | Atmospheric Rayleigh scattering removes blue light from the direct beam, leaving a yellow‑ish mix that our eyes interpret as yellow. |\n| *Does the Sun’s color change?* | Only in appearance due to atmospheric conditions; its intrinsic spectrum remains essentially constant. |\n\nSo, the Sun is not actually yellow—it’s the atmosphere that turns the white light we receive into the familiar yellow glow.",

It is caused by the **foot‑and‑mouth disease virus (FMDV)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Virus & Classification\n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Virus type** | Single‑stranded, positive‑sense RNA |\n| **Genus** | *Aphthovirus* |\n| **Serotypes** | Seven distinct serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, Asia‑1) – each requires its own vaccine strain. |\n| **Genome** | ~8,500 nucleotides, encoding 4 structural (VP1‑VP4) and 8 non‑structural proteins. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Affected Species\n\n| Species | Typical clinical signs |\n|---------|------------------------|\n| **Cattle** | Fever, lameness, vesicles on hooves, tongue, and mouth; reduced milk production. |\n| **Sheep & Goats** | Fever, lameness, vesicles on hooves, lips, and udder; high mortality in lambs. |\n| **Pigs** | Fever, lameness, vesicles on snout, lips, and hooves; high mortality in piglets. |\n| **Wild ruminants** (elk, deer, bison) | Vesicles, lameness; can act as reservoirs. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Transmission\n\n| Route | How it occurs |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **Direct contact** | Between infected and susceptible animals. |\n| **Indirect contact** | Contaminated feed, water, equipment, clothing, or vehicles. |\n| **Airborne** | Virus can travel up to several kilometers in fine droplets, especially in windy conditions. |\n| **Contaminated fomites** | Bedding, feed, and even soil can carry the virus for weeks. |\n| **Wildlife** | Certain species (e.g., deer, wild boar) can spread the virus over large distances. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Clinical Signs\n\n| Stage | Symptoms |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Incubation** | 2–14 days (average 4–7 days). |\n| **Early** | Fever (up to 41 °C), depression, loss of appetite. |\n| **Vesicular** | Small, fluid‑filled blisters on the tongue, lips, hooves, and teats. |\n| **Secondary** | Vesicles rupture → painful ulcers, lameness, decreased milk yield, reproductive failure. |\n| **Recovery** | Lesions heal in 10–14 days; animals become immune but may carry the virus in the udder or reproductive tract for weeks. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Diagnosis\n\n| Method | What it detects |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **Virus isolation** (cell culture) | Gold standard; confirms live virus. |\n| **RT‑PCR** | Detects viral RNA; rapid and highly sensitive. |\n| **Serology** (ELISA, virus neutralization) | Detects antibodies; useful for surveillance and post‑epidemic monitoring. |\n| **Rapid antigen tests** | Field‑ready kits for quick screening. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Economic & Public‑Health Impact\n\n| Impact | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Livestock industry** | Losses from mortality, reduced productivity, trade restrictions, and culling. |\n| **Trade** | Countries with FMD outbreaks face bans on export of meat, dairy, and live animals. |\n| **Human health** | No known zoonotic transmission; disease is not a threat to humans. |\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Prevention & Control\n\n| Strategy | Key points |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines; must match circulating serotype. |\n| **Movement restrictions** | Quarantine, controlled animal movement, and stamping‑out of infected herds. |\n| **Biosecurity** | Strict hygiene, disinfection of equipment, controlled access to farms. |\n| **Surveillance** | Routine testing of high‑risk areas, sentinel herds, and wildlife monitoring. |\n| **Culling** | In many countries, infected and exposed animals are slaughtered to stop spread. |\n| **International cooperation** | FAO, OIE, and national veterinary services coordinate outbreak responses. |\n\n---\n\n## 8.  Global Status\n\n- **Endemic** in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  \n- **Free** in the European Union, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but under strict surveillance.  \n- **Outbreaks** can spread rapidly; the 2001 UK outbreak and the 2010–2011 outbreaks in the Middle East are notable examples.\n\n---\n\n## 9.  Quick Facts\n\n| Fact | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| **Incubation period** | 2–14 days |\n| **Mortality** | 0–100 % (high in young animals) |\n| **Transmission distance** | Up to 5 km by air; longer via contaminated vehicles or wildlife. |\n| **Human risk** | None (non‑zoonotic) |\n| **Control cost** | Can reach millions of dollars per outbreak (vaccination, culling, trade loss). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a **highly contagious viral disease** that devastates livestock production worldwide.

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation And Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and map objects underwater (or in air, in some cases). Think of it as the underwater equivalent of radar, but instead of radio waves it uses sound.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How Sonar Works\n\n1. **Transmitter** emits a short burst of sound (a “ping”) into the water.  \n2. The sound travels outward until it hits an object or the sea floor.  \n3. The sound reflects (echoes) back toward the source.  \n4. **Receiver** (often the same transducer that sent the ping) picks up the echo.  \n5. By measuring the time between the ping and the echo, the system calculates distance (range).  \n6. The direction of the echo (angle) tells the system where the object is located.\n\n> **Speed of sound in water** ≈ 1,500 m/s (varies with temperature, salinity, depth).  \n> **Distance** = (time × speed)/2 (divide by 2 because the sound travels to the target and back).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | Purpose | Typical Use |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits pings and listens for echoes. | Submarine detection, fish finders, navigation, depth sounding. |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Only listens; no pings are emitted. | Detecting ships, submarines, marine life by their own sounds. |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Uses high‑frequency sound to create detailed images. | Underwater archaeology, pipeline inspection, marine biology. |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to image the seafloor. | Mapping seabed, locating wrecks, seabed mapping. |\n| **Multibeam Sonar** | Emits multiple beams to map large areas quickly. | Bathymetric mapping, hydrographic surveys. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Key Components\n\n| Component | Function |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Transducer** | Converts electrical signals to sound waves and vice versa. |\n| **Power Supply** | Drives the transducer. |\n| **Signal Processor** | Filters, amplifies, and interprets echo data. |\n| **Display/Interface** | Shows range, bearing, depth, or images to the operator. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Common Applications\n\n| Field | Example |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Naval & Military** | Submarine detection, mine hunting, navigation. |\n| **Commercial Shipping** | Collision avoidance, navigation in shallow waters. |\n| **Fishing** | Fish‑finder to locate schools of fish. |\n| **Marine Research** | Mapping ocean floor, studying marine life. |\n| **Oil & Gas** | Pipeline inspection, seabed mapping for drilling. |\n| **Search & Rescue** | Locating submerged objects or people. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Advantages & Limitations\n\n| Advantage | Limitation |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Works in darkness, murky water, and at any depth. | Sound absorption increases with frequency; high‑frequency sonar has limited range. |\n| Can detect objects that are invisible to the eye. | Echoes can be distorted by temperature layers (thermoclines). |\n| Passive sonar is stealthy (no pings). | Active sonar can reveal the user’s position to others. |\n| Provides depth and distance data. | Requires careful calibration; affected by sea state and salinity. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Fun Fact\n\n- The first practical sonar system was developed during World War I to detect submarines.  \n- Modern submarines use a combination of active and passive sonar to stay hidden while still knowing where other vessels are.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSonar is a powerful, versatile tool that lets us “see” underwater by listening to echoes of sound waves. Whether it’s a fisherman spotting a school of fish or a navy submarine navigating the deep, sonar turns invisible water into a map of sound.",

      "question": "What is fibromyalgia ?",
      "system_answer": "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and a range of other symptoms. It’s considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning the nervous system amplifies pain signals.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Core Features\n\n| Symptom | Typical Presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain in at least 4 of 5 body regions (above & below waist, left & right sides, neck/shoulders). |\n| **Fatigue** | Persistent tiredness that isn’t relieved by sleep. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Non‑restorative sleep, frequent awakenings, or difficulty falling asleep. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Trouble concentrating, memory lapses, “brain fog.” |\n| **Headaches** | Migraine‑like or tension‑type headaches. |\n| **Mood changes** | Anxiety, depression, irritability. |\n| **Other** | Irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, dizziness, numbness/tingling. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Diagnosis\n\n- **No single lab test**; diagnosis is clinical.\n- **American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (2010)**:  \n  1. Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥ 7 **and** symptom severity scale (SSS) ≥ 5, **or** WPI 5–6 **and** SSS ≥ 9.  \n  2. Symptoms present ≥ 3 months.  \n  3. No other disorder explains the pain.\n\n- **Exclusion of other conditions**: blood tests, imaging, and other evaluations to rule out infections, autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Causes & Risk Factors\n\n| Factor | How it may contribute |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| **Genetics** | Family history increases risk. |\n| **Trauma** | Physical injury, emotional stress, or major life events can trigger onset. |\n| **Infections** | Viral or bacterial infections may precipitate symptoms. |\n| **Sleep problems** | Poor sleep quality can worsen pain and fatigue. |\n| **Hormonal changes** | Women are 2–3 × more likely; hormonal fluctuations may play a role. |\n| **Central sensitization** | The nervous system becomes hypersensitive to pain signals. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Treatment Approaches\n\n| Category | Common Options |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Medications** | • **Pain relievers** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs) <br>• **Antidepressants** (duloxetine, milnacipran, amitriptyline) <br>• **Anticonvulsants** (gabapentin, pregabalin) |\n| **Lifestyle** | • Regular aerobic exercise (walking, swimming) <br>• Sleep hygiene (consistent bedtime, dark room) <br>• Stress‑management (mindfulness, CBT, yoga) |\n| **Physical therapy** | Structured exercise programs, stretching, manual therapy. |\n| **Complementary therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, tai chi, biofeedback. |\n| **Support** | Peer support groups, counseling, education. |\n\n> **Goal**: Reduce pain, improve sleep, increase function, and enhance quality of life.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Living with Fibromyalgia\n\n- **Track symptoms**: Keep a pain diary (pain level, triggers, sleep quality).  \n- **Set realistic goals**: Small, achievable steps in activity and self‑care.  \n- **Communicate**: Share your experience with healthcare providers, family, and friends.  \n- **Seek professional help**: A multidisciplinary team (rheumatologist, pain specialist, PT, psychologist) often yields the best outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Key Take‑aways\n\n- Fibromyalgia is a **real, chronic condition**—not “all in the head.”  \n- It involves **widespread pain, fatigue, and other systemic symptoms**.  \n- Diagnosis is based on **clinical criteria** and exclusion of other diseases.  \n- **Treatment is multimodal**: medication, exercise, sleep, stress management, and support.  \n- With a tailored plan, many people can manage symptoms and lead active lives.\n\n---\n\n**References** (for further reading)\n\n1.

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "## Compound Interest – The “Interest on Interest” Concept\n\n### 1. What Is Compound Interest?\n\nCompound interest is the interest you earn (or owe) on the **original principal plus all the interest that has already accumulated**.  \nIn other words, you earn interest on the interest that has been added to your account in previous periods.\n\n> **Key idea:** The longer the money stays invested (or borrowed), the more it “grows” because each new interest payment is calculated on a larger base.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Basic Formula\n\nFor a principal amount \\(P\\) invested at an annual nominal rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 5 % → 0.05) that is compounded \\(n\\) times per year for \\(t\\) years, the future value \\(A\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{n t}}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(P\\)** – Initial principal (the amount you start with).  \n- **\\(r\\)** – Nominal annual interest rate (not the effective rate).  \n- **\\(n\\)** – Number of compounding periods per year (e.g., 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly).  \n- **\\(t\\)** – Time in years.  \n- **\\(A\\)** – Amount after \\(t\\) years (principal + interest).\n\n---\n\n### 3. How It Works – A Step‑by‑Step Example\n\n**Scenario:**  \n- Principal \\(P = \\$1{,}000\\)  \n- Annual nominal rate \\(r = 6\\%\\) (0.06)  \n- Compounded monthly (\\(n = 12\\))  \n- Time \\(t = 3\\) years\n\n**Step 1 – Monthly rate:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{r}{n} = \\frac{0.06}{12} = 0.005 \\quad (0.5\\% \\text{ per month})\n\\]\n\n**Step 2 – Number of periods:**  \n\\[\nn t = 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3 – Apply the formula:**  \n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\times (1 + 0.005)^{36}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4 – Compute:**  \n\\[\nA \\approx 1{,}000 \\times 1.197 \\approx \\$1{,}197\n\\]\n\n**Result:** After 3 years, you’ll have about **\\$1,197** – an increase of **\\$197** purely from compounding.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Simple vs. Compound Interest\n\n| Feature | Simple Interest | Compound Interest |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Formula** | \\(A = P(1 + rt)\\) | \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\) |\n| **Interest base** | Only the original principal | Principal + all accumulated interest |\n| **Growth pattern** | Linear | Exponential |\n| **Typical use** | Short‑term loans, simple savings | Long‑term savings, investments, mortgages |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Compounding Frequency Matters\n\n| Frequency | Effective Annual Rate (EAR) for a nominal 6 % rate |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Annually (n=1) | 6.00 % |\n| Semi‑annually (n=2) | 6.09 % |\n| Quarterly (n=4) | 6.14 % |\n| Monthly (n=12) | 6.18 % |\n| Daily (n=365) | 6.20 % |\n\n> **Why it matters:** The more often interest is added, the higher the effective return (or cost).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Continuous Compounding\n\nWhen compounding occurs an infinite number of times per year, we use the limit:\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(e\\)** – Euler’s number (≈ 2.71828).  \n- **Interpretation:** The “continuous” formula gives the maximum theoretical growth for a given nominal rate.\n\n**Example:**  \n\\(P = \\$1{,}000\\), \\(r = 6\\%\\), \\(t = 3\\) years  \n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\times e^{0.06 \\times 3} \\approx 1{,}000 \\times 1.197 \\approx \\$1{,}197\n\\]\n(very close to the monthly compounding result).\n\n---\n\n### 7. Practical Applications\n\n| Situation | How Compound Interest Helps |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| **Savings accounts** | Earn more over time; higher compounding frequency (daily) boosts returns. |\n| **Retirement funds** | Long‑term growth; compounding turns modest contributions into substantial wealth. |\n| **Student loans** | Compounding increases the total amount owed if payments are delayed. |\n| **Mortgages** | Monthly compounding determines the exact interest paid over the life of the loan. |\n| **Business investments** | Reinvesting profits accelerates growth. |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Quick “What‑If” Calculator (Manual)\n\nIf you want to estimate compound interest without a calculator:\n\n1. **Convert the rate to a decimal** (e.g., 5 % → 0.05).  \n2. **Divide by the compounding frequency** to get the periodic rate.  \n3. **Add 1** to that periodic rate.  \n4. **Raise** the result to the power of (frequency × years).  \n5. **Multiply** by the principal.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Common Misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| “Compound interest is only for banks.” | It applies to any situation where interest is added to the principal (loans, bonds, savings, etc.). |\n| “More compounding periods always mean more interest.” | True, but the difference diminishes as you approach continuous compounding. |\n| “I can ignore compounding if I’m only investing for a short time.” | Even short periods can benefit from compounding, especially with higher rates or frequent compounding. |\n\n---\n\n### 10. Bottom Line\n\n- **Compound interest** turns your money into a “money‑making machine” by adding interest to the growing balance.  \n- The **formula** \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\) captures how the amount grows over time.  \n- **Frequency** matters: more frequent compounding → higher effective returns.  \n- **Continuous compounding** gives the theoretical upper bound.  \n\nUse these concepts to evaluate savings plans, loans, and investment opportunities, and you’ll see how powerful compounding can be over the long haul.",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "### Hybridization – The Chemistry View\n\n**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals (the “clouds” of electrons around an atom) mix to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of a molecule. It’s the reason why, for example, carbon in methane (CH₄) forms four *equally* strong bonds arranged tetrahedrally, even though the pure 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon are not all equivalent.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Why Hybridization Is Needed\n\n- **Molecular Geometry:** The shape of a molecule (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal planar, linear) is determined by the arrangement of electron pairs around the central atom.\n- **Bonding Symmetry:** Pure atomic orbitals (s, p, d) are not all the same size or orientation. Mixing them creates orbitals that are *spatially* equivalent, matching the observed geometry.\n- **Predicting Bond Angles:** Hybrid orbitals give the correct bond angles (e.g., 109.5° for tetrahedral, 120° for trigonal planar).\n\n---\n\n#### 2. The Basic Hybridization Types\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals Involved | Number of Hybrid Orbitals | Geometry | Example |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | 2 | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, CO₂ |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | 3 | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, C₃H₆ |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | 4 | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | 6 | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n> **Note:** The “d” orbitals are only used for atoms in the third period or higher (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. How Hybridization Works (Step‑by‑Step)\n\n1. **Identify the Central Atom’s Valence Orbitals**  \n   - Count the number of *sigma* bonds and lone pairs around the atom.  \n   - This number equals the number of hybrid orbitals needed.\n\n2. **Mix the Appropriate Orbitals**  \n   - Combine one s orbital with the required number of p (and possibly d) orbitals.  \n   - The resulting hybrid orbitals are *equivalent* in energy and shape.\n\n3. **Form Bonds**  \n   - Each hybrid orbital overlaps with a lone pair or orbital from a neighboring atom to form a σ‑bond.\n\n4. **Determine Geometry**  \n   - The spatial arrangement of the hybrid orbitals dictates the molecular shape.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- **Carbon’s valence orbitals:** 2s¹ 2p³  \n- **Number of bonds:** 4 (to four H atoms)  \n- **Hybridization:** sp³ (1 s + 3 p → 4 hybrids)  \n- **Resulting geometry:** Tetrahedral, 109.5° bond angles.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Hybridization vs. Electron‑Pair Geometry\n\n- **Hybridization** is a *model* that explains bonding.  \n- **VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion)** predicts geometry based on electron‑pair repulsion.  \n- In most simple molecules, the two approaches give the same geometry, but hybridization provides a deeper insight into the nature of the bonds.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Beyond Chemistry\n\nWhile “hybridization” is most commonly used in chemistry, the term appears in other fields:\n\n| Field | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Genetics** | Mixing of genes from two parents to produce offspring. |\n| **Ecology** | Interbreeding between species or subspecies. |\n| **Linguistics** | Mixing of two languages or dialects to create a new form. |\n| **Technology** | Combining two systems or technologies (e.g., hybrid cars). |\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Quick Reference Cheat‑Sheet\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals | Hybrid Orbitals | Geometry | Bond Angle |\n|---------------|----------|-----------------|----------|------------|\n| sp | 1 s + 1 p | 2 | Linear | 180° |\n| sp² | 1 s + 2 p | 3 | Trigonal planar | 120° |\n| sp³ | 1 s + 3 p | 4 | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| sp³d | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n| sp³d² | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | 6 | Octahedral | 90° |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nHybridization is a useful conceptual tool that explains why atoms form bonds in specific geometries. By mixing s, p, and sometimes d orbitals, atoms create equivalent hybrid orbitals that lead to the observed shapes and bond angles of molecules.",

How fast does it get into the blood?\n\n- **Initial rise:** Within the first 5–10 minutes you’ll see a measurable increase in blood‑ethanol concentration (BAC).  \n- **Peak BAC:** Usually 30–90 minutes after the first sip, depending on the factors below.  \n- **Rate of absorption:** Roughly **0.1–0.2 g of ethanol per kilogram of body weight per hour** for a typical drink.  \n  - For a 70 kg adult, that’s about **7–14 g per hour** (≈1–2 standard drinks).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Factors that shift the curve\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher ABV → faster absorption | Ethanol is more “soluble” in the stomach lining. |\n| **Presence of food** | Slows gastric emptying → delayed peak | Fat and protein bind ethanol, delaying its entry into the bloodstream. |\n| **Empty stomach** | Faster absorption → higher peak | No food to compete for absorption. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Larger body → slower rise per unit | More blood volume dilutes ethanol. |\n| **Gender** | Women often reach higher BAC faster | Lower body water and alcohol‑dehydrogenase activity. |\n| **Metabolic rate** | Faster metabolism → lower peak | Liver enzymes (ADH, ALDH) work faster. |\n| **Tolerance** | Can blunt the subjective effects | Body adapts to repeated exposure. |\n| **Medications & other substances** | Can inhibit or induce ADH | e.g., disulfiram (inhibits ADH) vs. certain antibiotics (induce ADH). |\n| **Temperature & hydration** | Dehydration → higher BAC | Less water to dilute ethanol. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. What the numbers look like in practice\n\n| Scenario | Approx. BAC after 30 min | Approx. BAC after 60 min | Peak BAC |\n|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| 1 standard drink (5 % beer) on an empty stomach | 0.02–0.03 % | 0.04–0.05 % | 0.05–0.06 % |\n| 1 standard drink on a full stomach | 0.01–0.02 % | 0.03–0.04 % | 0.04–0.05 % |\n| 1 shot (40 % ABV) on an empty stomach | 0.04–0.05 % | 0.07–0.08 % | 0.08–0.10 % |\n\n> **Remember:** These are averages. Individual variation can be large.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How long does it stay in the body?\n\n- **Metabolism (elimination)** is slower than absorption.  \n- Typical elimination rate: **≈0.015 % BAC per hour** (≈10–15 g of ethanol per hour).  \n- So after the peak, BAC will decline at roughly that rate until it’s cleared.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick take‑away\n\n- **Alcohol is absorbed very quickly**—most of it is in your bloodstream within an hour.  \n- **Peak BAC** usually occurs 30–90 minutes after you start drinking, but can be as fast as 15 minutes for high‑ABV drinks on an empty stomach.  \n- **Factors like food, body weight, gender, and metabolism** can shift the timing and magnitude of that peak.\n\nIf you’re planning a night out or need to know how long to wait before driving, remember that the body takes time to absorb and then even longer to eliminate alcohol. The safest rule of thumb: **wait at least 2–3 hours per standard drink** before getting behind the wheel.",

      "system_answer": "**Strep throat** is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused almost exclusively by the bacterium *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A β‑hemolytic streptococcus). It is one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adolescents, but adults can get it too.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How it Happens\n\n| Step | What Happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Exposure** | You inhale or touch droplets from an infected person’s cough, sneeze, or saliva. |\n| **Colonization** | The bacteria attach to the tonsillar or pharyngeal mucosa. |\n| **Invasion** | They produce toxins and enzymes that damage the tissue, leading to inflammation. |\n| **Immune response** | Your body releases white blood cells and antibodies, causing redness, swelling, and pain. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical Onset | Notes |\n|---------|---------------|-------|\n| **Sudden sore throat** | 1–2 days | Often worse than a viral sore throat. |\n| **Painful swallowing** | 1–2 days | Can be severe enough to avoid eating. |\n| **Fever** | 1–2 days | Usually ≥ 38 °C (100.4 °F). |\n| **Red, swollen tonsils** | 1–2 days | May have white or yellow patches (exudates). |\n| **Tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth** (petechiae) | 1–2 days | Classic sign. |\n| **Swollen, tender cervical lymph nodes** | 1–2 days | Often on the side of the neck. |\n| **Headache, body aches, nausea** | 1–2 days | Common in children. |\n| **Absence of cough** | 1–2 days | Viral infections usually have a cough. |\n\n> **Tip:** A rapid rise in fever, severe throat pain, and the presence of white patches on the tonsils are strong clues that it’s bacterial rather than viral.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | How it’s done | What it tells you |\n|------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT)** | A swab of the throat is tested in a clinic or lab. | Detects *S. pyogenes* antigens in ~5–15 min. |\n| **Throat culture** | Swab is cultured on agar plates; incubated 24–48 h. | Gold standard; confirms the bacteria and checks antibiotic sensitivity. |\n| **Clinical scoring systems** (e.g., Centor or McIsaac) | Uses symptoms and age to estimate probability. | Helps decide whether testing is needed. |\n\n> **Why both tests?** RADT is quick but can miss some cases; a negative RADT followed by a positive culture is possible.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Treatment | What it does | Typical course |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Antibiotics** (most common) | Kill the bacteria, reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and stop transmission. | Penicillin V or amoxicillin: 10 days (or 5 days of amoxicillin‑clavulanate for children). |\n| **Pain & fever control** | NSAIDs (ibuprofen) or acetaminophen. | As needed. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Supports recovery. | Daily. |\n| **Avoid irritants** (smoke, strong odors) | Reduces throat irritation. | Until symptoms resolve. |\n\n> **Why antibiotics?** They shorten the illness by ~1 day, reduce the risk of rheumatic fever (rare in developed countries), and lower the chance of spreading the infection to others.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Complications (if untreated)\n\n| Complication | How it develops | Prevention |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------|\n| **Rheumatic fever** | Autoimmune reaction to bacterial antigens. | Prompt antibiotic treatment. |\n| **Post‑streptococcal glomerulonephritis** | Immune complexes deposit in kidneys. | Antibiotics, good hygiene. |\n| **Peritonsillar abscess** | Infection spreads to surrounding tissues. | Early treatment, monitor for severe pain or difficulty breathing. |\n| **Scarlet fever** | Toxin‑mediated rash. | Antibiotics. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Prevention\n\n| Strategy | How it helps |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Hand hygiene** | Reduces spread of bacteria. |\n| **Cover coughs/sneezes** | Limits droplet transmission. |\n| **Avoid close contact** with infected individuals until they’ve been on antibiotics for 24 h. |\n| **Vaccination** | No vaccine for strep throat, but flu vaccines reduce viral infections that can predispose to secondary strep. |\n| **Prompt medical care** | Early diagnosis and treatment reduce complications. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can I get strep throat from a cold?** | No. Strep is bacterial; colds are viral. |\n| **Do I need antibiotics if I have a sore throat?** | Only if a bacterial cause is confirmed or highly suspected. |\n| **Will I still spread it after starting antibiotics?** | Usually after 24 h of appropriate antibiotics you’re no longer contagious. |\n| **Is strep throat contagious after 48 h?** | Yes, until you’ve been on antibiotics for at least 24 h. |\n| **Can I treat it at home with painkillers?** | Painkillers help, but antibiotics are needed to cure the infection. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial infection of the throat caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It presents with sudden, severe sore throat, fever, and white patches on the tonsils, and is diagnosed with a rapid test or throat culture. Prompt antibiotic treatment (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) is essential to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and stop transmission.",

Diagnosis\n\n| Test | How it’s done | What it tells you |\n|------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Virus isolation** (cell culture) | Stool or throat swab | Confirms poliovirus; identifies serotype |\n| **PCR** | Stool, CSF, or blood | Rapid, highly sensitive |\n| **Serology** | Blood sample | Detects anti‑polio IgM (recent infection) or IgG (past exposure) |\n| **CSF analysis** | Lumbar puncture | Elevated protein, normal cell count in paralytic polio |\n\n> **Key point:** In most cases, diagnosis is clinical; laboratory confirmation is mainly for surveillance and outbreak control.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Treatment\n\n| Approach | What it involves | Effectiveness |\n|----------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Supportive care** | Hydration, pain control, physical therapy | Improves recovery, reduces complications |\n| **Respiratory support** | Mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy | Life‑saving in severe respiratory paralysis |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening, stretching | Helps regain function |\n| **No antiviral** | No specific drug exists | Treatment is purely supportive |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Prevention\n\n| Strategy | How it works |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) |\n| **IPV** | Injected, induces systemic immunity; no risk of vaccine‑derived polio |\n| **OPV** | Oral, induces mucosal immunity; rare risk of vaccine‑derived polio (especially in low‑immunity settings) |\n| **Hygiene & sanitation** | Clean water, handwashing, proper sewage disposal |\n| **Surveillance** | Rapid detection of cases, containment of outbreaks |\n\n> **Global eradication effort**: Since 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has reduced cases by >99 %. Polio is now endemic only in a few countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and a few regions in Nigeria).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Epidemiology (as of 2024)\n\n| Region | Current status | Notes |\n|--------|----------------|-------|\n| **Global** | Endemic in 3 countries | Ongoing vaccination campaigns |\n| **United States** | Polio‑free (last case 1979) | Routine IPV immunization |\n| **Europe** | Polio‑free | Routine IPV; occasional imported cases |\n| **Africa** | Several countries still endemic | OPV used; high vaccination coverage needed |\n| **Asia** | Afghanistan, Pakistan | OPV campaigns; conflict zones hinder coverage |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Key Take‑aways\n\n1. **Poliomyelitis** is a viral disease that can cause irreversible paralysis.  \n2. **Transmission** is primarily fecal‑oral; good sanitation and hand hygiene are critical.  \n3. **Vaccination** (IPV or OPV) is the only effective prevention; it has nearly eradicated the disease worldwide.  \n4. **Early detection** and supportive care are essential; there is no specific antiviral treatment.  \n5. **Global eradication** is almost complete, but pockets of endemicity remain, requiring sustained vaccination and surveillance.\n\n---\n\n### Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Short Answer |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Can polio be caught from a cough?** | Rarely; fecal‑oral is the main route. |\n| **Do adults get polio?** | Yes, but only if unvaccinated or not immune. |\n| **Is OPV still used?** | Yes, in many low‑resource settings; IPV is preferred in high‑income countries. |\n| **What is vaccine‑derived polio?** | A rare strain that can emerge from OPV in under‑immunized populations. |\n| **Can you get polio after vaccination?** | Only with OPV in very rare cases; IPV is safe. |\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like more detail on any specific aspect!",

      "question": "What is the temperature at the center of the earth ?",
      "system_answer": "**Temperature at the Center of the Earth**\n\n| Layer | Depth Range | Composition | Estimated Temperature |\n|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Outer Core** | 2,890 – 5,150 km | Liquid iron‑nickel alloy (with light elements) | ~4,000 – 5,000 °C |\n| **Inner Core** | 5,150 – 6,371 km (center) | Solid iron‑nickel alloy | **≈ 5,500 – 6,000 °C** |\n\n> **Typical consensus:** The temperature at the very center (inner‑core boundary) is about **5,500 °C to 6,000 °C** (≈ 5,800 °F to 6,400 °F).  \n> This is roughly the temperature of the surface of the Sun’s photosphere, but the Earth’s core is solid because of the enormous pressure (~3.5 million bar).\n\n---\n\n## How Do Scientists Estimate This Temperature?\n\n1. **Seismic Wave Analysis**  \n   - **P‑waves** (compressional) and **S‑waves** (shear) travel through the Earth.  \n   - Their velocities depend on density, elastic moduli, and temperature.  \n   - By measuring travel times and using models of Earth’s composition, scientists infer temperature gradients.\n\n2. **Equation‑of‑State (EOS) Models**  \n   - Laboratory experiments compress iron and iron alloys to core pressures (≈ 330 GPa).  \n   - EOS data link pressure, density, and temperature.  \n   - Combining seismic velocities with EOS gives temperature estimates.\n\n3. **Geodynamo Simulations**  \n   - The Earth’s magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core.  \n   - Numerical models of the geodynamo require a certain temperature contrast to drive convection; this constrains core temperatures.\n\n4. **Heat Flow Measurements**  \n   - Surface heat flow (~0.07 W m⁻²) and mantle convection models help estimate the total heat leaving the core, which in turn constrains core temperature.\n\n5. **Laboratory High‑Pressure Experiments**  \n   - Diamond‑anvil cells and shock‑compression experiments replicate core conditions, providing direct temperature–pressure data for iron alloys.\n\n---\n\n## Why the Temperature Is So High\n\n- **Gravitational Compression:** As Earth formed, gravitational energy was converted into heat.  \n- **Radioactive Decay:** Decay of U‑238, Th‑232, and K‑40 in the mantle and core contributes ~20 % of the core’s heat.  \n- **Residual Formation Heat:** The Earth is still cooling, but the core remains hot because of the slow rate of heat loss.\n\n---\n\n## Uncertainties & Ranges\n\n| Source of Uncertainty | Effect on Temperature |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Composition of the core** (amount of light elements like S, Si, O) | ± 200 °C |\n| **Equation‑of‑State parameters** | ± 200 °C |\n| **Seismic velocity‑temperature conversion** | ± 200 °C |\n| **Heat‑flow measurements** | ± 200 °C |\n\n**Combined uncertainty**: roughly ± 400 °C.  \nThus, the most widely cited range is **5,500 – 6,400 °C**.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Takeaway\n\n- **Inner core temperature ≈ 5,500 – 6,000 °C** (solid iron‑nickel alloy).  \n- **Outer core temperature ≈ 4,000 – 5,000 °C** (liquid).  \n- These values are derived from seismic data, laboratory experiments, and geodynamo modeling, with an overall uncertainty of a few hundred degrees.\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like more details on any of the methods or the implications for Earth’s magnetic field!",

      "system_answer": "**The Statue of Liberty is a composite structure made of several materials, each chosen for its specific properties:**\n\n| Layer / Component | Material | Purpose / Key Details |\n|-------------------|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Exterior skin (the “cladding”)** | **Copper** (≈ 6,000 lb of copper sheets) | Gives the statue its iconic green patina (verdigris). Copper is malleable, corrosion‑resistant, and can be hammered into the fine details of the robe, face, and torch. |\n| **Internal skeleton (originally)** | **Iron** (cast‑iron ribs) | The original 1880s design used a lattice of cast‑iron ribs to support the copper skin. Iron was chosen for its strength and availability at the time. |\n| **Modern reinforcement (since 1900s)** | **Steel** (wrought‑iron/steel framework) | In the early 20th‑century, the iron skeleton was replaced with a more robust steel framework (about 1,000 lb of steel). Steel provides greater tensile strength and flexibility, allowing the statue to withstand wind and seismic forces. |\n| **Foundation** | **Concrete & stone** | The pedestal is a massive concrete block (≈ 1.5 million lb) poured over a granite base. The concrete anchors the statue to the bedrock of Liberty Island. |\n| **Torch and crown** | **Copper** (same as skin) | The torch’s flame is a copper alloy, and the crown’s 7 rays are also copper. |\n| **Interior support** | **Steel cables & rods** | Inside the statue, steel cables tie the ribs together, ensuring structural integrity. |\n\n### Quick Summary\n\n- **Outer shell:** *Copper* (green patina).  \n- **Primary skeleton:** *Steel* (replacing the original iron).  \n- **Foundation:** *Concrete* on a *granite* base.  \n\nThe combination of copper for the visible surface and steel for the internal framework gives the Statue of Liberty both its beautiful appearance and its structural resilience.",

      "question": "What is solar wind ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous, supersonic outflow of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It streams through the entire solar system, carrying with it the Sun’s magnetic field and shaping the space environment around every planet.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How It Forms\n\n| Step | Process | Key Points |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| **1. Coronal Heating** | The Sun’s outer atmosphere (corona) is heated to millions of kelvin. | This extreme temperature gives particles enough kinetic energy to escape the Sun’s gravity. |\n| **2. Pressure Gradient** | Hot plasma expands outward because of the pressure difference between the corona and interplanetary space. | The expansion is driven by thermal pressure and magnetic forces. |\n| **3. Magnetic Field Guidance** | The Sun’s magnetic field lines open into space, forming “magnetic flux tubes.” | Solar wind streams along these open field lines. |\n| **4. Acceleration** | Various mechanisms (e.g., wave‑particle interactions, reconnection) accelerate the plasma to speeds of 300–800 km s⁻¹. | The result is a supersonic, superelectromagnetic flow. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Composition & Properties\n\n| Property | Typical Value | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Primary particles** | ~ 95 % protons, ~ 4 % electrons, ~ 1 % alpha particles (He²⁺) | Trace heavier ions (C, N, O, Fe) are also present. |\n| **Speed** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ (average ~ 400 km s⁻¹) | Varies with solar activity and solar‑wind “streams.” |\n| **Density** | ~ 5–10 particles cm⁻³ at 1 AU (Earth’s orbit) | Decreases roughly as 1/r² with distance from the Sun. |\n| **Temperature** | ~ 1–2 million K (protons), ~ 0.5 million K (electrons) | Very hot, but still cooler than the corona. |\n| **Magnetic field** | ~ 5 nT at 1 AU | Carries the Sun’s interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). |\n| **Variability** | Solar‑cycle dependent (≈ 11 yr) | Faster “high‑speed streams” from coronal holes; slower, denser “stream‑interaction regions” from active regions. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Solar‑Wind Regimes\n\n| Regime | Characteristics | Typical Speed |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **Fast Solar Wind** | Originates from coronal holes (open magnetic field). | 600–800 km s⁻¹ |\n| **Slow Solar Wind** | Originates near the Sun’s equatorial belt, often associated with the heliospheric current sheet. | 300–500 km s⁻¹ |\n| **Transient Events** | Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can eject plasma at > 2000 km s⁻¹, carrying huge magnetic flux. | Variable |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Effects on the Solar System\n\n| Effect | What Happens |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Heliosphere Formation** | Solar wind pushes against the interstellar medium, creating a bubble (the heliosphere) that shields the inner planets from galactic cosmic rays. |\n| **Planetary Magnetospheres** | The interaction of solar wind with a planet’s magnetic field creates bow shocks, magnetotails, and auroras (e.g., Earth’s Northern Lights). |\n| **Space Weather** | CMEs and high‑speed streams can compress Earth’s magnetosphere, trigger geomagnetic storms, and affect satellites, power grids, and radio communications. |\n| **Cometary Activity** | Solar wind ionizes cometary gases, creating ion tails that point away from the Sun. |\n| **Atmospheric Escape** | Over geological timescales, solar wind can strip atmospheres from bodies lacking magnetic protection (e.g., Mars). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Observations & Measurements\n\n| Instrument / Mission | What It Measures |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| **ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer)** | Solar wind speed, density, temperature, composition, IMF. |\n| **Wind** | In situ plasma and magnetic field data near Earth. |\n| **Parker Solar Probe** | Directly samples the solar wind close to the Sun (down to 0.1 AU). |\n| **Solar Orbiter** | Combines remote sensing (imaging, spectroscopy) with in situ plasma measurements. |\n| **Ground‑based** | Radio scintillation, interplanetary scintillation (IPS) to infer solar‑wind speed. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Concepts for Further Study\n\n- **Alfvén Speed** – the speed at which magnetic disturbances travel in the plasma; solar wind often exceeds this speed, making it “supersonic” and “super‑Alfvénic.”\n- **Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)** – the framework that describes the coupled dynamics of plasma and magnetic fields in the solar wind.\n- **Heliospheric Current Sheet** – the surface where the Sun’s magnetic polarity flips; the solar wind’s interaction with this sheet creates the “ballerina skirt” structure of the heliosphere.\n- **Space Weather Forecasting** – uses solar‑wind data to predict geomagnetic storms and protect technological infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSolar wind is a hot, ionized plasma stream that flows outward from the Sun, carrying its magnetic field and influencing every planet and spacecraft in the solar system. Its speed, density, and magnetic structure vary with solar activity, making it a central driver of space weather and heliospheric physics.",

      "system_answer": "**Severance pay** is a financial benefit that an employer may provide to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually through a layoff, termination, or mutual separation. It is not a legal requirement in most jurisdictions (except in a few countries or under specific collective agreements), but it is a common practice in many companies to:\n\n| Purpose | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Financial cushion** | Helps the employee bridge the gap between jobs. |\n| **Goodwill & reputation** | Shows the company cares about its workforce, which can aid future hiring and reduce negative publicity. |\n| **Legal protection** | Reduces the risk of wrongful‑termination lawsuits or claims of discrimination. |\n| **Compliance** | Meets statutory or contractual obligations (e.g., in the EU, some U.S. states, or under union contracts). |\n\n### Typical Components\n\n| Component | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Base severance** | Usually a set number of weeks or months of salary (e.g., 1–3 weeks per year of service). |\n| **Bonus or incentive payout** | Pro‑rata payment of any earned bonuses that were not yet paid. |\n| **Benefits continuation** | Extension of health insurance, retirement contributions, or other benefits for a limited period. |\n| **Outplacement services** | Career counseling, résumé workshops, or job‑search assistance. |\n| **Non‑compete or confidentiality clauses** | Often tied to the severance agreement. |\n\n### Common Formulae\n\n- **U.S. (informal)**: 1–2 weeks of pay per year of service, capped at a certain amount (e.g., $10,000–$20,000).  \n- **U.K.**: 2–3 weeks’ pay per year of service, with a maximum of 12–24 weeks.  \n- **Australia**: 4–6 weeks’ pay per year of service, capped at 12–24 weeks.  \n- **Canada**: 1–2 weeks per year, capped at 26 weeks.  \n\nThese are guidelines; actual packages vary widely.\n\n### Legal Landscape\n\n| Region | Key Points |\n|--------|------------|\n| **United States** | No federal law mandates severance; some states (e.g., California) require payment of accrued vacation. |\n| **European Union** | Member states have varying rules; some require notice periods and compensation (e.g., Germany’s “Abfindung”). |\n| **Australia** | The Fair Work Act requires a “payment in lieu of notice” if the employee is dismissed without notice. |\n| **Canada** | Employment standards legislation may require payment of accrued vacation and notice, but severance is usually contractual. |\n\n### How It Works in Practice\n\n1. **Notice of termination** is given (or a notice period is waived).  \n2. **Severance agreement** is drafted, outlining the amount, payment schedule, and any conditions (e.g., release of claims).  \n3. **Employee signs** the agreement (often after legal review).  \n4. **Payments** are made according to the agreed schedule (often in a lump sum or installments).  \n\n### When It’s Not Offered\n\n- **Voluntary resignation** (unless part of a negotiated exit package).  \n- **Termination for cause** (e.g., gross misconduct).  \n- **Contractual or statutory limits** (e.g., if the employee is already entitled to a statutory redundancy payment).\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Severance pay is a negotiated or contractual payment that helps employees transition after job loss, providing financial support and sometimes additional benefits, while also protecting the employer from potential legal claims.",

      "system_answer": "### Semiconductors – A Quick Overview\n\n| Topic | What it means |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **Definition** | Materials whose electrical conductivity lies between that of conductors (e.g., copper) and insulators (e.g., glass). |\n| **Key property** | Their ability to be “tuned” by adding impurities (doping) or by applying electric fields, light, or temperature changes. |\n| **Typical materials** | Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Indium Phosphide (InP), Silicon Carbide (SiC), Gallium Nitride (GaN), etc. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why “Semiconductor”?\n\n- **Band‑gap physics**: In a crystal, electrons occupy energy bands. The *valence band* is filled; the *conduction band* is empty. The energy difference between them is the *band gap* (Eg).  \n  - **Insulators**: Eg > 4 eV → very few electrons can jump to the conduction band.  \n  - **Conductors**: Overlap of valence and conduction bands → electrons flow freely.  \n  - **Semiconductors**: Eg ≈ 0.5–4 eV → a moderate number of electrons can be excited across the gap, especially with a little energy (heat, light, doping).\n\n- **Temperature dependence**: As temperature rises, more electrons gain enough energy to cross the gap, so conductivity increases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Doping – Turning a Semiconductor into a Conductor\n\n| Type | Process | Resulting Carrier | Example |\n|------|---------|-------------------|---------|\n| **n‑type** | Add pentavalent atoms (e.g., phosphorus) to silicon | Extra electrons (negative charge carriers) | Si:P |\n| **p‑type** | Add trivalent atoms (e.g., boron) to silicon | “Holes” (missing electrons, positive charge carriers) | Si:B |\n\n- **p–n junction**: When p‑type and n‑type regions meet, an electric field forms, enabling devices like diodes and transistors.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Semiconductor Devices\n\n| Device | How it works | Typical use |\n|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Diode** | p–n junction allows current one way | Rectifiers, LEDs, photodiodes |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Uses p–n junctions or field‑effect to amplify/ switch | CPUs, memory, power electronics |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Many transistors on a single chip | All modern electronics |\n| **Solar cell** | Photovoltaic effect in p–n junction | Solar panels |\n| **Laser diode** | Stimulated emission in a semiconductor | Fiber‑optic comms, barcode scanners |\n| **Photodetector** | Light generates carriers in a semiconductor | Cameras, sensors |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Materials & Their Strengths\n\n| Material | Band Gap (eV) | Common Applications |\n|----------|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | 1.12 | CMOS ICs, solar cells, sensors |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | 0.66 | High‑speed transistors, fiber‑optic detectors |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | 1.43 | RF/microwave ICs, LEDs, laser diodes |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | 3.26 | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices |\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | 3.4 | Power switches, blue/UV LEDs, RF amplifiers |\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Semiconductor Industry Snapshot\n\n- **Global market**: > $400 billion (2023) and growing, driven by smartphones, automotive electronics, AI, 5G, and renewable energy.\n- **Key players**: TSMC, Samsung, Intel, ASML (lithography), GlobalFoundries, UMC.\n- **Manufacturing**: Requires ultra‑clean rooms, photolithography, doping, etching, deposition, and rigorous testing.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom Line\n\nSemiconductors are the *workhorses* of modern technology. Their unique ability to conduct electricity under controlled conditions—thanks to band‑gap physics and doping—lets us build everything from tiny microchips to massive power‑switching grids. Without them, the digital age would not exist.",

      "question": "What does `` Sitting Shiva '' mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sitting Shiva** (also spelled *Shiva* or *Shivah*) is a traditional Jewish mourning ritual that takes place immediately after a close relative’s death. The term comes from the Hebrew word *שִׁבְעָה* (shiv‘ah), meaning “seven,” because the practice lasts for seven days.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Purpose\n\n- **Honoring the deceased**: The mourners gather to remember the person who died, reflecting on their life and legacy.\n- **Community support**: Family and friends come together to offer condolences, share memories, and provide emotional and practical help.\n- **Spiritual reflection**: The period allows mourners to process grief, seek comfort in faith, and find meaning in loss.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Who Observes It?\n\n- **Primary mourners**: The *bereaved* (the person who lost a parent, spouse, child, or sibling) sits in a special place called a *sitting‑shiva*.\n- **Extended family and friends**: Anyone who wishes to support the bereaved may visit, bring food, or offer prayers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How It’s Observed\n\n| Aspect | Typical Practice |\n|--------|------------------|\n| **Duration** | 7 consecutive days, starting the day after the funeral. |\n| **Location** | Usually in the home of the bereaved, but can be in a synagogue or other community space. |\n| **Seating** | The bereaved sits on a low chair or a cushion, often with a small table or a *shiva* (a small, low table) in front of them. |\n| **Visitors** | Friends and relatives come to offer condolences, share stories, and bring food. |\n| **Prayers** | The *Kaddish* (mourner’s prayer) is recited daily, often by a rabbi or a close friend. |\n| **Food** | Meals are prepared for visitors; the bereaved may eat only simple foods. |\n| **Silence & Reflection** | The atmosphere is generally quiet; mourners may sit in silence, read, or pray. |\n| **Restrictions** | Traditionally, the bereaved refrains from certain activities (e.g., no music, no dancing, no shaving). Modern practice varies widely. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Rituals & Symbols\n\n| Ritual | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Kaddish** | A prayer that praises God and acknowledges the sanctity of the deceased’s soul. |\n| **Shiva Table** | A low table with a candle, a cup of wine, and a small plate of food—symbolizing hospitality and the mourner’s need for support. |\n| **Candle Lighting** | A candle is lit for the deceased, often on the first day of Shiva. |\n| **Tearful Remembrance** | Mourners may cry openly; this is considered a healthy expression of grief. |\n| **“Shiva” in Hebrew** | The word itself means “seven,” underscoring the seven‑day period. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Variations Across Communities\n\n| Community | Typical Differences |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| **Orthodox** | Strict observance of all traditional rules; no music, no television. |\n| **Conservative** | Allows some modern conveniences (e.g., music, limited technology). |\n| **Reform / Reconstructionist** | May focus more on personal expression; some may skip the formal *Kaddish* or use a different prayer. |\n| **Diaspora vs. Israel** | In Israel, the *Shiva* may be shorter (often 6 days) due to the Sabbath schedule. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Modern Adaptations\n\n- **Digital Shiva**: Some families host virtual visits via video calls, especially when guests cannot travel.\n- **Support Groups**: Many synagogues offer grief counseling or support groups during the Shiva period.\n- **Personalization**: Families may incorporate personal rituals (e.g., playing the deceased’s favorite music after the formal Shiva ends).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Summary\n\n- **Sitting Shiva** is a seven‑day Jewish mourning practice that honors the deceased, supports the bereaved, and allows the community to gather in remembrance.\n- It involves specific rituals (Kaddish, candle lighting, a low table), a period of reflection, and communal support.\n- While rooted in tradition, the practice can be adapted to modern lifestyles and personal needs.\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like more details on any particular aspect—such as how to set up a Shiva table, the exact wording of the Kaddish, or how to support someone who is sitting Shiva.",

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It belongs to a family of disorders known as **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)**, which also include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer, and the human form, **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Happens in the Brain?\n\n- **Prions**: The disease is caused by misfolded proteins called *prions* (abbreviated PrP^Sc).  \n- **Spongiform change**: These prions accumulate in the brain, destroying neurons and creating a sponge‑like appearance.  \n- **Symptoms**: In cattle, this leads to ataxia (loss of coordination), abnormal behavior, weight loss, and eventually death (usually within 6–12 months after onset).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Does It Spread?\n\n| Route | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Feed‑borne** | The most common cause in the 1980s–1990s was feeding cattle with protein‑rich scraps from other animals (e.g., meat‑and‑bone meal). The prions survived the cooking process and entered the new host. |\n| **Vertical transmission** | Rarely, infected cows can pass prions to their offspring via the placenta. |\n| **Environmental contamination** | Prions are extremely resistant; they can persist in soil and on surfaces for years. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Human Connection\n\n- **Variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**: When humans consume contaminated beef products (especially brain or spinal‑cord tissue), prions can infect the brain, causing a rapidly progressive dementia that is invariably fatal.  \n- **Incidence**: Since the first reported case in 1996, fewer than 200 cases have been confirmed worldwide, largely due to strict controls.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Global Impact & Response\n\n| Country | Key Measures |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **United Kingdom** | 1986–1990s: BSE outbreak led to nationwide culling of millions of cattle, banning of high‑risk tissues, and mandatory surveillance. |\n| **United States** | 1990s: BSE cases in the U.S. were rare; strict feed‑stock regulations and testing of high‑risk tissues were implemented. |\n| **Other Nations** | Many countries adopted similar bans on ruminant protein in feed and mandatory testing of high‑risk tissues. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prevention & Control\n\n1. **Feed restrictions** – Ban on ruminant protein in cattle feed.  \n2. **Surveillance** – Routine testing of cattle over 30 months old and of high‑risk tissues (brain, spinal cord, eye, inner ear).  \n3. **Traceability** – Detailed record‑keeping of cattle movements and slaughter data.  \n4. **Public education** – Advisories on avoiding high‑risk tissues and proper cooking.  \n5. **Research** – Development of rapid diagnostic tests and potential vaccines (though none are currently approved).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Take‑aways\n\n- **BSE is a prion disease** that destroys the brain of cattle, leading to death.  \n- **Transmission** is primarily through contaminated feed, but prions are hardy and can persist in the environment.  \n- **Human risk** is low but serious; vCJD is fatal and linked to consumption of infected beef.  \n- **Global controls** (feed bans, surveillance, traceability) have dramatically reduced new cases.  \n\nIf you’re curious about the latest research or specific regulations in your country, let me know!",

      "question": "What is natural gas composed of ?",
      "system_answer": "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is not a single chemical but a mixture of hydrocarbons and other gases that varies with the geological source.  The most common components are:\n\n| Component | Typical range in a “clean” natural‑gas stream | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % (often 80–85 %) | The dominant constituent; the main energy source. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | Adds to calorific value; used in petrochemical feedstock. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Liquid at moderate pressure; used for heating and as a petrochemical feed. |\n| **Butane (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 2 % | Similar to propane; often co‑transported. |\n| **Other higher hydrocarbons (C₅⁺)** | < 1 % | Includes pentane, hexane, etc.; usually removed in processing. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; dilutes energy content. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; removed for pipeline quality. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.01 % (often < 10 ppm) | Toxic; must be scrubbed out. |\n| **Water vapor (H₂O)** | < 0.5 % | Condensed out during processing. |\n| **Trace gases** | < 0.1 % | Includes helium, argon, methane‑derived gases, etc. |\n\n### Why the composition varies\n- **Geology**: Different reservoirs (e.g., Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, offshore Gulf of Mexico) have distinct hydrocarbon ratios.\n- **Thermal maturity**: Older, hotter reservoirs produce more higher‑order hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane).\n- **Processing**: Natural gas is treated to remove impurities (H₂S, CO₂, water) and to separate higher hydrocarbons for sale as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas).\n\n### Typical “pipeline‑grade” natural gas\nFor most domestic and industrial use, the gas is processed to meet standards such as the U.S. **Natural Gas Code (NGC)** or the **European Pipeline Code (EPC)**.  These standards require:\n\n- **Methane** ≥ 90 % (for U.S. pipelines) or ≥ 85 % (for European pipelines).\n- **CO₂** ≤ 1 % (often < 0.5 %).\n- **H₂S** ≤ 10 ppm.\n- **Water** ≤ 10 ppm.\n\n### Bottom line\nNatural gas is primarily methane, with smaller amounts of ethane, propane, butane, and trace gases, plus a few non‑hydrocarbon impurities that are removed during processing.  The exact mix depends on the source and the treatment it has undergone.",
