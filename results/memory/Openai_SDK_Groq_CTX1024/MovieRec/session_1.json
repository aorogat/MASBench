Lots of witty banter, twists, and a bit of raunchy humor. | PG‑13, good for a 40‑year‑old crowd. |\n| **The Hangover** (and sequels) | 2009‑2013 | Classic “bachelor party” chaos with a lot of adult jokes. | PG‑13, but some scenes are a bit raunchy. |\n| **The World's End** | 2013 | A group of friends reunite for a pub crawl that turns into a sci‑fi adventure. | PG‑13, a bit of satire. |\n| **The Nice Guys** | 2016 | A buddy‑cop comedy with sharp dialogue and a bit of adult humor. | PG‑13, more action‑drama than pure comedy. |\n| **The Lovebirds** | 2020 | A couple’s night out turns into a crime caper. Lots of slapstick and witty banter. | PG‑13, light‑hearted. |\n| **The Lost City** | 2022 | A romance‑adventure with a lot of humor and a fun cast. | PG‑13, family‑friendly. |\n| **The Big Sick** | 2017 | A romantic‑comedy with a mix of humor and heartfelt moments. | PG‑13, more romantic than raunchy. |\n| **The 40‑Year‑Old Virgin** | 2005 | Classic “grown‑up” comedy with a lot of laughs. | PG‑13, a bit older but still relevant. |\n\n### How to pick the right one\n- **PG‑13** is usually safe for a 40‑year‑old group; it keeps the humor accessible without being too explicit.  \n- If you want something with a bit more adult humor but still family‑friendly, *Game Night* or *The Hangover* are solid choices.  \n- For a lighter, more family‑friendly vibe, *The Lost City* or *The Lovebirds* work well.\n\n---\n\n### Quick recommendation\nIf you’re already into *Jumanji*, you might enjoy **Game Night** next. It’s a great mix of comedy, mystery, and a bit of action—perfect for a group of friends looking for a laugh without going too far into raunchy territory.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re looking for something in a different genre!

      "system_answer": "Hey there! 🎬  \nGot it—looking for a classic DC‑themed action flick that’s a bit older than the recent blockbusters. Here’s a quick “old‑school DC” lineup that should hit the sweet spot:\n\n| # | Title | Year | Why It’s a Must‑See |\n|---|-------|------|---------------------|\n| 1 | **Superman** | 1978 | The original superhero film that set the bar for the genre. Classic, campy, and iconic. |\n| 2 | **Batman** | 1989 | Tim Burton’s dark, gothic take on the Caped Crusader. Think brooding, stylish, and a bit of 80s flair. |\n| 3 | **Batman Returns** | 1992 | The sequel that amps up the darkness—think Catwoman, the Penguin, and a more mature tone. |\n| 4 | **Batman Forever** | 1995 | A lighter, more colorful spin‑off with Jim Carrey as the Riddler. Fun, goofy, and still action‑packed. |\n| 5 | **Batman & Robin** | 1997 | The “fluffy” finale of the 90s Batman series—great for a nostalgic, tongue‑in‑cheek watch. |\n| 6 | **The Dark Knight** | 2008 | While newer, it’s a classic‑era feel with a gritty, realistic tone. Heath Ledger’s Joker is unforgettable. |\n| 7 | **Superman II** | 1980 | The sequel that adds more villains and a deeper storyline—still a solid 80s action film. |\n| 8 | **The Adventures of Superman** (TV Series) | 1948‑1950 | If you’re up for a bit of nostalgia, this early TV series is a charming look at the Man of Steel. |\n\n### Quick Tips for Watching\n\n- **Streaming**:  \n  - *Superman* (1978) & *Batman* (1989) are often on **HBO Max** or **Amazon Prime**.  \n  - *Batman Returns* & *Batman Forever* can be found on **Hulu** or **Amazon Prime**.  \n  - *The Dark Knight* is usually on **HBO Max** or **Disney+** (in some regions).  \n\n- **Soundtrack**:  \n  - If you’re into iconic scores, *Batman* (1989) has Danny Elfman’s unforgettable theme—perfect for a nostalgic vibe.\n\n- **Watch Party**:  \n  - Pair *Batman* (1989) with *Superman* (1978) for a classic “hero showdown” night.  \n  - Or go full “DC Marathon” with *Batman* → *Batman Returns* → *Batman Forever* → *Batman & Robin* for a 90s vibe.\n\nLet me know which one catches your eye, or if you’d like a deeper dive into any of these films (or maybe a different DC classic).

The horror is toned down, and the focus is more on the kids’ friendship and the mystery of the town.  \n- **Why it’s interesting**:  \n  - **Nostalgic charm** – many people grew up watching it on cable.  \n  - **Strong performances** – the young cast (including a young *It*‑villain, the “Pennywise” puppet) are solid.  \n  - **Atmosphere** – the 90s production design gives it a distinct, slightly campy vibe that’s fun to watch if you’re into retro horror.  \n- **Not for pure scares**: If you’re looking for the jump‑scare intensity of the 2017 film or the psychological dread of *Get Out*, this one will feel a bit light.

      "system_answer": "I haven’t watched *Scream* myself (I’m just a virtual assistant, after all), but it’s definitely a classic in the horror‑slasher genre and a great pick if you’re looking for something that blends scares with a bit of meta‑commentary on the genre.\n\n### Quick rundown\n- **Release:** 1996  \n- **Director:** Wes Craven  \n- **Stars:** Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and a cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis (the “Scream Queen” herself).  \n- **Plot:** A group of high‑school kids in the small town of Woodsboro are stalked by a masked killer who knows the rules of horror movies. The film cleverly breaks the fourth wall, with characters discussing tropes while being hunted.\n\n### Why it’s worth watching\n- **Genre‑breaking:** It revitalized the slasher genre in the ’90s by making the killer a “meta‑character” who knows the rules of the genre.  \n- **Humor & tension:** Balances genuine scares with witty dialogue and self‑aware humor.  \n- **Iconic moments:** The “Scream” scream, the “Scream” mask, and the final reveal are instantly recognizable.  \n- **Influence:** Spawned a franchise and inspired countless other horror films that play with genre conventions.\n\n### If you’re in the mood for more\n- **Scream 2 (1997)** – Keeps the meta‑elements but ups the stakes.  \n- **Scream 3 (2000)** – Adds a supernatural twist.  \n- **Scream 4 (2011)** – Returns to the original tone with a new cast.  \n- **The Cabin in the Woods (2012)** – A modern take on horror tropes with a twist.  \n- **It Follows (2014)** – A fresh, atmospheric horror with a unique premise.\n\nLet me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any of these, or if you’re looking for something else entirely!",

It follows a group of kids in the small town of Derry, Maine, who are terrorized by a shape‑shifting entity that often appears as a clown. The story is set in the 1980s and explores how the town’s dark history and the kids’ own fears feed the creature’s power. |\n| **Tone** | Pure horror—no comedic moments. Think classic Stephen King dread, creepy atmosphere, and a lot of jump‑scares. |\n| **Why it’s different from the 1990 version** | • 1990 was a **miniseries** (8 episodes) that covered the entire story arc (both the 1980s and the 2000s). <br>• 2017 focuses only on the **1980s** portion, giving a tighter, more cinematic experience. <br>• The 2017 film is darker, with a more modern visual style and a stronger emphasis on the psychological terror of the kids. |\n| **Sequel** | “It Chapter Two” (2019) picks up the story in the 1990s, following the same group of kids as adults. |\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\n- If you’re looking for a **classic horror** experience with a modern twist, the 2017 “It” is the one to watch.  \n- It’s **not** a comedy or a stoner flick—so if you’re in the mood for laughs, you might want to keep it separate from your comedy lineup.\n\nLet me know if you’d like a recommendation for a horror film that’s a bit lighter, or if you want to dive back into the comedy side of things!",

      "system_answer": "Hey! 🎉\n\n**Shrek (2001)** is a great pick if you’re in a “childish” mood—it's full of playful humor, but it’s not over‑the‑top with fart jokes. The film’s comedy comes from:\n\n| Element | What you’ll see |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Wordplay & Pop‑Culture References** | Lots of puns, fairy‑tale mash‑ups, and nods to classic movies (think “Don’t be a *sh*” and the “I’m a big deal” meme). |\n| **Character‑Driven Gags** | Shrek’s grumpy‑but‑lovable nature, Donkey’s endless chatter, and the quirky side‑characters (the Three‑Little‑Pigs, the Gingerbread Man, etc.). |\n| **Visual Humor** | Silly animation moments (e.g., the “Donkey’s “I’m a big deal” dance” and the “Shrek’s swamp‑splash” scenes). |\n| **Eddie Murphy’s Voice** | He voices Donkey, and his comedic timing is spot‑on. The jokes are more about Donkey’s goofy personality than explicit fart jokes. |\n\n### About the Fart Jokes\n- **Occasional**: There are a few light‑hearted, cartoonish fart moments (e.g., the “Donkey’s fart” in the swamp), but they’re not the main focus.\n- **Tone**: The humor stays family‑friendly; it’s more about the absurdity of the characters than crudeness.\n\n### Why Eddie Murphy is Worth It\n- **Voice Performance**: Murphy brings Donkey to life with a mix of sarcasm, optimism, and a bit of cluelessness. His delivery is the backbone of the film’s humor.\n- **Catchy Lines**: “Don’t be a *sh*” and “I’m a big deal” are instantly memorable and have become meme staples.\n- **Energy**: His voice adds a lively, comedic rhythm that keeps the movie engaging for all ages.\n\n### Quick Verdict\n- **If you’re looking for a light, family‑friendly comedy with a good dose of humor and minimal crude jokes, Shrek is a solid choice.**  \n- **Eddie Murphy’s Donkey is definitely worth the watch—his jokes are clever, not crude.**\n\nEnjoy your trip back to the swamp! 🌱🍟 If you want more recommendations that balance humor with a mature vibe, just let me know.",

Here’s a quick snapshot of what I usually gravitate toward:\n\n| Genre | Why I Love It | Recent/Classic Picks |\n|-------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Classic Hitchcock** | Masterful suspense + iconic twists | *North by Northwest* (1959), *Rear Window* (1954) |\n| **Action‑Thrillers** | High‑energy chases, clever plots | *Die Hard* (1988), *Lethal Weapon* (1987) |\n| **Romantic Comedies with a Kick** | Light‑hearted romance + witty banter | *Pretty Woman* (1990), *When Harry Met Sally* (1989) |\n| **Disaster/Survival** | Intense stakes + human drama | *San Andreas* (2015), *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004) |\n| **Car‑Centric Action** | Fast cars + stunts | *The Fast & the Furious* series, *Gone in 60 Seconds* (2000) |\n\n### About *North by Northwest*\nYes, it’s definitely an action‑thriller (though it’s more of a “spy‑spy” caper than a modern action movie). Hitchcock’s signature suspense, the iconic crop‑duster chase, and the “wrong man” plot make it a timeless classic. If you haven’t seen it yet, it’s a must‑watch—especially if you enjoy a blend of suspense, humor, and a dash of romance.\n\n### About *Pretty Woman*\nA classic rom‑com that still feels fresh. Julia Roberts’ charm and the film’s blend of humor, romance, and a bit of social commentary make it a perennial favorite. If you love that vibe, you might also enjoy *The Princess Diaries* (2001) or *Notting Hill* (1999).\n\n### About *San Andreas*\nI haven’t watched *San Andreas* yet, but it’s a solid disaster‑action film with a lot of high‑octane scenes and a strong emotional core. If you’re into that genre, you might also like *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004) or *2012* (2009).\n\n---\n\n**What’s your next movie night?**  \n- Are you leaning toward a Hitchcock classic, a rom‑com, or something else?  \n- Or maybe you’re in the mood for a modern action flick with a twist?  \n\nLet me know, and I can suggest a few more titles that fit the bill!",
