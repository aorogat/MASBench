      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the range of heart‑beat speeds (beats per minute, or bpm) that you aim for during aerobic exercise to achieve specific fitness or health goals. It’s a way to gauge how hard your heart is working and to keep your workout at an intensity that’s safe and effective.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Goal | Typical target zone | Why it’s useful |\n|------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| **Weight loss / calorie burn** | 50–70 % of maximum heart rate | Burns more calories while staying comfortable |\n| **Cardiovascular fitness** | 70–85 % of maximum heart rate | Improves heart and lung efficiency |\n| **Endurance training** | 60–80 % of maximum heart rate | Builds stamina for longer activities |\n| **High‑intensity interval training (HIIT)** | 80–95 % of maximum heart rate | Maximizes anaerobic capacity and speed |\n\n---\n\n### How to calculate it\n\n1. **Find your maximum heart rate (MHR)**  \n   The most common estimate:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{MHR} = 220 - \\text{age}\n   \\]\n   (e.g., a 30‑year‑old → 190 bpm)\n\n2. **Determine the target zone**  \n   Multiply MHR by the desired percentage.  \n   *Example:* 70 % of 190 bpm = 133 bpm.\n\n3. **Use a heart‑rate monitor or pulse check**  \n   - **Wearable**: chest strap, smartwatch, or fitness band.  \n   - **Manual**: count beats for 15 seconds, multiply by 4.\n\n---\n\n### Practical tips\n\n| Tip | Explanation |\n|-----|-------------|\n| **Warm up & cool down** | Start and finish outside the target zone to protect your heart. |\n| **Check for consistency** | Heart rate can vary day‑to‑day; use averages over several sessions. |\n| **Adjust for medications** | Some drugs lower heart rate; consult a professional. |\n| **Use a “talk test”** | If you can talk comfortably, you’re likely below target; if you can’t, you’re above. |\n| **Track progress** | Over time, you may hit the same target zone with less effort, indicating improved fitness. |\n\n---\n\n### Common misconceptions\n\n| Myth | Reality |\n|------|---------|\n| “The higher the heart rate, the better.” | Over‑exertion can be harmful; staying within a safe zone is key. |\n| “Target heart rate is the same for everyone.” | Age, fitness level, medications, and health conditions all influence the optimal zone. |\n| “You can’t use target heart rate if you’re not a runner.” | It applies to any aerobic activity—cycling, swimming, brisk walking, dancing, etc. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nTarget heart rate is a personalized, science‑backed tool that helps you exercise at the right intensity to meet your health, fitness, or performance goals while keeping your heart safe. Use it as a guide, not a rigid rule—listen to your body and adjust as needed.",

      "question": "What are enzymes ?",
      "system_answer": "**Enzymes** are biological catalysts—specialized proteins (or, in rare cases, RNA molecules) that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n| Feature | What It Means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Catalytic activity** | They lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed faster and at lower temperatures. |\n| **Specificity** | Each enzyme typically acts on one particular substrate (or a small group of closely related substrates) and converts it into a specific product. |\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins with a unique 3‑D shape. The active site—often a pocket or cleft—binds the substrate(s). |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by: <br>• **Allosteric effectors** (activators or inhibitors that bind sites other than the active site). <br>• **Covalent modifications** (e.g., phosphorylation). <br>• **Gene expression** (how much enzyme is produced). |\n| **Reversible** | Many enzymes catalyze reversible reactions, allowing equilibrium to be shifted in either direction. |\n| **Co‑enzymes & cofactors** | Some enzymes require non‑protein helpers (e.g., metal ions, vitamins) to function. |\n\n---\n\n### How Enzymes Work (The “Lock‑and‑Key” Model)\n\n1. **Substrate Binding** – The substrate fits into the enzyme’s active site, forming an **enzyme‑substrate complex**.  \n2. **Transition State Stabilization** – The enzyme stabilizes the high‑energy transition state, lowering the activation energy.  \n3. **Product Formation** – The reaction proceeds, producing the product(s).  \n4. **Release** – The product leaves, and the enzyme is ready for another round.\n\n---\n\n### Everyday Examples\n\n| Process | Enzyme | Role |\n|---------|--------|------|\n| Digestion of starch | **Amylase** | Breaks α‑1,4‑glycosidic bonds → maltose, glucose |\n| Protein breakdown | **Pepsin** (stomach) | Hydrolyzes peptide bonds |\n| DNA replication | **DNA polymerase** | Adds nucleotides to a growing DNA strand |\n| Energy production | **Cytochrome c oxidase** (electron transport chain) | Transfers electrons to oxygen, driving ATP synthesis |\n\n---\n\n### Why Enzymes Matter\n\n- **Metabolism**: All metabolic pathways (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, fatty acid synthesis, etc.) rely on enzymes.  \n- **Homeostasis**: Enzymes regulate hormone levels, detoxify harmful substances, and maintain cellular pH.  \n- **Biotechnology**: Enzymes are used in food production (cheese, bread), pharmaceuticals (drug synthesis), biofuels, and diagnostics.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nEnzymes are the “workhorses” of biology—highly specific, efficient catalysts that enable life‑sustaining chemistry to happen at the mild temperatures and pressures of living cells.",

      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "**Short answer:**  \nThe Sun itself emits almost *white* light, but the Earth's atmosphere scatters the shorter (blue) wavelengths more strongly than the longer (yellow‑red) ones. When we look straight at the Sun, the blue light has been scattered out of the line of sight, leaving a yellow‑ish beam that reaches our eyes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the Sun actually emits\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Surface temperature | ~5 800 K |\n| Peak emission wavelength | ~500 nm (green‑yellow) |\n| Spectrum | Continuous black‑body spectrum (essentially white) |\n\nBecause the Sun’s surface temperature is close to that of a *white* star, its intrinsic color is white. If you could view the Sun from space, without any atmosphere, it would appear white (or very slightly yellow‑white, depending on the exact spectral mix).\n\n---\n\n## 2. The role of Earth’s atmosphere\n\n### Rayleigh scattering\n- **Mechanism:** Molecules and small particles in the air scatter light inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength (∝ 1/λ⁴).  \n- **Effect:** Blue (λ ≈ 450 nm) is scattered ~10× more than red (λ ≈ 650 nm).  \n- **Result:** The direct beam that reaches our eyes is depleted in blue, giving it a yellowish tint.\n\n### Mie scattering\n- **Mechanism:** Larger particles (dust, aerosols) scatter light almost equally across visible wavelengths.  \n- **Effect:** Adds a diffuse, white‑ish glow around the Sun, especially on hazy days.\n\n### Atmospheric absorption\n- **Ozone, water vapor, CO₂** absorb some wavelengths, slightly altering the spectral mix that reaches the surface.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why the Sun looks *yellow* rather than *white*\n\n- **Human vision:** Our eyes are more sensitive to green‑yellow light. The reduced blue component shifts the perceived color toward yellow.\n- **Sky color:** The sky itself is blue because scattered blue light dominates. The Sun, being the source of that light, appears complementary (yellowish) to the sky.\n- **Viewing angle:** At noon, the Sun is high in the sky, so the light path through the atmosphere is shortest—blue scattering is still significant, but the Sun still looks yellow.  \n  At sunrise/sunset, the light travels through a longer atmospheric path, scattering even more blue and red light, so the Sun turns orange/red.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Quick visual analogy\n\n| Scenario | Light path | Resulting color |\n|----------|------------|-----------------|\n| **Space** | No atmosphere | White |\n| **Clear noon** | Short path, Rayleigh scattering | Yellowish |\n| **Sunrise/sunset** | Long path, heavy scattering | Orange/red |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bottom line\n\n- **Intrinsic color:** White (black‑body spectrum).  \n- **Observed color on Earth:** Yellowish, due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light by the atmosphere.  \n- **Extreme cases:** At sunrise/sunset, the Sun can appear orange or red because the atmosphere scatters even more blue light and lets longer wavelengths dominate.\n\nSo, the Sun isn’t actually yellow; it’s our atmosphere that turns the white light into the familiar yellow glow we see from the ground.",

It is caused by a virus from the *Picornaviridae* family, genus *Aphthovirus*.\n\n---\n\n### Key facts\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Virus** | FMD virus (FMDV) – single‑stranded, positive‑sense RNA, ~8 kb.  Six serotypes (O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3) with many sub‑types. |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even airborne droplets over short distances. |\n| **Incubation** | 2–14 days (average ~5 days). |\n| **Clinical signs** | Fever, lameness, swelling of the feet, mouth, and tongue; painful vesicles (blisters) that rupture into ulcers. |\n| **Affected species** | Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, antelope, and many wildlife species. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses from mortality, reduced milk/meat production, trade restrictions, and costly control measures. |\n| **Control measures** | Vaccination (live‑attenuated or inactivated), movement restrictions, culling of infected and exposed animals, strict biosecurity, and surveillance. |\n| **Human health** | Rarely infects humans; when it does, it causes mild, self‑limiting symptoms (fever, sore throat). No long‑term disease. |\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Global trade:** FMD is listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as a disease that can severely restrict international trade in livestock and animal products.\n- **Outbreak history:** Major outbreaks have occurred in the UK (2001), the USA (2004–2005), China (2010), and many other countries, causing millions of dollars in losses.\n- **Vaccination strategy:** Because of the many serotypes, vaccines must be matched to the circulating strain; cross‑protection is limited.\n\n---\n\n### Quick take‑away\n\nFoot‑and‑mouth disease is a **viral, highly contagious disease of cloven‑hooved animals** that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth, leading to significant economic losses and strict control measures worldwide.",

      "question": "What is sonar ?",
      "system_answer": "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation And Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and characterize objects or features in a medium—most commonly water, but also air, ice, or even solid materials.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Sonar Works\n\n| Step | What Happens | Key Concept |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Transmission** | A transducer emits a short burst (pulsed) or continuous sound wave. | Acoustic pulse |\n| **Propagation** | The sound travels through the medium (water, air, etc.). | Speed of sound depends on temperature, salinity, pressure, etc. |\n| **Interaction** | The wave encounters an object or boundary. Part of the energy is reflected (echo), part is absorbed or refracted. | Reflection coefficient, impedance mismatch |\n| **Reception** | The transducer (or a separate receiver) picks up the echo. | Time‑of‑flight, frequency shift |\n| **Processing** | The received signal is analyzed to determine distance, size, shape, speed, and sometimes material properties. | Range = (speed × time)/2, Doppler shift for velocity |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Types of Sonar\n\n| Type | Description | Typical Use |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Active Sonar** | Emits a pulse and listens for echoes. | Submarine detection, fish finders, navigation, mapping |\n| **Passive Sonar** | Listens for sounds produced by other objects (e.g., engines, marine life). | Anti‑submarine warfare, marine biology |\n| **Imaging Sonar** | Uses high‑frequency pulses to create detailed images of objects or seabed. | Underwater archaeology, pipeline inspection |\n| **Side‑Scan Sonar** | Emits fan‑shaped pulses to image the seafloor side‑by‑side. | Mine detection, wreck surveys |\n| **Multibeam Sonar** | Emits multiple beams at different angles to map bathymetry. | Hydrographic surveys, navigation charts |\n| **Sub‑Bottom Profiling** | Sends sound into the seabed to image layers below the surface. | Geophysical studies, oil & gas exploration |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | What It Tells You | Typical Range |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Frequency** | Determines resolution vs. penetration. | 10 kHz–10 MHz (low for deep penetration, high for fine detail) |\n| **Pulse Length** | Affects range resolution. | 1–100 µs |\n| **Beamwidth** | Angular spread of the transmitted beam. | 1°–30° |\n| **Signal‑to‑Noise Ratio (SNR)** | Quality of echo relative to background. | > 10 dB for reliable detection |\n| **Doppler Shift** | Velocity of moving target. | 0–100 m/s |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Common Applications\n\n| Field | Example |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Naval & Military** | Submarine detection, mine countermeasures, navigation |\n| **Commercial Shipping** | Collision avoidance, underwater obstacle detection |\n| **Fishing & Aquaculture** | Fish finders, stock estimation |\n| **Geology & Oceanography** | Bathymetric mapping, sediment profiling |\n| **Environmental Monitoring** | Tracking marine mammals, studying soundscapes |\n| **Industrial** | Pipeline inspection, offshore drilling |\n| **Scientific Research** | Underwater archaeology, marine biology |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why Sonar Is Useful\n\n- **Transparency in water**: Light is heavily attenuated in water, especially in turbid or deep conditions, whereas sound travels thousands of meters with relatively low loss.\n- **Real‑time feedback**: Sonar can provide immediate information about surroundings, essential for navigation and safety.\n- **Non‑invasive**: No need to physically touch or disturb the environment.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Limitations & Challenges\n\n- **Sound speed variability**: Temperature, salinity, and pressure changes can distort range calculations.\n- **Multipath reflections**: Echoes can bounce off multiple surfaces, complicating interpretation.\n- **Bio‑fouling**: Marine organisms can grow on transducers, reducing sensitivity.\n- **Regulatory restrictions**: Some frequencies or power levels are limited to protect marine life.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSonar is an acoustic “radar” that sends sound waves into a medium, listens for echoes, and uses the returned signals to determine the presence, distance, size, shape, and sometimes the speed of objects or features. Its versatility makes it indispensable in maritime navigation, military operations, scientific research, and commercial industries.",

It is considered a *pain‑processing* or *central sensitization* syndrome, meaning that the nervous system amplifies pain signals.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Features\n\n| Feature | What it looks like |\n|---------|--------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain in at least 4 of 5 body regions (above, below, left, right, front, back) lasting ≥3 months. |\n| **Tender points** | 18 specific spots (e.g., neck, shoulder, elbow, hip) that are painful when pressed. (The 2010/2011 ACR criteria no longer require tender‑point testing, but it can still help.) |\n| **Fatigue** | Persistent, non‑refreshing tiredness that interferes with daily life. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Non‑restorative sleep, insomnia, or frequent awakenings. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Trouble concentrating, memory lapses, and mental sluggishness. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, depression, anxiety, and sometimes autonomic dysfunction (e.g., dizziness, heart palpitations). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How It’s Diagnosed\n\n1. **History & Physical Exam** – The clinician checks for widespread pain, tender points, and associated symptoms.  \n2. **Rule Out Other Conditions** – Blood tests, imaging, or other labs to exclude infections, autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, etc.  \n3. **Diagnostic Criteria** –  \n   * **2010/2011 ACR criteria**: Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥7 **and** symptom severity scale (SSS) ≥5, or WPI 3–6 **and** SSS ≥9, plus symptoms ≥3 months.  \n   * **2020 ACR criteria**: A simpler questionnaire (WPI + SSS) plus a brief pain inventory; no tender‑point exam required.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. What Causes It?\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but several mechanisms are thought to contribute:\n\n| Mechanism | What it means |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **Central sensitization** | The spinal cord and brain become hypersensitive to pain signals. |\n| **Genetic predisposition** | Family history increases risk. |\n| **Neurochemical imbalances** | Altered levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and substance P. |\n| **Sleep disruption** | Poor sleep can worsen pain and fatigue. |\n| **Stress & trauma** | Physical injury, emotional stress, or childhood trauma can trigger or worsen symptoms. |\n| **Hormonal factors** | Some evidence links estrogen fluctuations to symptom severity. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment Approaches\n\n| Category | Typical Interventions | Key Points |\n|----------|-----------------------|------------|\n| **Medications** | • **Pain relievers** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs) – limited benefit. <br>• **Antidepressants** (duloxetine, milnacipran, amitriptyline) – help pain, sleep, mood. <br>• **Anticonvulsants** (gabapentin, pregabalin) – reduce pain and improve sleep. | Medication choice depends on symptom profile and side‑effect tolerance. |\n| **Lifestyle & Self‑Care** | • **Regular aerobic exercise** (walking, swimming, cycling). <br>• **Mind‑body therapies** (yoga, tai chi, meditation). <br>• **Sleep hygiene** (consistent bedtime, dark room, limiting caffeine). <br>• **Stress management** (CBT, relaxation techniques). | Exercise is the single most effective non‑pharmacologic treatment. |\n| **Physical Therapy** | Targeted stretching, strengthening, and manual therapy. | Helps improve function and reduce pain. |\n| **Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** | Addresses pain perception, coping strategies, and mood. | Strong evidence for reducing pain and improving quality of life. |\n| **Complementary Therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, biofeedback, and certain supplements (e.g., magnesium, vitamin D). | Use as adjuncts; evidence varies. |\n| **Support & Education** | Patient education, support groups, and occupational therapy. | Empower patients to manage symptoms. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Living With Fibromyalgia\n\n* **Set realistic goals** – Small, achievable steps reduce frustration.  \n* **Track symptoms** – A pain diary helps identify triggers and effective strategies.  \n* **Prioritize sleep** – Even short naps can help if nighttime sleep is poor.  \n* **Stay connected** – Social support and counseling can mitigate depression/anxiety.  \n* **Regular check‑ins** – Work with a multidisciplinary team (primary care, rheumatology, pain specialist, PT/OT, mental health).  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Take‑aways\n\n1. **Fibromyalgia is a real, chronic condition** that involves widespread pain, fatigue, and many other symptoms.  \n2. **Diagnosis is clinical** – based on symptom patterns and exclusion of other diseases.  \n3. **Treatment is multimodal** – combining medication, exercise, CBT, and lifestyle changes.  \n4. **Individualized care** is essential; what works for one person may not work for another.  \n\nIf you suspect you have fibromyalgia or are experiencing unexplained pain and fatigue, consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.",

      "question": "How much does water weigh ?",
      "system_answer": "**Water’s weight depends on the amount (volume) you’re talking about.**  \nBecause water’s density is essentially constant at ordinary temperatures, you can use the following simple conversions:\n\n| Volume | Mass (weight) | Approximate weight in pounds |\n|--------|---------------|------------------------------|\n| 1 mL (1 cm³) | 1 g | 0.0022 lb |\n| 1 L (1 dm³) | 1 kg | 2.20 lb |\n| 1 m³ (1 km³) | 1 000 kg | 2 200 lb |\n\n**Key points**\n\n1. **Density of pure water**  \n   - At 4 °C (≈39 °F) the density is 1 g / cm³ (or 1 kg / L).  \n   - Slightly higher temperatures (e.g., 20 °C) give a density of about 0.998 g / cm³, which is a negligible difference for everyday use.\n\n2. **Weight vs. mass**  \n   - The numbers above are *mass* (kilograms or grams).  \n   - If you need the *weight* (force due to gravity), multiply by the local gravitational acceleration (≈9.81 m/s²).  \n   - For most everyday contexts, the mass value is what people refer to as “weight.”\n\n3. **Practical example**  \n   - A standard 1‑liter bottle of water (≈33.8 oz) contains about **1 kg** of water, which is roughly **2.2 lb**.\n\nSo, **water weighs about 1 kg per liter (or 1 g per cubic centimeter)**, making it a convenient reference point for many measurements.",

      "question": "Where do apple snails live ?",
      "system_answer": "**Apple snails (family Ampullariidae)** are freshwater snails that are found in a wide range of tropical and subtropical habitats around the world.  Their common name comes from the apple‑shaped shell of many species.  Here’s a quick guide to where they live:\n\n| Habitat | Typical Locations | Key Features |\n|---------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Freshwater bodies** | Rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, swamps, rice paddies, irrigation canals, ditches, and even stagnant water in gardens or backyards. | They need standing or slow‑moving water; they can tolerate a range of water chemistry but prefer slightly acidic to neutral pH. |\n| **Geographic distribution** | • **Native range**: Central and South America, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, and Southeast Asia. <br>• **Introduced**: Many species have been spread worldwide for aquariums, aquaculture, or accidentally via ballast water. They are now common in the southeastern United States, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe. | In introduced areas they can become invasive, outcompeting native snails and altering ecosystems. |\n| **Aquarium and pond settings** | Hobbyists keep species like *Pomacea canaliculata* (golden apple snail) or *Pomacea maculata* (spotted apple snail) in large tanks or outdoor ponds. | They require a good supply of calcium (for shell growth) and a diet of algae, detritus, and sometimes fresh vegetables. |\n| **Agricultural settings** | Rice paddies and other flooded crops. | They feed on rice seedlings and can be a pest, but in some regions they are also harvested for food. |\n\n### Why they thrive\n\n- **Adaptability**: Apple snails can survive in a wide range of temperatures (20–30 °C) and can tolerate low dissolved oxygen because they have a lung‑like structure (aerial respiration) in addition to gills.\n- **Reproduction**: They lay large egg masses on submerged vegetation or on the sides of containers, which helps them colonize new water bodies quickly.\n- **Diet**: They are omnivorous, feeding on algae, detritus, and plant material, which makes them abundant wherever food is available.\n\n### Quick Take‑away\n\nApple snails are **tropical/subtropical freshwater snails** that live in **standing or slow‑moving water**—from natural rivers and lakes to man‑made ponds, rice paddies, and even aquarium tanks.

Below is a quick‑look guide to what plastics are made of, how they’re made, and what they’re made of.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Building Blocks – Monomers\n\n| Monomer | Common polymer it forms | Typical source | Key chemical features |\n|---------|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **Ethylene (C₂H₄)** | Polyethylene (PE) | Crude oil / natural gas | –CH₂–CH₂– repeating |\n| **Propylene (C₃H₆)** | Polypropylene (PP) | Crude oil / natural gas | –CH₂–CH(CH₃)– repeating |\n| **Styrene (C₈H₈)** | Polystyrene (PS) | Crude oil | –CH₂–CH(Ph)– repeating |\n| **Butadiene (C₄H₆)** | Polybutadiene (used in rubber) | Crude oil | –CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂– repeating |\n| **Vinyl chloride (C₂H₃Cl)** | Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) | Crude oil | –CH₂–CHCl– repeating |\n| **Acrylonitrile (C₃H₃N)** | Acrylonitrile‑butadiene‑styrene (ABS) | Crude oil | –CH₂–CH(CN)– repeating |\n| **Methacrylic acid (C₄H₆O₂)** | Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) | Crude oil | –CH₂–C(CH₃)(COOCH₃)– repeating |\n| **Lactic acid (C₃H₆O₃)** | Polylactic acid (PLA) | Fermented sugars (e.g., corn, sugarcane) | –CH₂–C(OH)(COOCH₃)– repeating |\n| **Succinic acid (C₄H₆O₄)** | Polybutylene succinate (PBS) | Fermented sugars | –CH₂–CH₂–COO–COO– repeating |\n\n> **Note:** Many monomers are produced by *cracking* petroleum or natural‑gas liquids, but a growing number are derived from biomass (e.g., lactic acid, succinic acid, 1,3‑butadiene from corn).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Polymerization – Turning Monomers into Polymers\n\n| Polymerization type | Typical monomers | Key catalyst / initiator | Typical conditions |\n|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Chain‑growth (addition)** | Ethylene, propylene, styrene, vinyl chloride | Free‑radical (e.g., benzoyl peroxide), Ziegler–Natta, metallocene | 100–200 °C, 1–10 bar |\n| **Step‑growth (condensation)** | Diols + diacids (e.g., PET), diamines + diacids (e.g., nylon‑6,6) | Acid or base catalyst (e.g., tin octoate, zinc acetate) | 150–250 °C, 1–10 bar |\n| **Ring‑opening** | Lactide (from lactic acid) | Tin octoate | 120–180 °C, 1–5 bar |\n| **Polycondensation** | Polyurethane (diisocyanate + polyol) | Catalyst (e.g., tin, organometallic) | 100–200 °C, 1–5 bar |\n\n> **Result:** A macromolecule (polymer) whose repeating unit is the monomer (or a combination of monomers).  The polymer’s properties (flexibility, melting point, chemical resistance) are set by the monomer chemistry and the polymerization method.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Additives – What Makes a Plastic “Plastic”\n\n| Additive | Purpose | Typical examples |\n|----------|---------|------------------|\n| **Plasticizers** | Increase flexibility | Phthalates, adipates, citrate esters |\n| **Stabilizers** | Protect against heat, UV, oxidation | Tin stabilizers, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) |\n| **Fillers** | Reduce cost, improve mechanical strength | Calcium carbonate, talc, glass fibers |\n| **Pigments / Dyes** | Color | Titanium dioxide (white), carbon black (black) |\n| **Impact modifiers** | Improve toughness | Polybutadiene rubber, EVA |\n| **Flame retardants** | Reduce flammability | Brominated compounds, organophosphates |\n\n> **Result:** The final plastic product is a composite of polymer + additives, tailored for a specific application (e.g., a flexible PVC pipe vs. a rigid PET bottle).\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Typical Plastic Types & Their “Ingredients”\n\n| Plastic | Main polymer | Common monomers | Typical additives |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Low‑density polyethylene (LD‑PE)** | PE | Ethylene | None or minimal |\n| **High‑density polyethylene (HD‑PE)** | PE | Ethylene | None or minimal |\n| **Polypropylene (PP)** | PP | Propylene | None or minimal |\n| **Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)** | PVC | Vinyl chloride | Plasticizers (for flexible PVC), stabilizers |\n| **Polystyrene (PS)** | PS | Styrene | None or minimal |\n| **Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)** | PET | Ethylene glycol + terephthalic acid | None or minimal |\n| **Polyamide (nylon‑6,6)** | Nylon‑6,6 | Hexamethylenediamine + adipic acid | None or minimal |\n| **Polyurethane (PU)** | PU | Diisocyanate + polyol | None or minimal |\n| **Polylactic acid (PLA)** | PLA | Lactic acid | None or minimal |\n| **Polyethylene oxide (PEO)** | PEO | Ethylene oxide | None or minimal |\n\n---\n\n## 5.

The basic definition\n\n- **1 cc = 1 cm³** (a cube 1 cm on each side).  \n- Engine displacement = sum of the swept volumes of all cylinders.  \n- Example: A 4‑cylinder engine with a bore of 80 mm and a stroke of 70 mm has a displacement of about **1 600 cc** (≈ 1.6 L).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How it’s calculated\n\n1. **Bore** = cylinder diameter.  \n2. **Stroke** = distance the piston travels.  \n3. **Swept volume per cylinder** = π × (bore/2)² × stroke.  \n4. **Total displacement** = swept volume × number of cylinders.  \n\n> **Formula**  \n> \\[\n> \\text{Displacement (cc)} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\times \\text{bore}^2 \\times \\text{stroke} \\times \\text{# cylinders}\n> \\]\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Why it matters\n\n| Engine size (cc) | Typical vehicle type | Rough power range (horsepower) | Notes |\n|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| 500–800 cc | Small motorcycles, scooters | 30–70 hp | Lightweight, good fuel economy. |\n| 1 000–1 500 cc | Mid‑size motorcycles, compact cars | 70–120 hp | Balance of power and efficiency. |\n| 1 500–2 500 cc | Sports cars, larger cars | 120–250 hp | More torque, higher performance. |\n| 2 500–4 000 cc | V‑6, V‑8 engines | 200–400 hp | High power, often in performance or luxury cars. |\n| 4 000+ cc | Heavy‑duty trucks, big V‑8s | 300–600 hp | Designed for torque and durability. |\n\n> **Key point:** Larger displacement generally allows more air/fuel mixture → more power, but it also means more weight and often lower fuel efficiency.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Common conversions\n\n| cc | Liters (L) | Cubic inches (ci) |\n|----|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 000 cc | 1.0 L | 61.0 ci |\n| 1 600 cc | 1.6 L | 97.6 ci |\n| 2 000 cc | 2.0 L | 122.0 ci |\n| 3 000 cc | 3.0 L | 183.0 ci |\n| 4 000 cc | 4.0 L | 244.0 ci |\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Is “cc” the same as “cubic inches”?** | No. 1 cc ≈ 0.061 ci. |\n| **Do all engines use cc?** | Mostly in the U.S. and Europe. In Japan, “cc” is common for motorcycles; in the U.S., “cubic inches” is still used for some older cars. |\n| **Does a higher cc always mean more power?** | Not necessarily. Engine design, compression ratio, fuel type, and tuning also matter. |\n| **What about “cc” in other contexts?** | In automotive, “cc” almost always means cubic centimeters of displacement. It can also mean “cubic centimeters” in other fields (e.g., medical imaging, chemistry). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n**CC** is a metric unit that tells you the total internal volume of an engine’s cylinders. It’s the standard way to describe engine size, and it’s a good first‑order indicator of how much power an engine can produce.",

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": "### Ulcer – a quick‑reference guide\n\n| Term | What it means |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Ulcer** | A break or sore that develops in the lining of an organ (most commonly the stomach or small intestine) where the protective mucous layer is damaged, exposing the underlying tissue. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Where ulcers most often occur\n\n| Organ | Typical ulcer type | Common cause |\n|-------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Stomach** | *Gastric ulcer* | H. pylori infection, NSAID use, stress, smoking |\n| **Duodenum (first part of small intestine)** | *Duodenal ulcer* | H. pylori, NSAIDs, smoking, alcohol |\n| **Esophagus** | *Barrett’s esophagus* (pre‑ulcer) → *esophageal ulcer* | Chronic gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) |\n| **Other** | *Peptic ulcer disease* (includes stomach & duodenum) | Same as above |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How an ulcer forms\n\n1. **Protective barrier** – The stomach lining secretes mucus and bicarbonate to neutralize acid.  \n2. **Disruption** – Factors such as *Helicobacter pylori* bacteria, non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excessive acid, or stress can erode this barrier.  \n3. **Exposure** – Acid and digestive enzymes reach the underlying tissue, causing a sore (ulcer).  \n\n---\n\n## 3.  Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Epigastric pain** | Burning or gnawing pain 2–3 hrs after eating (duodenal) or 4–6 hrs after eating (gastric) |\n| **Heartburn / acid reflux** | Burning behind the sternum, especially at night |\n| **Nausea / vomiting** | May be mild or severe |\n| **Loss of appetite / early satiety** | Feeling full quickly |\n| **Weight loss** | Due to reduced food intake |\n| **Dark or tarry stools** | Indicates bleeding ulcer |\n| **Vomiting blood** | Bright red or coffee‑ground appearance |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Upper endoscopy (EGD)** | Direct visualization, biopsy for H. pylori |\n| **Urea breath test** | Detects H. pylori infection |\n| **Stool antigen test** | H. pylori presence |\n| **Blood tests** | Anemia, infection markers |\n| **Imaging (CT, MRI)** | Rarely needed unless complications suspected |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Treatment\n\n| Goal | Typical approach |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Eradicate H. pylori** | Triple therapy: 2 antibiotics + proton‑pump inhibitor (PPI) for 10–14 days |\n| **Reduce acid** | PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole) or H₂ blockers |\n| **Protect the mucosa** | Sucralfate, misoprostol (especially in NSAID‑related ulcers) |\n| **Address lifestyle** | Avoid NSAIDs, limit alcohol, quit smoking, reduce stress |\n| **Surgery** | Rarely needed; reserved for perforation, uncontrolled bleeding, or malignancy suspicion |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Prevention\n\n| Strategy | Why it helps |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Avoid NSAIDs or use protective agents** | NSAIDs are a major ulcer trigger |\n| **Treat H. pylori promptly** | Infection is the most common cause |\n| **Limit alcohol & caffeine** | Irritate the stomach lining |\n| **Quit smoking** | Reduces mucosal protection |\n| **Manage stress** | Stress hormones can increase acid production |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAn ulcer is a sore that forms when the protective lining of the stomach or small intestine is damaged, most often by *H. pylori* infection or NSAID use. It causes burning pain, can bleed, and is treatable with antibiotics, acid‑reducing medication, and lifestyle changes. If you suspect an ulcer, seek medical evaluation—especially if you notice vomiting blood or black stools.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "### Compound Interest – the “interest on interest” you earn (or owe)\n\n| Concept | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Compound interest** | Interest that is calculated on the original principal **plus** any interest that has already accumulated. |\n| **Simple interest** | Interest calculated only on the original principal, never on the interest that has been added. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The basic formula\n\nFor a principal amount \\(P\\) invested (or borrowed) at an annual nominal rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 5 % → 0.05) that is compounded \\(n\\) times per year, the amount \\(A\\) after \\(t\\) years is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(P\\)** – initial principal (e.g., \\$1,000)  \n- **\\(r\\)** – annual interest rate (decimal)  \n- **\\(n\\)** – number of compounding periods per year (12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly, 1 for yearly, 365 for daily)  \n- **\\(t\\)** – number of years  \n\nThe **interest earned** is \\(A - P\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why it matters\n\n- **Interest on interest**: Each time interest is added to the balance, the next period’s interest is calculated on a larger base.  \n- **Growth is exponential**: Over time, the effect of compounding can be dramatic, especially with higher rates or more frequent compounding.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Quick examples\n\n| Scenario | \\(P\\) | \\(r\\) | \\(n\\) | \\(t\\) | Final amount \\(A\\) | Interest earned |\n|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| 1. 5 % annual, compounded yearly for 3 yrs | \\$1,000 | 0.05 | 1 | 3 | \\$1,157.63 | \\$157.63 |\n| 2. 5 % annual, compounded monthly for 3 yrs | \\$1,000 | 0.05 | 12 | 3 | \\$1,161.62 | \\$161.62 |\n| 3. 5 % annual, compounded daily for 3 yrs | \\$1,000 | 0.05 | 365 | 3 | \\$1,161.83 | \\$161.83 |\n\n> **Take‑away**: More frequent compounding (monthly vs. yearly) yields slightly more interest, but the difference is modest for short periods. Over decades, the effect becomes larger.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Continuous compounding\n\nWhen compounding happens an infinite number of times per year, the formula becomes\n\n\\[\nA = P\\,e^{rt}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\).  \nThis is the limit of the discrete compounding formula as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Common real‑world uses\n\n| Application | How compounding works |\n|-------------|-----------------------|\n| **Savings accounts** | Banks often compound monthly or daily. |\n| **Retirement accounts (401(k), IRA)** | Contributions grow with compound interest over decades. |\n| **Mortgages** | Interest is compounded monthly on the remaining balance. |\n| **Loans** | The debt grows with compound interest if payments are insufficient. |\n| **Investment funds** | Returns are reinvested, compounding the portfolio. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Practical tips\n\n| Tip | Why it helps |\n|-----|--------------|\n| **Start early** | Even a small amount grows significantly over time. |\n| **Reinvest dividends** | Turning dividends into additional shares compounds returns. |\n| **Choose higher compounding frequency** | If you can, pick accounts that compound monthly or daily. |\n| **Watch fees** | High fees can erode the benefit of compounding. |\n| **Avoid high‑interest debt** | Compounding on debt can quickly outpace your savings. |\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Quick “cheat sheet”\n\n| Rate | Years | Principal | Final (annual compounding) | Final (monthly compounding) |\n|------|-------|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 3 % | 10 | \\$5,000 | \\$6,232 | \\$6,242 |\n| 5 % | 20 | \\$10,000 | \\$26,532 | \\$26,590 |\n| 7 % | 30 | \\$15,000 | \\$73,000 | \\$73,400 |\n\n*(Numbers rounded to nearest dollar.)*\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nCompound interest is the mechanism that lets money grow faster than simple interest by adding interest to the principal repeatedly. The key variables are the rate, the frequency of compounding, and the time horizon. Understanding and leveraging compounding can make a huge difference in savings, investments, and debt management.",

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": "### Hybridization – the “mix‑and‑match” of atomic orbitals\n\n| Concept | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Hybridization** | The mathematical combination of two or more atomic orbitals (s, p, d, …) on the same atom to form new, equivalent “hybrid” orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in a molecule. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why we need hybridization\n\n- **Molecular geometry**: The shapes of molecules (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal planar, linear) are governed by the spatial arrangement of bonds.  \n- **Bonding orbitals**: Real molecules are not described well by pure s or p orbitals alone; hybrid orbitals give the correct directionality and overlap.  \n- **Predicting reactivity**: Hybridization influences bond strength, polarity, and the ability of atoms to participate in reactions.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The basic hybrid orbitals\n\n| Hybrid type | Composition | Geometry | Example |\n|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, CO₂ |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, C₆H₆ (in the ring) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n> **Note**: The “d” orbitals involved in sp³d and sp³d² are usually the 3d orbitals of the central atom (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur).\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How hybridization works (step‑by‑step)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count its **electron pairs** (bonding + lone pairs).  \n2. **Determine the steric number** (total electron pairs).  \n3. **Match the steric number to a hybrid type** (sp, sp², sp³, etc.).  \n4. **Assign hybrid orbitals** to each bond or lone pair.  \n5. **Draw the geometry** using the hybrid orbitals as axes.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n| Step | Action | Result |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Carbon has 4 valence electrons → 4 bonding pairs. | Steric number = 4 |\n| 2 | 4 → sp³ hybridization. | 4 sp³ orbitals, each 109.5° apart |\n| 3 | Each sp³ orbital overlaps with an H 1s orbital. | Four C–H σ bonds |\n| 4 | Geometry: tetrahedral. | CH₄ is a perfect tetrahedron. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Hybridization vs. “pure” orbitals\n\n| Pure orbital | Directionality | Overlap with H 1s |\n|--------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| 2pₓ | 90° to 2pᵧ, 2p𝓏 | Poor overlap (only along axis) |\n| 2pᵧ | 90° to 2pₓ, 2p𝓏 | Poor overlap |\n| 2p𝓏 | 90° to 2pₓ, 2pᵧ | Poor overlap |\n\nHybrid orbitals (sp³) are **equal mixtures** of s and p, giving **four equivalent lobes** that point directly toward the hydrogen atoms, maximizing overlap and bond strength.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Hybridization in other contexts (quick note)\n\n| Field | Hybridization meaning |\n|-------|-----------------------|\n| **Genetics** | Mixing of alleles from two parents (hybrid organisms). |\n| **Linguistics** | Combining features of two languages (hybrid language). |\n| **Computing** | Combining two data structures or algorithms. |\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Quick “cheat sheet”\n\n| Steric number | Hybrid type | Geometry | Typical bond angles |\n|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|\n| 2 | sp | Linear | 180° |\n| 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 120° |\n| 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n| 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 90° |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a conceptual tool that lets chemists explain why molecules have the shapes they do.

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": "### How fast does alcohol get into the bloodstream?\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical time / rate |\n|------|--------------|---------------------|\n| **Ingestion** | You drink a beverage (beer, wine, spirits, cocktails, etc.). | 0 min (the moment you swallow) |\n| **Stomach** | 20–30 % of the alcohol is absorbed here, mainly through the stomach lining. | 5–15 min (depends on gastric emptying) |\n| **Small intestine** | The bulk (≈ 70–80 %) of the alcohol is absorbed across the intestinal wall into the portal vein. | 15–45 min |\n| **Portal circulation → liver** | Alcohol first passes through the liver (first‑pass metabolism). About 15–20 % is metabolized before it reaches the rest of the body. | 0–30 min |\n| **Systemic circulation** | The remaining alcohol enters the bloodstream and distributes to tissues. | 30–90 min after drinking |\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | The highest BAC you’ll reach after a single drink. | 30–90 min (often 45–60 min) |\n| **Rate of absorption** | Roughly 0.1–0.2 g of ethanol per kilogram of body weight per hour for a typical adult. | 7–14 g per hour for a 70 kg person |\n| **Typical rise in BAC** | 1 standard drink (≈ 14 g ethanol) → ~0.02–0.03 % BAC peak. | 30–60 min |\n\n> **Key takeaway:** 90 % of the alcohol you drink is absorbed within the first hour, and the peak concentration is usually reached 30–90 minutes after consumption.\n\n---\n\n## Why the timing matters\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑proof drinks (spirits) reach the bloodstream faster because more ethanol is present per volume. |\n| **Presence of food** | A full stomach slows gastric emptying → slower absorption. Fatty meals can delay peak BAC by 30–60 min. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Heavier people have more body water → lower peak BAC for the same dose. Women generally reach higher BACs because of lower body water and often lower alcohol‑dehydrogenase activity. |\n| **Metabolism** | Genetic variants in ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) and ALDH (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) can speed or slow the breakdown of alcohol. |\n| **Drinking speed** | Rapid consumption (e.g., “chugging”) can overwhelm the liver’s capacity to metabolize, leading to a higher peak BAC. |\n| **Other substances** | Caffeine, certain medications, or other drugs can alter gastric emptying or enzyme activity, affecting absorption. |\n| **Health status** | Liver disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or medications that inhibit ADH can change the absorption/elimination balance. |\n\n---\n\n## Absorption vs. elimination\n\n| Process | Typical rate | What it means for you |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| **Absorption** | 0.1–0.2 g/kg h (≈ 7–14 g/h for a 70 kg adult) | How fast alcohol enters the bloodstream. |\n| **Metabolism (elimination)** | ~0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour (≈ 0.1–0.2 g/kg h) | How fast the body clears alcohol. |\n| **Net effect** | If you drink faster than you metabolize, BAC rises. If you drink slower, BAC may plateau or even fall. | Your intoxication level depends on the balance of these two rates. |\n\n---\n\n## Practical examples\n\n| Drink | Volume | Alcohol % | Approx. time to peak BAC | Approx. peak BAC |\n|-------|--------|-----------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| 12 oz beer (5 %) | 355 mL | 5 % | 45–60 min | 0.02–0.03 % |\n| 5 oz wine (12 %) | 148 mL | 12 % | 30–45 min | 0.03–0.04 % |\n| 1.5 oz spirit (40 %) | 44 mL | 40 % | 20–30 min | 0.04–0.05 % |\n| Mixed cocktail (2 oz spirit + 4 oz mixer) | 6 oz | 20–30 % | 30–45 min | 0.03–0.04 % |\n\n> **Tip:** If you’re planning to drive or perform a task that requires full alertness, give yourself at least 90 minutes after a drink before you’re likely to be at peak intoxication.\n\n---\n\n## Quick “cheat sheet”\n\n| What you want to know | Answer |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| **How long until alcohol shows up in my blood?** | 5–15 min in the stomach, 15–45 min in the intestine, peak BAC 30–90 min after drinking. |\n| **How fast is it absorbed?** | Roughly 0.1–0.2 g/kg h (≈ 7–14 g/h for a 70 kg adult). |\n| **Does food slow it down?** | Yes—especially fatty meals; can delay peak BAC by 30–60 min. |\n| **Do spirits get absorbed faster?** | Higher‑proof drinks reach the bloodstream quicker because they contain more ethanol per volume. |\n| **What’s the difference between absorption and elimination?** | Absorption is how fast alcohol enters the blood; elimination is how fast the liver clears it (≈ 0.015–0.020 % BAC per hour). |\n| **When is my BAC likely to be highest?** | 30–90 min after the start of drinking, depending on dose, food, and individual factors. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAlcohol is absorbed very quickly—most of it is in your bloodstream within an hour. The exact timing depends on how much you drink, how fast you drink it, what’s in your stomach, and your own physiology. Knowing these dynamics helps you make safer choices and understand how long it might take for you to feel the effects or to clear the alcohol from your system.",

      "system_answer": "**Ideal refrigerator temperature**\n\n| Compartment | Recommended temperature | Why it matters |\n|-------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| **Refrigerator (fresh‑food section)** | **35 °F – 38 °F** (≈ 1.7 °C – 3.3 °C) | Keeps perishable foods (dairy, meats, produce) below the 40 °F threshold that slows bacterial growth. |\n| **Freezer** | **0 °F** (≈ –18 °C) | Keeps foods frozen solid, preventing spoilage and maintaining texture. |\n\n---\n\n### Why 35–38 °F is the sweet spot\n\n| Factor | Effect |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Food safety** | Bacteria multiply rapidly above 40 °F. Staying below 38 °F keeps the fridge in the “safe zone.” |\n| **Energy efficiency** | Setting the fridge too cold (e.g., 30 °F) wastes energy and can cause food to freeze or become overly dry. |\n| **Food quality** | 35–38 °F preserves texture, flavor, and nutrients without over‑cooling. |\n| **Door temperature** | The door is the warmest part; a 35–38 °F setting keeps the interior cool even when the door is opened frequently. |\n\n---\n\n### How to check and maintain the right temperature\n\n1. **Use a reliable thermometer**  \n   - Place a digital or analog fridge thermometer in the middle of the main compartment (not in a corner or near the door).  \n   - Let it sit for 24 hours before reading.\n\n2. **Adjust the thermostat**  \n   - Most modern fridges have a dial or digital control.  \n   - Turn the dial **up** (toward “cold”) if the temperature is above 38 °F; **down** (toward “warm”) if below 35 °F.\n\n3. **Keep the fridge full, but not packed**  \n   - A full fridge retains cold better, but overcrowding blocks air circulation. Aim for 70–80 % capacity.\n\n4. **Avoid placing hot foods directly in the fridge**  \n   - Let hot items cool to room temperature first; otherwise the fridge works harder and may over‑cool.\n\n5. **Check the door seal**  \n   - A faulty seal lets warm air in, raising the interior temperature. Clean the gasket and replace if damaged.\n\n6. **Regularly defrost (if manual)**  \n   - For manual‑defrost models, keep the freezer at 0 °F and the fridge at 35–38 °F. Automatic‑defrost units handle this automatically.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference\n\n| Temperature | What it means for your fridge |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Below 30 °F** | Too cold – risk of freezing or drying out foods. |\n| **30–34 °F** | Slightly cold – still safe but may cause some foods to freeze. |\n| **35–38 °F** | **Optimal** – safe, efficient, and preserves quality. |\n| **39–40 °F** | Borderline – still safe but bacteria grow faster; consider cooling a bit. |\n| **Above 40 °F** | Unsafe – bacteria multiply quickly; food may spoil. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nSet your refrigerator to **35 °F–38 °F** (1.7 °C–3.3 °C). This keeps food safe, preserves quality, and balances energy use. Check the temperature regularly, keep the fridge well‑organized, and maintain a good door seal for consistent performance.",

      "system_answer": "**The Statue of Liberty is a composite structure made of several materials, each chosen for its specific properties:**\n\n| Layer / Component | Material | Purpose / Key Details |\n|-------------------|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Exterior skin** | **Copper** (≈ 6 tons) | Gives the statue its iconic green patina (verdigris) through natural oxidation. Copper is lightweight, malleable, and corrosion‑resistant. |\n| **Internal skeleton** | **Wrought‑iron** (originally) | The original internal framework was built from wrought‑iron ribs and a central core. Wrought iron was chosen for its ductility and ability to be forged into the complex shapes needed. |\n| **Structural reinforcement** | **Steel** (added later) | In the 1970s, the original iron framework was reinforced with a steel skeleton to improve stability and reduce weight. The steel is hidden beneath the copper skin. |\n| **Foundation** | **Concrete & stone** | The statue sits on a concrete base that rests on a granite foundation. |\n| **Other components** | **Glass, wood, and various metals** | The torch, crown, and other decorative elements use additional metals (e.g., bronze for the torch’s flame). The interior contains a wooden staircase and a steel elevator. |\n\n### How it all fits together\n\n1. **Copper skin**:  The outer layer is about 2.4 mm thick and was hammered into shape by artisans.  \n2. **Iron ribs**:  These ribs form the “skeleton” that supports the copper skin.  \n3. **Steel armature**:  Added in the 1970s to replace corroded iron and to provide extra strength.  \n4. **Concrete base**:  Holds the statue upright and anchors it to the island’s bedrock.\n\n### Quick facts\n\n- **Total weight**: ~ 225 tons (≈ 204 metric tons).  \n- **Height**: 151 ft (46 m) from base to torch tip.  \n- **Copper area**: ~ 12,000 sq ft (≈ 1,100 m²).  \n\nSo, the Statue of Liberty is primarily **copper** on the outside, supported by an **iron/steel framework**, and anchored by a **concrete/stone foundation**.",

      "question": "What is solar wind ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous, supersonic outflow of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—from the Sun’s outer atmosphere (the corona). It streams outward through the entire solar system, carrying with it the Sun’s magnetic field and influencing planetary environments, space weather, and interplanetary space.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What it is\n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Composition** | ~ 95 % protons (hydrogen nuclei), ~ 4 % electrons, ~ 1 % alpha particles (helium nuclei) and trace heavier ions (e.g., O⁶⁺, Fe⁶⁺). |\n| **Origin** | Heated coronal plasma expands because its thermal pressure exceeds the Sun’s gravitational pull. |\n| **Speed** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ (≈ 1,000–3,000 mi s⁻¹). Two main regimes: “slow wind” (~ 400 km s⁻¹) and “fast wind” (~ 800 km s⁻¹). |\n| **Density** | ~ 5–10 particles cm⁻³ at 1 AU (Earth’s orbit). |\n| **Temperature** | 1–3 million K in the corona; the wind cools as it expands but remains hot (~ 10⁵ K at 1 AU). |\n| **Magnetic field** | Carries the Sun’s magnetic field outward, forming the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How it’s generated\n\n1. **Coronal heating** – The Sun’s corona is heated to millions of kelvin by mechanisms still under study (wave heating, magnetic reconnection, nanoflares).  \n2. **Pressure gradient** – Hot plasma has high thermal pressure; the pressure gradient forces it to expand outward.  \n3. **Magnetic field geometry** – Open magnetic field lines (e.g., in coronal holes) allow plasma to escape freely, producing the fast wind. Closed loops trap plasma, leading to the slower wind.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key characteristics\n\n| Property | Typical Value | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| **Velocity** | 300–800 km s⁻¹ | Fast wind originates from coronal holes near the poles; slow wind from the equatorial belt. |\n| **Mass flux** | ~ 10¹⁴ kg day⁻¹ | Equivalent to ~ 1 kg of water per second. |\n| **Variability** | Solar cycle (≈ 11 yr) | Solar maximum → more coronal holes → higher fast‑wind fraction; solar minimum → more slow wind. |\n| **Interaction with planets** | Magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras | Solar wind pressure compresses Earth’s magnetosphere; reconnection drives geomagnetic storms. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why it matters\n\n| Impact | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Space weather** | Solar wind fluctuations can trigger geomagnetic storms, disrupting satellites, GPS, power grids, and radio communications. |\n| **Planetary atmospheres** | Solar wind erosion shapes the atmospheres of Mars and Venus; it also drives auroras on Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, etc. |\n| **Heliosphere** | The solar wind creates the heliosphere—a bubble of solar plasma that shields the solar system from interstellar medium. |\n| **Astrophysical laboratory** | Studying the solar wind helps us understand stellar winds from other stars, stellar evolution, and plasma physics. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Observations & Missions\n\n| Mission | Contribution |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Parker Solar Probe** | First spacecraft to approach the Sun’s corona (≤ 0.07 AU), measuring wind speed, density, and magnetic fields. |\n| **Solar Orbiter** | Provides simultaneous remote sensing and in‑situ measurements of the solar wind and coronal magnetic fields. |\n| **ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer)** | Near‑Earth orbit; monitors solar wind parameters and composition for space‑weather forecasting. |\n| **Wind, SOHO, STEREO** | Long‑term monitoring of solar wind speed, density, and IMF. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick “Did‑you‑know” facts\n\n- The solar wind travels at ~ 400 km s⁻¹, so it takes ~ 4 days to reach Earth from the Sun.  \n- The “solar wind speed” is often measured by the Doppler shift of the solar wind’s plasma emission lines.  \n- The solar wind’s magnetic field can reconnect with Earth’s magnetic field, releasing huge amounts of energy (geomagnetic storms).  \n- The heliopause—the boundary where the solar wind meets the interstellar medium—was crossed by Voyager 1 in 2012.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n**Solar wind is a hot, charged plasma stream flowing from the Sun’s corona, carrying the Sun’s magnetic field through the solar system.** It shapes planetary magnetospheres, drives space weather, and provides a natural laboratory for studying plasma physics and stellar winds.",

Advantages\n\n- **Renewable & abundant**: Sunlight is free and globally available.\n- **Low operating cost**: No fuel, minimal maintenance.\n- **Scalable**: From pocket‑sized panels to megawatt‑scale farms.\n- **Environmentally friendly**: No greenhouse gas emissions during operation.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Limitations\n\n- **Intermittency**: Only generate power during daylight; weather‑dependent.\n- **Energy density**: Requires large surface area for significant power output.\n- **Material concerns**: Some thin‑film cells use toxic or scarce elements (Cd, Te, In, Ga).\n- **Degradation**: Efficiency can drop over 20–30 years (typically 0.5–1 %/year).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Typical Applications\n\n| Application | Scale | Example |\n|-------------|-------|---------|\n| **Residential** | Small to medium | Rooftop panels, ground‑mounted arrays |\n| **Commercial** | Medium | Building‑integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), parking‑lot canopies |\n| **Utility‑scale** | Large | Solar farms, hybrid solar‑wind plants |\n| **Portable** | Tiny | Solar chargers, solar backpacks |\n| **Space** | Very small | Satellite power, space probes |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Future Trends\n\n- **Tandem cells** (e.g., perovskite/Si) pushing efficiencies > 30 %.  \n- **Flexible & lightweight** materials for wearables and building skins.  \n- **Advanced encapsulation** to extend lifetimes beyond 30 years.  \n- **Grid‑integration** with storage (batteries, pumped hydro) to mitigate intermittency.  \n- **Cost reductions** through roll‑to‑roll manufacturing and economies of scale.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSolar cells are semiconductor devices that transform sunlight into electricity via the photovoltaic effect.

Why Employers Offer Severance\n\n| Reason | How it Helps |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Legal compliance** | Meets statutory or collective‑bargaining requirements (e.g., WARN Act in the U.S.). |\n| **Reputation management** | Shows goodwill, reducing negative word‑of‑mouth and protecting employer brand. |\n| **Employee morale** | Eases the transition for remaining staff, reducing anxiety about job security. |\n| **Avoiding litigation** | Reduces the risk of wrongful‑termination or discrimination lawsuits. |\n| **Retention of talent** | Allows key employees to leave on good terms, preserving future referrals. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Common Legal Frameworks (U.S. examples)\n\n| Law | What it Covers |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **WARN Act (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act)** | Requires 60‑day notice for mass layoffs (50+ employees in a 30‑day period). Severance is not mandated but often provided. |\n| **State laws** | Some states (e.g., California, New York) have additional notice or severance requirements for certain layoffs. |\n| **Collective‑bargaining agreements** | Union contracts may specify severance formulas. |\n| **Employment contracts** | Individual agreements can stipulate severance terms. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Typical Severance Formula\n\n| Formula | Example |\n|---------|---------|\n| **“X weeks of pay per year of service”** | 1 week per year of service (e.g., 5 years → 5 weeks). |\n| **“Fixed amount”** | $5,000 regardless of tenure. |\n| **“Combination”** | Base pay + accrued leave payout + benefits continuation. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. How It’s Calculated\n\n1. **Determine base salary** (weekly or monthly).  \n2. **Apply the severance multiplier** (e.g., 1 week per year).  \n3. **Add accrued leave** (if applicable).  \n4. **Include any additional benefits** (e.g., health‑care continuation).  \n5. **Subtract any deductions** (taxes, garnishments, or company‑specific withholdings).  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Practical Tips for Employees\n\n| Tip | Why it matters |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **Read the offer carefully** | Confirm the amount, payment schedule, and any conditions (e.g., signing a release). |\n| **Ask about benefits** | Clarify how long health coverage will continue and whether you can transfer it. |\n| **Check tax implications** | Severance is taxable; plan for withholding and potential tax brackets. |\n| **Negotiate** | If the offer seems low, you can negotiate for a higher payout or extended benefits. |\n| **Seek legal advice** | Especially if you suspect discrimination or breach of contract. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Bottom Line\n\nSeverance pay is a **voluntary or contractual payment** that helps employees transition after job loss. While not universally required, it serves as a safety net, a goodwill gesture, and a risk‑management tool for employers. The specifics—amount, duration, and accompanying benefits—vary widely depending on company policy, legal requirements, and individual agreements.",

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": "**Semiconductors** are materials whose ability to conduct electricity lies between that of conductors (like copper) and insulators (like glass). Their electrical properties can be precisely controlled, making them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Makes a Semiconductor Special?\n\n| Property | Why It Matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Bandgap** | A small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can be excited across this gap with modest energy (light, heat, or an electric field). |\n| **Doping** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (donors or acceptors) creates free charge carriers (electrons or holes), turning the material into an *n‑type* or *p‑type* semiconductor. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite of metals), allowing temperature‑sensitive devices. |\n| **Crystal structure** | A regular lattice (e.g., silicon’s diamond cubic) provides predictable electronic behavior. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Semiconductor Materials\n\n| Material | Typical Use | Bandgap (eV) | Notes |\n|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Integrated circuits, solar cells | 1.12 | Most widely used; mature fabrication technology. |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | High‑speed transistors, fiber‑optic detectors | 0.66 | Good carrier mobility; less common in mainstream ICs. |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | RF/microwave devices, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 | Direct bandgap → efficient light emission. |\n| **Indium Phosphide (InP)** | High‑power lasers, optical communications | 1.35 | Excellent for high‑frequency, high‑power devices. |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 3.26 | Extremely wide bandgap → high breakdown voltage. |\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power transistors, RF | 3.4 | Direct bandgap; high electron mobility. |\n| **Perovskites (e.g., MAPbI₃)** | Emerging solar cells | 1.5 | Cheap, high‑efficiency, but stability issues. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Semiconductors Work (Basic Device Concepts)\n\n### 3.1 p‑n Junction\n\n- **p‑type**: Excess holes (positive charge carriers).  \n- **n‑type**: Excess electrons (negative charge carriers).  \n- When brought together, an **electric field** forms at the interface, creating a depletion region that allows current to flow only in one direction (diode behavior).\n\n### 3.2 Transistor (MOSFET, BJT)\n\n- **MOSFET**: Uses a gate voltage to control a channel of electrons or holes between source and drain.  \n- **BJT**: Uses a small base current to control a larger collector–emitter current.  \n- Both rely on precise doping and thin insulating layers to achieve amplification and switching.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why Semiconductors Matter\n\n| Application | Why Semiconductors Are Essential |\n|-------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Computing** | Transistors switch billions of times per second, enabling CPUs, GPUs, memory. |\n| **Communication** | RF transceivers, modulators, and antennas rely on high‑frequency semiconductor devices. |\n| **Energy** | Solar cells convert sunlight to electricity; power electronics control electric vehicles and renewable grids. |\n| **Sensors** | Photodiodes, thermistors, and MEMS use semiconductor physics for detection. |\n| **Consumer Electronics** | Smartphones, TVs, cameras—all built on semiconductor chips. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Performance Metrics\n\n| Metric | What It Measures | Typical Values |\n|--------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Carrier mobility** | Speed of electrons/holes | Si: ~1400 cm²/V·s (electrons) |\n| **Breakdown voltage** | Maximum reverse bias before avalanche | SiC: > 10 kV |\n| **On‑resistance (R<sub>on</sub>)** | Resistance when device is “on” | Si MOSFET: < 10 mΩ·mm² |\n| **Threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>)** | Gate voltage needed to turn on | Si MOSFET: 0.5–1 V |\n| **Bandgap (E<sub>g</sub>)** | Energy needed to excite carriers | Si: 1.12 eV |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Future Trends\n\n- **Wide‑bandgap materials** (SiC, GaN) for higher‑power, higher‑frequency devices.  \n- **2D semiconductors** (MoS₂, WS₂) for flexible, transparent electronics.  \n- **Perovskite solar cells** approaching 25 % efficiency with low‑cost processing.  \n- **Quantum‑dot and nanowire transistors** for ultra‑scaled logic.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are engineered materials whose controlled electrical conductivity enables the creation of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits—foundations of all modern electronic devices. Their unique band structure, tunable via doping and temperature, allows precise manipulation of charge carriers, making them indispensable for computing, communications, energy, and sensing technologies.",

      "system_answer": "A **thermometer** is a device that measures temperature—the degree of heat or cold in a substance or environment. It works by converting a physical change that occurs with temperature (such as expansion, electrical resistance, or color change) into a readable scale.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Principle\n\n| Type | How it works | Typical scale |\n|------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Liquid‑filled** (mercury or alcohol) | Liquid expands/contract with temperature; the change in height is read on a calibrated scale. | °C (Celsius) or °F (Fahrenheit) |\n| **Thermocouple** | Two dissimilar metals joined at one end produce a voltage proportional to temperature. | °C, °F, or Kelvin (via conversion) |\n| **Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD)** | Electrical resistance of a metal (usually platinum) changes predictably with temperature. | °C, °F, Kelvin |\n| **Infrared (IR)** | Measures emitted infrared radiation; temperature is inferred from the spectrum. | °C, °F, Kelvin |\n| **Bimetallic strip** | Two metals with different expansion rates bend with temperature; the bend is read by a pointer. | °C, °F |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Components\n\n1. **Sensing element** – the part that reacts to temperature (liquid, metal, semiconductor, etc.).  \n2. **Transducer** – converts the physical change into a measurable signal (voltage, resistance, displacement).  \n3. **Display/reading mechanism** – a calibrated scale, digital readout, or indicator.  \n4. **Housing** – protects the sensor and ensures accurate measurement (often insulated or shielded).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common Uses\n\n| Field | Typical Thermometer | Why it’s chosen |\n|-------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| **Medicine** | Digital or mercury‑free probe | Fast, accurate, safe for body contact |\n| **Cooking** | Infrared or probe | Non‑contact or precise internal temperature |\n| **Industrial** | RTD or thermocouple | High‑temperature, rugged, long‑term stability |\n| **Weather** | Bimetallic or digital | Easy to read, robust for outdoor use |\n| **Scientific research** | Cryogenic or high‑precision RTDs | Extremely low or high temperatures, high accuracy |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Accuracy & Calibration\n\n- **Accuracy** is the closeness of the reading to the true temperature.  \n- **Calibration** involves comparing the thermometer to a known standard (e.g., ice‑water point at 0 °C, boiling water at 100 °C).  \n- **Drift** can occur over time; periodic recalibration ensures reliability.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Safety Note\n\n- **Mercury thermometers** contain toxic mercury; they should be handled with care and disposed of according to hazardous‑waste regulations.  \n- Modern alternatives (digital, alcohol, or non‑mercury liquid) are preferred for safety and environmental reasons.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA thermometer is a measurement instrument that translates a temperature‑dependent physical change into a readable value, enabling us to quantify heat in everything from a human body to industrial furnaces.",

Why Mold Matters\n\n| Issue | Impact |\n|-------|--------|\n| **Health** | Allergic reactions, asthma, respiratory irritation, and in rare cases, toxic mold syndrome (especially with *Stachybotrys*). |\n| **Structural damage** | Weakens wood, drywall, insulation, and can cause rot or corrosion. |\n| **Odor** | Musty, earthy smell that can permeate a home. |\n| **Property value** | Visible mold can reduce resale value and require costly remediation. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prevention & Control\n\n1. **Control moisture**  \n   - Fix leaks, use dehumidifiers (target 30–50 % RH).  \n   - Ensure proper ventilation (exhaust fans, open windows).  \n   - Insulate pipes and walls to prevent condensation.\n\n2. **Clean up promptly**  \n   - Remove water sources (spills, floods).  \n   - Dry wet areas within 24–48 h.\n\n3. **Use mold‑resistant materials**  \n   - Mold‑resistant drywall, paint, and insulation in high‑humidity areas.\n\n4. **Regular inspections**  \n   - Check bathrooms, basements, crawl spaces, and HVAC systems for early signs.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Removal\n\n| Step | What to Do |\n|------|------------|\n| **Safety first** | Wear gloves, goggles, and a N95 respirator. |\n| **Contain the area** | Seal off the space with plastic sheeting if mold is extensive. |\n| **Clean non‑porous surfaces** | Use detergent + water or a commercial mold cleaner. |\n| **Disinfect** | 1 % bleach solution (1 L bleach to 10 L water) or hydrogen peroxide. |\n| **Dispose of porous items** | Items that have been heavily infested (carpet, drywall) should be discarded. |\n| **Dry completely** | Use fans, dehumidifiers, or heat to ensure 0 % moisture. |\n| **Repaint/repair** | Once dry, repaint with mold‑resistant paint or replace damaged materials. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. When to Call a Professional\n\n- **Large infestations** (more than 10 sq ft).  \n- **Hidden mold** behind walls or under flooring.  \n- **Health concerns** (persistent symptoms, immunocompromised individuals).  \n- **Structural damage** or extensive water damage.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nMold is a fungus that thrives on moisture and organic material. It can cause health problems, damage property, and produce a musty odor. Keeping indoor humidity low, fixing leaks, and cleaning up water promptly are the best ways to prevent mold. If you suspect a significant mold problem, professional inspection and remediation are recommended.",

      "system_answer": "**Radium was discovered by the Curie pair—Marie Curie (née Sklodowska) and her husband Pierre Curie—in 1898.**\n\n- **Background**  \n  - The Curies were studying the newly discovered element polonium (named after Marie’s homeland, Poland) and the phenomenon of radioactivity that had been described by Henri Becquerel in 1896.  \n  - They isolated a highly radioactive substance from pitch‑blende (uranium ore) that was more active than any known element.\n\n- **Discovery**  \n  - In 1898, after months of painstaking purification, they identified this new element and named it **radium** (from the Latin *radius*, meaning “ray”) because of its intense radioactivity.  \n  - The discovery was announced in a paper titled *“On the Nature of the New Radioactive Substance”* and later published in the *Journal de Physique*.\n\n- **Recognition**  \n  - The Curies were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 (shared with Henri Becquerel) for their work on radioactivity, and Marie Curie received a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discovery of radium and polonium.\n\nSo, the discovery of radium is credited to **Marie Curie and Pierre Curie**.",

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It belongs to a family of disorders known as **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)**, which also include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer, and the human form, **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Happens in the Brain?\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Prions** | Misfolded proteins (PrP^Sc) that induce normal prion proteins (PrP^C) to adopt the same abnormal shape. |\n| **Spongiform change** | The brain develops tiny holes (“spongy” appearance) due to loss of neurons and myelin. |\n| **Symptoms** | In cattle: ataxia (loss of coordination), tremors, behavioral changes, and eventual death. In humans: rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, and death within months to years. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Does It Spread?\n\n| Route | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Feed‑borne** | The most common route in cattle: feeding animals with protein‑rich feed (e.g., rendered meat‑and‑bone meal) that contains infected tissue. |\n| **Vertical transmission** | Rarely, infected embryos or placenta can transmit the disease. |\n| **Human exposure** | Consumption of contaminated beef products (especially brain, spinal cord, or other nervous tissue) can transmit the prion to humans, leading to vCJD. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. History & Outbreaks\n\n| Year | Event | Impact |\n|------|-------|--------|\n| **1986** | First BSE case identified in the UK. | Triggered global concern. |\n| **1990s** | Major outbreaks in the UK, France, Ireland, and the US. | Over 1 million cattle culled; millions of tons of beef banned from export. |\n| **2000s–present** | BSE cases have dramatically declined due to strict controls. | Only sporadic cases in a few countries (e.g., Japan, New Zealand). |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prevention & Control Measures\n\n| Measure | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Feed bans** | Prohibit the use of ruminant protein in cattle feed. |\n| **Culling** | Remove and destroy infected animals and their carcasses. |\n| **Testing** | Post‑mortem brain testing for BSE in high‑risk animals (e.g., >30 months old). |\n| **Trace‑back** | Track the origin of beef products to ensure they come from BSE‑free herds. |\n| **Public education** | Inform consumers about safe beef handling and cooking. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Human Health\n\n- **Variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)** is the human manifestation of BSE prions.  \n- **Incidence**: < 200 cases worldwide since the 1990s.  \n- **Symptoms**: Rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, visual disturbances, and death within 1–2 years.  \n- **Risk**: Primarily from consuming infected beef products; no evidence of person‑to‑person transmission.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Current Status\n\n- **BSE in cattle**: Rare, largely controlled through feed bans and surveillance.  \n- **vCJD in humans**: Very low incidence; ongoing monitoring in countries with a history of BSE.  \n- **Research**: Scientists continue to study prion biology, potential diagnostics, and therapeutic strategies, though no cure exists.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nMad cow disease (BSE) is a prion‑based, fatal brain disorder in cattle that can be transmitted to humans as variant CJD through contaminated beef. It is largely controlled today by banning ruminant protein in cattle feed, rigorous testing, and culling of infected animals.",

      "system_answer": "**Natural gas is a fossil‑fuel gas mixture that is extracted from underground reservoirs.**  \nIts composition varies with the source, but the bulk of the gas is made up of simple hydrocarbons and a few non‑hydrocarbon gases.  A typical “wet” natural‑gas field might contain:\n\n| Component | Typical range (by volume) | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; the main energy source. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | Adds calorific value; used for petrochemical feedstock. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Often separated for LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). |\n| **Butanes (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 2 % | Also separated for LPG. |\n| **Other higher hydrocarbons** (pentanes, hexanes, etc.) | < 1 % | Usually removed in processing. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0.5 – 10 % | Non‑combustible; dilutes the gas. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.5 – 5 % | Non‑combustible; removed for pipeline quality. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.1 % (often < 0.01 %) | Toxic; must be scrubbed. |\n| **Water vapor (H₂O)** | < 0.5 % | Condensed out during processing. |\n| **Trace gases** (e.g., helium, argon, neon, methane‑derived gases) | < 0.1 % | Usually negligible. |\n\n### Key points\n\n1. **Methane** is the energy‑rich core of natural gas; it is what makes the gas flammable and useful as a fuel.  \n2. **Ethane, propane, and butanes** are valuable as petrochemical feedstocks and are often separated from the main stream to produce LPG (liquefied petroleum gas).  \n3. **Non‑hydrocarbon gases** (nitrogen, CO₂, H₂S, water vapor) are typically removed or reduced during processing to meet pipeline specifications and safety standards.  \n4. The exact mix depends on the geological formation, depth, and age of the reservoir. For example, “dry” gas fields have very little ethane and higher hydrocarbons, while “wet” fields contain more of them.\n\nIn short, natural gas is a mixture dominated by methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons and non‑hydrocarbon gases that are managed during processing to produce a clean, high‑energy fuel.",
