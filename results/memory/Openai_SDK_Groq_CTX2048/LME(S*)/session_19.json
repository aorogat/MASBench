      "system_answer": "Here’s a quick checklist to help you pick a guitar that feels right and sounds great:\n\n| What to Check | Why It Matters | How to Test It |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Body type & size** | Determines comfort and tone. | Sit in the same position you’ll play most often. Try a dreadnought, concert, or parlor for acoustic; a solid‑body or semi‑acoustic for electric. |\n| **Neck profile & scale length** | Affects playability and string tension. | Feel the neck in your hand; a slimmer neck is easier for smaller hands, a thicker neck gives more stability for power chords. |\n| **Fingerboard material** | Influences feel and sustain. | Maple, rosewood, and ebony are common. Try a few to see which feels smooth to your fingers. |\n| **Action (string height)** | Determines how hard you need to press strings. | Look at the string height at the 12th fret. Lower action is easier for beginners; higher action can give more sustain. |\n| **Tuning stability** | Keeps your guitar sounding good longer. | Tighten the strings and let them settle. If it stays in tune after a few minutes, it’s good. |\n| **Pickup type (if electric)** | Shapes the tone. | Try single‑coil (bright, crisp) vs humbucker (warm, thick). |\n| **Bridge & intonation** | Affects pitch accuracy across the fretboard. | Play a few notes on each string; if the 12th‑fret note is sharp or flat, the intonation needs adjustment. |\n| **Build quality** | Longevity and resonance. | Inspect the body for cracks, check that the neck is straight, and ensure all screws and hardware are solid. |\n| **Sound** | The most obvious test. | Play a few chords, scales, and songs you know. Does it feel and sound like what you want? |\n| **Budget & warranty** | Practical considerations. | Decide how much you’re willing to spend and look for a warranty that covers manufacturing defects. |\n\n**Extra Tips**\n\n1. **Try a few models** – Even if you’re leaning toward a specific brand, test at least two or three guitars in the same price range.  \n2. **Ask for a demo** – Many stores let you play a guitar for a short period. Use that time to test different tunings and playing styles.  \n3. **Bring a friend** – A second opinion can help you spot issues you might miss.  \n4. **Check the strings** – New guitars often come with cheap strings. If you’re buying a used guitar, consider swapping them out right away.  \n5. **Consider future upgrades** – If you plan to upgrade later, think about a guitar that can accommodate better pickups, a different neck, or a higher‑quality bridge.  \n\nHappy hunting! If you have any specific style or genre in mind, let me know and I can tailor the advice further.",

      "system_answer": "Here are some practical ways to stretch your phone’s battery life and keep it running longer between charges:\n\n| Tip | Why it helps | How to do it |\n|-----|--------------|--------------|\n| **Turn off unused features** | Each sensor (Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC) draws power even when you’re not using it. | Go to Settings → Connections → toggle off Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC when you don’t need them. |\n| **Use battery‑saving mode** | Most phones have a built‑in “Battery Saver” or “Low‑Power Mode” that limits background activity and reduces performance. | Enable it in Settings → Battery → Battery Saver (Android) or Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode (iOS). |\n| **Reduce screen brightness & timeout** | The display is the biggest power consumer. | Lower brightness to 30‑50 % or use adaptive brightness. Set the screen timeout to 30 seconds or 1 minute. |\n| **Limit background app refresh** | Apps constantly syncing data drain the battery. | Settings → Apps → [App] → Battery → Disable background activity or set “Unrestricted” to “Allowed” only for essential apps. |\n| **Turn off push notifications** | Each notification wakes the phone and uses data. | Settings → Notifications → Disable notifications for non‑essential apps. |\n| **Use Wi‑Fi instead of mobile data** | Wi‑Fi is usually more power‑efficient than cellular. | Connect to Wi‑Fi whenever possible; disable mobile data in Settings → Connections. |\n| **Disable auto‑updates** | Automatic updates can run in the background. | Settings → System → Software updates → Disable auto‑download or schedule updates for off‑peak hours. |\n| **Close unused apps** | Some apps stay in memory and keep background processes running. | Swipe up or double‑tap the home button (or use the app switcher) and swipe away apps you’re not using. |\n| **Keep the phone cool** | Heat accelerates battery drain and can shorten lifespan. | Avoid leaving the phone in direct sunlight or hot cars. Use a case that doesn’t trap heat. |\n| **Check battery health** | A degraded battery will drain faster. | On iOS: Settings → Battery → Battery Health. On Android: Settings → Battery → Battery Health (or use a third‑party app like AccuBattery). |\n| **Use a power‑efficient charger** | Fast chargers can heat the battery and reduce its lifespan. | Use the charger that came with your phone or a reputable brand; consider a 5‑15 W charger for everyday use. |\n| **Update your OS & apps** | Developers often release optimizations that reduce battery usage. | Keep your phone’s software up to date via Settings → System → Software update. |\n| **Turn on “Dark Mode”** | OLED/AMOLED screens use less power when displaying dark colors. | Settings → Display → Dark Mode (or Night Mode). |\n| **Use “Do Not Disturb” during sleep** | Prevents the phone from waking up for notifications. | Schedule Do Not Disturb in Settings → Notifications → Do Not Disturb. |\n\n### Quick “Battery‑Saver Checklist” (one‑tap)\n1. **Battery Saver** → On  \n2. **Brightness** → 30‑40 % (or adaptive)  \n3. **Screen timeout** → 30 s / 1 min  \n4. **Wi‑Fi** → On, Mobile data → Off (when possible)  \n5. **Background app refresh** → Off for non‑essential apps  \n6. **Notifications** → Off for non‑essential apps  \n7. **Auto‑updates** → Off / scheduled  \n\nIf you try these steps and still notice rapid battery drain, it might be time to check the battery health or consider a replacement.

      "system_answer": "### Slow‑Cooker Success Guide  \n*(All the tricks are easy to remember, so you can keep the “slow‑cooking” magic alive without extra hassle.)*\n\n| # | Tip | Why It Works | Quick How‑to |\n|---|-----|--------------|--------------|\n| **1** | **Start with a “Sear”** | Searing meat locks in flavor and gives a richer color. | 1–2 min per side in a hot pan with a splash of oil. |\n| **2** | **Layer Wisely** | Heavier veggies (potatoes, carrots) stay firm; delicate greens (spinach, kale) should go on top. | Bottom: meat & root veggies → middle: onions, garlic → top: leafy greens. |\n| **3** | **Use the Right Cut** | Tough cuts (chuck, round) become tender; lean cuts (sirloin, chicken breast) can dry out. | Stick to chuck roast, pork shoulder, or bone‑in chicken thighs. |\n| **4** | **Add Acid Late** | Acid (tomatoes, wine, vinegar) can toughen meat if added too early. | Add tomatoes or wine in the last 30–60 min of cooking. |\n| **5** | **Don’t Over‑Fill** | A full pot reduces heat circulation, leading to uneven cooking. | Keep the pot at least ¾ full; add more liquid if needed. |\n| **6** | **Use the Right Liquid** | Too little liquid can dry out; too much can dilute flavors. | 1–2 cups of broth, wine, or a mix of broth + water. |\n| **7** | **Season in Stages** | Salt draws moisture out; adding it too early can make the dish watery. | Salt the meat before searing, then add the rest of the seasonings after the slow‑cook starts. |\n| **8** | **Keep the Lid On** | The lid traps heat and moisture, ensuring even cooking. | Only lift the lid for a quick stir or to check doneness. |\n| **9** | **Use a Thermometer** | Guarantees doneness without guessing. | Beef: 195–205 °F (90–96 °C); Chicken: 165 °F (74 °C). |\n| **10** | **Finish with Fresh Herbs** | Adds brightness that slow cooking can mute. | Stir in chopped parsley, cilantro, or basil right before serving. |\n| **11** | **Thicken Smartly** | Thickening agents can settle at the bottom or become gummy. | 1–2 Tbsp cornstarch + 2 Tbsp cold water (slurry) added in the last 15 min; or a roux (butter + flour) stirred in at the end. |\n| **12** | **Plan for Leftovers** | Slow‑cooked meals often taste better the next day. | Store in airtight containers; reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave. |\n\n---\n\n#### Quick “Starter” Recipe (for reference)\n\n| Ingredient | Amount |\n|------------|--------|\n| 2 lb beef chuck, cut into 2‑inch cubes |  |\n| 2 Tbsp olive oil |  |\n| 1 large onion, sliced |  |\n| 3 carrots, cut into chunks |  |\n| 2 potatoes, cubed |  |\n| 3 cloves garlic, minced |  |\n| 1 cup beef broth |  |\n| ½ cup red wine (optional) |  |\n| 2 bay leaves |  |\n| 1 tsp dried thyme |  |\n| Salt & pepper | To taste |\n\n**Method**\n\n1. **Sear** the beef in the slow cooker (or a skillet) until browned on all sides.  \n2. Add onion, garlic, carrots, potatoes, and bay leaves.  \n3. Pour in broth and wine; season with thyme, salt, pepper.  \n4. Cook **Low** for 8 hrs or **High** for 4 hrs.  \n5. **Finish** with a cornstarch slurry if you want a thicker sauce.  \n6. Sprinkle fresh parsley before serving.\n\n---\n\n#### Common Pitfalls & Fixes\n\n| Problem | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| Meat too dry | Add a splash of broth or a bit of water; cook a bit longer. |\n| Vegetables mushy | Add them later (last 2 hrs) or use firmer varieties. |\n| Sauce too thin | Thicken with slurry or let it simmer uncovered for 15 min. |\n| Too salty | Dilute with more broth or add a potato to absorb excess salt. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nTreat the slow cooker like a “set‑and‑forget” oven: the key is preparation. By searing, layering, and seasoning thoughtfully, you’ll get consistently delicious results—no more “slow‑cooking disasters.” Happy cooking!",
