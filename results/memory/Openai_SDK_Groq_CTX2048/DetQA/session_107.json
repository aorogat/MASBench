Forensic evidence shows that each victim was chosen for their direct connection to the family’s past grievances, not for any aesthetic or inheritance purpose.  The other options—completing her aesthetics, inheriting the family legacy, or achieving family unification—do not align with the documented motives or the selection of victims.\",\" The planner’s diary entries mention a vow to “right the wrongs done to my family.”\",\" The pattern of victims shows a clear link to those who had harmed her relatives.\",\" Forensic evidence links the murders to the planner’s unique signature, confirming her direct involvement.\",\" The motive aligns with revenge rather than aesthetic or inheritance goals.\"}",
