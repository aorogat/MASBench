      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. The outsider killed at the gathering\",\"reasoning\":\"Rudy was found dead at the entrance with no signs of self‑harm or struggle, and there was no evidence linking Colonel Eastbrooke to the scene.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Phila may know part of the truth, and this part of the inheritance as a hush money\",\"reasoning\":\"The mistress’s motive is to keep Phila (Felicia) from exposing any hidden information that could jeopardize the inheritance plan.
