      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. The Brandt couple\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the Brandt couple is the only group directly connected to the deceased’s personal affairs—sharing a close relationship with the victim and having a clear motive for the death. The other characters (Mrs. Hemm, Mr. and Mrs. MacNamara, Miss House) are either peripheral or lack any documented link to the victim’s demise.

Detective Harcourt, who was conducting the investigation at the time, had both the opportunity and the professional obligation to secure any potential evidence.

A marriage certificate dated 2015, found in the study, lists her as Brand’s spouse after the death of his first wife, Valerie. Diary entries from Brand refer to ‘Mrs. Brand’ in the context of family and estate matters, which is consistent with a spouse’s role rather than a lawyer or an agency executor. No legal documents or correspondence identify her as a lawyer or as an agency executioner, further supporting the conclusion that she is Brand’s second wife.\",\"clue1\":\"Marriage certificate (2015) lists Mrs. Brand as Brand’s spouse.\",\"clue2\":\"Diary entries mention ‘Mrs. Brand’ in family‑related contexts.\",\"clue3\":\"No documents refer to Mrs. Brand as a lawyer or an agency executor.\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Inheriting through a valid will\",\"reasoning\":\"The Brandt couple’s claim to the estate is supported by a notarized will left by the deceased, which names them as primary beneficiaries. Probate court filings confirm the will’s authenticity and the absence of any fraudulent activity. There is no evidence of a transfer of ownership, a purchase transaction, or the use of falsified identity to secure the inheritance.

Miss Pema Khodro\",\"reasoning\":\"The investigation revealed that Miss Pema Khodro was the only individual who had both motive and opportunity to kill Quentin Ducassin. She was the last person seen with him before his death, and forensic analysis of the crime scene matched her DNA on the weapon used. Additionally, her financial records show a sudden influx of money shortly after the murder, suggesting a financial motive.
