The empire’s attempts to re‑assert control over its southern provinces were repeatedly thwarted by Norman military successes, culminating in the loss of Sicily in 1194.  The Normans were the empire’s most persistent and damaging adversary during the 11th‑12th centuries. |\n| **Armenia (Crusader‑era context)** | **The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia** | In the 12th‑13th centuries, the Crusader states (many of which were ruled by Norman‑descended leaders) came into conflict with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.

      "question": "What were the origins of the Raouliii family?",
      "system_answer": "**The Raouliii (or “Raoul”) family was a Norman‑French noble house that rose to prominence in the 11th–12th centuries and later became a notable line in the Crusader states.**  \n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Name & Etymology** | “Raoul” comes from the Germanic *Ragwald* (“counsel‑wolf”). The Latinized form “Rauli” (or “Raouliii” in medieval manuscripts) was used in the Crusader chronicles. |\n| **Geographic Origin** | The family’s roots lie in **Normandy** (the northern French region that had become a major source of Crusader knights).  The earliest members are recorded in the *County of Blois* and the *County of Anjou*, both of which were key recruiting grounds for Crusaders. |\n| **Early Members** | - **Raoul de la Roche** (c. 1070‑c. 1120), a nephew of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, who became Lord of Caesarea.  <br> - **William de la Roche**, Raoul’s brother, who served as a senior knight in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  <br> These men illustrate the family’s early migration from Normandy to the Levant. |\n| **Role in the Crusader States** | 1. **Military service** – The Raouliii were among the most trusted Norman contingents in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Principality of Antioch.  <br> 2. **Political influence** – Several members served as *constables*, *seneschals*, and *royal advisors* in the Crusader courts.  <br> 3. **Land holdings** – They were granted estates in the *Judea* and *Galilee* regions, often in exchange for military service. |\n| **Later Decline** | By the late 12th century the family’s male line dwindled.  A few cadet branches survived into the 13th century, but the main line became extinct after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187 and the subsequent loss of their estates. |\n| **Legacy** | The Raouliii are remembered mainly for their early Crusader service and for the way they exemplified the Norman migration from Normandy to the Levant.  Their name appears in several key chronicles (e.g., William of Tyre, the *Chronicle of the Crusades*), underscoring their importance in the early history of the Crusader states. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThe Raouliii were a Norman‑French noble family that originated in Normandy (and the surrounding counties of Blois/Anjou), migrated to the Crusader states in the early 12th century, and played a significant military and political role in the Kingdom of Jerusalem before the line faded in the late 12th/early 13th centuries.",

      "system_answer": "The **primary measure** that captures a problem’s inherent difficulty is its **time‑complexity** (often expressed asymptotically, e.g., O(n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ), etc.).  \n\n- **Why time‑complexity?**  \n  - It tells you how the running time of the best known algorithm grows with the size of the input.  \n  - It is the basis for the major complexity classes (P, NP, EXP, etc.) that classify problems by difficulty.  \n\n- **Other related measures**  \n  - **Space‑complexity** (memory usage) is also used, especially for space‑bounded classes like PSPACE.  \n  - **Circuit complexity** or **parallel complexity** (e.g., NC, AC⁰) are more specialized, but still fall under the umbrella of computational complexity.\n\nSo, in short: **time‑complexity (asymptotic running time)** is the key metric that broadly defines how hard a computational problem is to solve.",
