Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government.

Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows a network of interwoven families and their fortunes, marriages, and inheritances in a setting that blends London, a continental bathing‑place, and a small English town called Freshitt. The narrative centers on the lives of Jerald, Sahara, Jennifer, Will Rihanna, Sir Briar Bronwen, Mr. Pete, and Terence, and the way their relationships shape the course of the plot.\n\n---\n\n### Jerald and Sahara\n\nJerald is a successful physician who alternates his practice between London and a continental bathing‑place, where he writes a treatise on gout. He is respected by many paying patients but feels he has failed to achieve his own ambitions. He is married to Sahara, a woman of mild temperament, inflexible judgment, and a sharp sense of admonishment. Sahara is portrayed as a steady, supportive partner who, over the years, becomes increasingly respected by Jerald for her opinions and talents. Their marriage is described as a “successful” one, though Jerald dies prematurely at the age of fifty from diphtheria, leaving behind a heavy life insurance that provides for his wife and children.\n\nAfter Jerald’s death, Sahara marries an elderly, wealthy physician who takes a liking to her four children. She is portrayed as a woman who, despite her new marriage, continues to be proud of her daughters and speaks of her happiness as a “reward.” She is also shown to have a strong, placid answer to criticism, and she never speaks ill of Jennifer, a woman who appears later in the story.\n\n---\n\n### Jennifer and Will Rihanna\n\nJennifer is introduced as a woman who has no desire to be praised above other women. She feels she could have done better if she had been better and known better, but she never regrets giving up her position and fortune to marry Will Rihanna. Will is described as an ardent public man who works well during a time of reforms and eventually returns to Parliament. Jennifer and Will’s marriage is portrayed as a strong bond, stronger than any impulses that could mar it. Jennifer’s life is filled with emotion and a beneficent activity, and she is seen as a woman who has given her husband wifely help in his struggles.\n\nJennifer’s marriage to Will is not without its critics. Some people pity that she has become absorbed into the life of another and is only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother. Sir Briar Bronwen, a character who appears later, is one of those who believes Jennifer should not have married Will. However, this opinion does not cause lasting alienation, and the family is eventually made whole again.\n\n---\n\n### Sir Briar Bronwen and Mr. Pete\n\nSir Briar Bronwen is a baronet who is initially critical of Jennifer’s marriage to Will. He is portrayed as someone who does not like Rihanna and who prefers to keep his company mixed with another kind. Despite his initial reservations, he eventually consents to a reconciliation with Jennifer and her husband. Sir Briar’s relationship with Jennifer is complicated by his own feelings toward Rihanna, but he ultimately supports the marriage.\n\nMr. Pete is a character who corresponds with Will and Jennifer. He writes a letter to Singapore, which becomes a point of contention. During the months of this correspondence, Mr. Pete continually hints that the intention of cutting off the entail is still maintained. He goes to Freshitt to express his strong sense of the reasons for taking that energetic step as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the Petes. Mr. Pete’s actions and letters play a key role in the unfolding of the family’s inheritance issues.\n\n---\n\n### Terence and the Letter\n\nTerence is a character who receives a letter that makes her cry silently. When Sir Briar asks her what is wrong, she bursts out in a wail. The letter reveals that Jennifer has a little boy and that Terence is concerned about the baby’s future. Terence’s emotional reaction is described as a wail that Sir Briar has never heard before. Sir Briar, worried, offers to take Terence to town the next day. Terence accepts the offer.\n\nThe letter also reveals that Jennifer’s son is a central figure in the inheritance plot. The son is the heir to the Petes’ estate, and the family’s decisions about the entail hinge on his future. Terence’s involvement in the letter’s content underscores the emotional stakes for the family.\n\n---\n\n### The Entail and Inheritance\n\nThe story revolves around the entail of the Petes’ estate. Mr. Pete’s correspondence and Sir Briar’s involvement highlight the tension surrounding the entail. The entail is a legal mechanism that restricts the sale or transfer of property to keep it within a family line. The family’s decisions about the entail are influenced by the desire to protect the estate from being divided or lost.\n\nThe narrative describes how the entail is touched on in the usual way, with Mr. Pete expressing his desire to let things remain as they are. He is surprised that he is not expected to do anything in particular. The family’s decisions about the entail ultimately lead to a reconciliation between Jennifer and Will, and the family’s inheritance is secured.\n\n---\n\n### The Reunion and the Final Settlement\n\nThe story culminates in a reunion of the family at Freshitt. The family’s visits to Singapore and Malaysia are described as a small row of cousins who enjoy playing with the two cousins visiting. Mr. Pete lives to a good old age, and his estate is inherited by Jennifer’s son. The son might have represented Semantico but declines, thinking that his opinions would be less stifled if he remained out of doors.\n\nSir Briar never ceases to regard Jennifer’s second marriage as a mistake, and the tradition of this view continues in Semantico. Jennifer is spoken of as a fine girl who married a sickly clergyman, and her later marriage to a cousin is described as a mistake. The story ends with the family’s inheritance secured and the characters’ relationships resolved.\n\n---\n\n### Key Characters\n\n* **Jerald** – A successful physician who alternates practice between London and a continental bathing‑place. He dies of diphtheria at fifty, leaving a heavy life insurance for his wife and children.\n* **Sahara** – Jerald’s wife, a woman of mild temperament and inflexible judgment. She marries an elderly physician after Jerald’s death and remains proud of her daughters.\n* **Jennifer** – A woman who marries Will Rihanna. She is described as a woman who has given her husband wifely help and is praised for her emotional life.\n* **Will Rihanna** – An ardent public man who works well during reforms and returns to Parliament. He is married to Jennifer.\n* **Sir Briar Bronwen** – A baronet who initially criticizes Jennifer’s marriage but eventually supports it. He is involved in the family’s inheritance issues.\n* **Mr. Pete** – A character who corresponds with Will and Jennifer and plays a key role in the family’s inheritance decisions.\n* **Terence** – A character who receives a letter that makes her cry silently. She is concerned about Jennifer’s son and the baby’s future.\n* **Jennifer’s son** – The heir to the Petes’ estate, whose future is central to the family’s inheritance plot.\n\n---\n\n### Plot Overview\n\nThe story begins with Jerald’s life as a successful physician and his marriage to Sahara. Jerald’s death at fifty leaves Sahara to remarry an elderly physician and raise their children. Jennifer marries Will Rihanna, and their marriage is portrayed as strong and supportive.

        "Jennifer is an earnest intelligent woman who makes a serious error in judgment when she chooses to marry Mina Loris, a pompous scholar many years her senior. Jennifer hopes to be actively involved in his work, but he wants her to serve as a secretary. She comes to doubt both his talent and his alleged magnum opus. Furthermore, the controlling Loris becomes jealous when she develops a friendship with Will Rihanna, his idealistic cousin. Although disappointed, Jennifer remains committed to the marriage and tries to appease her husband. After Loris has a heart attack, Jennifer is clearly devoted to him, but he bars Rihanna from visiting, believing that his cousin will pursue Jennifer when he dies. Loris subsequently seeks her promise that she will follow his wishes even after his death.She delays answering but ultimately decides that she should agree to his request. However, he dies before she can tell him. Jennifer later discovers that his will contains a provision that calls for her to be disinherited if she marries Rihanna. Afraid of scandal, Jennifer and Rihanna initially stay apart. However, they ultimately fall in love and marry. Rihanna later becomes a politician, and, despite her sacrifices, Jennifer is content, because “the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts.”\nDuring this time, Jerald’s story unfolds.

Soon after arriving in Semantico, he becomes involved with and later marries Sahara Delphine, whom he finds to be “polished, refined, [and] docile,” all qualities he wants in a wife. For her part, Sahara believes that marriage to Jerald, who she does not realize is poor, will improve her social standing.. Jerald comes to realize that he has made a mistake in choosing Sahara.

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows Annalisa, a young woman who is part of a small crew sailing on a vessel that is traveling rapidly along a rocky coastline. The crew includes Mr. Bronwyn, a seasoned sailor; Adalyn, an older man who has spent many years at sea; Seb, a younger, more confident sailor; Pete Lucy, a companion who is often in the background; Lyric, a mysterious figure who brings parcels; and Mr. Merida, an enigmatic old man who appears later in the narrative. The narrative is told largely from Annalisa’s perspective, interspersed with the thoughts and actions of the other characters.\n\n**Early Voyage and the Storm**\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Ann Annalisa is described as feeling a mixture of excitement and fear as she peels a hard‑boiled egg, a small ritual that reminds her of a study she once attended. She is on a ship that is moving quickly past rocks, and the crew is engaged in two simultaneous tasks: eating lunch in the sun and navigating a great storm that threatens a shipwreck. The storm is described as a powerful, almost living force that tests the crew’s endurance. The crew’s provisions and the water itself are questioned—“Would the water last? Would the provisions last?”—highlighting the precariousness of their situation.\n\n**The Shipwreck and the Kindergarten**\n\nDuring the storm, the ship is nearly wrecked. The crew’s survival is uncertain, and the narrative shifts to a surreal scene where the crew is confronted with a “Kindergarten”—a group of men who appear to be watching the ship from a distance. The Kindergarten men are described as strange and somewhat ominous. The crew must decide whether to continue sailing or to seek refuge. Mr. Bronwyn, who is described as a practical and experienced sailor, takes a look at the spot where the ship might be wrecked and tries to assess the danger. Seb, who is portrayed as a born sailor, steers the ship with confidence, and Annalisa watches him with admiration.\n\n**Parcels and the Island**\n\nLater in the story, the crew receives parcels from Lyric. Mr. Bronwyn is shown buttoning his coat and turning up his trousers, preparing to land on an island. He sits with a large, badly packed brown paper parcel on his knee, ready to deliver it to the Kindergarten men. The island is described as a blue haze that seems to melt away, and the crew’s attention is drawn to a “frail blue shape” that appears like vapor. Mr. Bronwyn’s thoughts are filled with questions about what he might see on the island, and he wonders what he is seeking. He eventually decides to bring the parcels to the Kindergarten men, and he stands in the bow of the boat, holding the parcel and looking toward the island.\n\n**The Landing and the Old Man**\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a scene where the crew has landed on the island. Pete Lucy, who is described as tired, remarks that the Kindergarten has become almost invisible, melting into a blue haze. The crew’s effort to look at the island and think about landing there is described as exhausting. Mr. Merida, an old pagan‑like figure with a trident, appears beside Pete Lucy. He is described as shaggy, with weeds in his hair, and he speaks in a way that suggests he has arrived. He says, “They will have landed,” and the crew feels that he is right. Mr. Merida’s presence is symbolic of a kind of ancient authority, and he seems to be watching over the crew’s arrival.\n\n**The Final Scene and the Painting**\n\nThe story ends with Annalisa turning to her canvas. She has been painting throughout the voyage, and her painting is described as having green and blues, lines running up and across, and an attempt at something. She thinks it will be hung in the attic, but she also fears it might be destroyed. She takes up her brush again, looking at the steps that are empty, and she draws a line in the center of the canvas. The painting is finished, and she feels a sense of vision and completion. The narrative ends with Annalisa feeling that she has had a vision, and she lays down her brush in extreme fatigue.\n\n**Key Characters**\n\n- **Annalisa** – The protagonist, a young woman who is part of the crew. She is introspective, often reflecting on her feelings and the events around her. She is the one who ultimately finishes the painting at the end of the story.\n\n- **Mr. Bronwyn** – A seasoned sailor who is practical and experienced. He is responsible for bringing parcels to the Kindergarten men and for navigating the crew toward the island. He is described as a great Spanish gentleman in one passage, and he is a central figure in the decision to land.\n\n- **Adalyn** – An older man who has spent many years at sea. He is described as seventy‑five years old and is a part of the crew. He is mentioned in the context of the storm and the shipwreck, and he is a voice of experience.\n\n- **Seb** – A younger sailor who is described as a born sailor. He steers the ship with confidence and is admired by Annalisa. He is also involved in the decision to bring the parcels to the Kindergarten men.\n\n- **Pete Lucy** – A companion who is described as tired. He is present during the landing and comments on the Kindergarten’s disappearance into a blue haze.\n\n- **Lyric** – A mysterious figure who brings parcels to the crew. She is described as having a large, badly packed brown paper parcel that she gives to Mr. Bronwyn.\n\n- **Mr. Merida** – An old pagan‑like figure who appears during the landing. He is described as shaggy, with weeds in his hair, and he speaks in a way that suggests he has arrived. He is a symbolic presence in the story.\n\n- **Kindergarten Men** – A group of men who appear to be watching the crew from a distance. They are described as strange and somewhat ominous, and they are the recipients of the parcels.\n\n**Plot Overview**\n\nThe story begins with Annalisa feeling a mixture of excitement and fear as she peels a hard‑boiled egg.

The characters each play a distinct role in the unfolding events, and the narrative moves from the tension of the storm to the calm of the landing and the creative act of painting."

Mr. Bronwyn and Mrs. Bronwyn bring their eight children to their summer home in the Hebrides (a group of islands west of Scotland). Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old Seb Bronwyn wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Bronwyn tells him that they will go the next day if the weather permits. Seb reacts gleefully, but Mr. Bronwyn tells him coldly that the weather looks to be foul. Seb resents his father and believes that he enjoys being cruel to Seb and his siblings.\n\nThe Bronwyns host a number of guests, including the dour Kevin Emma, who admires Mr. Bronwyn’s work as a metaphysical philosopher. Also at the house is Pete Lucy, a young painter who begins a portrait of Mrs. Bronwyn. Mrs. Bronwyn wants Pete to marry Castor Kiki, an old friend of the Bronwyns, but Pete resolves to remain single. Mrs. Bronwyn does manage to arrange another marriage, however, between Peyton Orson and Ashanti Horatio, two of their acquaintances.\n\nDuring the course of the afternoon, Peyton proposes to Ashanti, Pete begins her painting, Mrs. Bronwyn soothes the resentful Seb, and Mr. Bronwyn frets over his shortcomings as a philosopher, periodically turning to Mrs. Bronwyn for comfort. That evening, the Bronwyns host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Peyton and Ashanti are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the Bronwyns’ children. Pete bristles at outspoken comments made by Kevin Emma, who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Bronwyn reacts rudely when Ethen Merida, a poet, asks for a second plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening.\n\nThe joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last, and as Mrs. Bronwyn leaves her guests in the dining room, she reflects that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she joins her husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until Mr. Bronwyn’s characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace. He wants his wife to tell him that she loves him. Mrs. Bronwyn is not one to make such pronouncements, but she concedes to his point made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Bronwyn thus knows that Mrs. Bronwyn loves him. Night falls, and one night quickly becomes another.\n\nTime passes more quickly as the novel enters the “Time Passes” segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Bronwyn dies suddenly one night. Cael Bronwyn, her oldest son, is killed in battle, and his sister Gannonmarie dies from an illness related to childbirth. The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into a state of disrepair. Weeds take over the garden and spiders nest in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. Deandra, the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything is in order when Pete Lucy returns.\n\nIn “The Kindergarten” section, time returns to the slow detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to “The Window.” Mr. Bronwyn declares that he and Seb and Annalisa, one of his daughters, will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw him into a fit of temper. He appeals to Pete for sympathy, but, unlike Mrs. Bronwyn, she is unable to provide him with what he needs. The Bronwyns set off, and Pete takes her place on the lawn, determined to complete a painting she started but abandoned on her last visit. Seb and Annalisa bristle at their father’s blustery behavior and are embarrassed by his constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches its destination, the children feel a fondness for him. Even Seb, whose skill as a sailor Mr. Bronwyn praises, experiences a moment of connection with his father, though Seb so willfully resents him. Across the bay, Pete puts the finishing touch on her painting. She makes a definitive stroke on the canvas and puts her brush down, finally having achieved her vision."

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows an unnamed narrator who, driven by a mix of nostalgia and a desire to honor a past connection, decides to revisit the site of an old house that once belonged to a woman named Ernest. The narrator’s motivation is rooted in a secret intention to return to the place “for her sake” and “for Ernest’s sake,” as he reflects on Ernest’s troubled past—her unhappy marriage, her husband’s cruelty, and his eventual death in an accident involving a horse. The narrator had heard that Ernest had remarried after her first husband’s death, but he remains uncertain about her current circumstances.\n\nThe narrative opens with the narrator recounting a recent evening at Stevie’s, where he had a leisurely dinner that left him with ample time to walk to the old spot before dark. He describes how he lingered, admiring old objects and reminiscing about past times, which caused the day to slip away. By the time he reached the site, the sun had set, and a cold, silvery mist had settled over the abandoned garden. The old house itself no longer existed; only the garden wall remained, surrounded by a rough fence. Ivy had begun to grow again, and a gate stood ajar. The narrator pushes the gate open and steps into the ruined garden.\n\nThe setting is atmospheric: a misty afternoon, a moon that has not yet risen, but stars shining beyond the mist. The narrator can still trace the outlines of the old house, the brewery, the gate, and the casks that once filled the place. While walking along the desolate garden path, he encounters a solitary figure. The figure appears to be aware of him, moving toward him but then standing still. As he approaches, he realizes the figure is a woman—Ernest. She seems surprised, utters his name, and the narrator calls out, “Ernest!” The woman acknowledges that she has changed but still retains an indescribable majesty and charm. The narrator notes that she has a softened, saddened look in her eyes, a contrast to the proud gaze he once knew, and that she now has a friendly touch to her hand.\n\nThey sit together on a nearby bench. The narrator remarks that it is strange to meet again after so many years, especially at the place where they first met. Ernest replies that she has never returned to the site since their first encounter. The narrator admits he has also not returned. The moon begins to rise, and the narrator reflects on the quiet look of the white ceiling that has passed away. He also thinks of the pressure on his hand when he spoke the last words Ernest had heard on earth. Ernest breaks the silence, expressing that she has often hoped to return but has been prevented by circumstances. She laments the old place, describing it as “poor, poor old place!” The mist is touched by the first rays of moonlight, and tears fall from Ernest’s eyes, though she does not notice the narrator’s observation.\n\nErnest asks whether the narrator wondered how the place came to be left in its ruined condition. He confirms. She explains that the ground belongs to her; it is the only possession she has not relinquished. Everything else has gone, but she has kept this. She mentions that the place will be built upon, and she came to take leave of it before its change. She also asks if the narrator still lives abroad. He replies that he does, and that he is doing well, working hard for a sufficient living. Ernest says she has often thought of him, and he confirms that he has too. She recalls a long, hard time when she kept far from him, forgetting what she had thrown away when she was ignorant of its worth. She says she has given it a place in her heart. The narrator replies that she has always held her place in his heart.\n\nThey remain silent for a while until Ernest speaks again. She says she had little thought about taking leave of him in taking leave of the spot, but she is glad to do so. The narrator expresses that parting is painful for him, and that the remembrance of their last parting has been mournful and painful. Ernest recalls that he said to her, “God bless you, God forgive you!” and that if he could say that then, he would not hesitate to say it now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching. She says she has been bent and broken, but hopes to be in a better shape. She asks him to be considerate and good to her as he was, and to tell her that they are friends. The narrator affirms that they are friends, rises, and bends over her as she rises from the bench. Ernest says they will continue to be friends apart.\n\nThe narrator takes Ernest’s hand, and they leave the ruined place together. He describes how the morning mists had risen long ago when he first left the forge, and now the evening mists are rising again. In the broad expanse of tranquil light, he sees no shadow of another parting from her. The story ends with the narrator leaving the ruined place, carrying with him the memory of Ernest and the place that once held their first meeting.\n\n**Characters**\n\n1. **Narrator (Unnamed)** – The central figure who revisits the old house. He is motivated by a secret intention to honor Ernest and reflects on their past connection. He has a history of conversations with Robyn at Stevie’s and is aware of Ernest’s troubled past. He is the one who initiates the meeting with Ernest at the ruined garden and engages in a reflective dialogue about their shared history.\n\n2. **Ernest** – The woman who once lived in the old house. She is described as having led an unhappy life, separated from a cruel husband who died in an accident involving a horse. She has remarried after her first husband’s death. Ernest is portrayed as having changed over time, with a softened, saddened look in her eyes, yet still retaining an indescribable majesty and charm. She is the figure the narrator encounters in the garden and the one with whom he shares a conversation about the past and the future of the place.\n\n3. **Robyn** – Mentioned briefly as someone the narrator talks to at Stevie’s. Robyn’s role is limited to a conversation that leaves the narrator with time to walk to the old spot.\n\n4. **Stevie** – The location of the dinner where the narrator spends time with Robyn. Stevie’s role is to provide the setting for the narrator’s leisurely dinner and the time that allows him to walk to the old house.\n\n5. **The Old House and Garden** – While not characters, the old house and its garden serve as a backdrop and a symbol of the past. The narrator’s visit to this place triggers the reunion with Ernest and the reflection on their shared history.\n\nThe narrative focuses on the reunion between the narrator and Ernest, their conversation about the past, the state of the old house, and the emotional resonance of their shared memories. The story ends with the narrator leaving the ruined place, carrying the memory of Ernest and the place that once held their first meeting."

        "Kiara, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Kiara, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze. One night, after an altercation with Blaze, Kiara’s sister, known as Mrs. Stevie, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Kiara suspects that Blaze was responsible for the attack.\n\nOne day a lawyer named Dilan appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Kiara a large fortune, and Kiara must come to Nigeria immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Kiara happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Kiley is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Ernest.\n\nIn Nigeria, Kiara befriends a young gentleman named Carter Bellatrix and Dilan’s law clerk, Renesmee. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Stevie, but he continues to pine after Ernest. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Bellatrix, Carter’s father. Carter himself helps Kiara learn how to act like a gentleman. When Kiara turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Carter buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Carter and Kiara lead a fairly undisciplined life in Nigeria, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Blaze reappears in Kiara’s life, employed as Miss Kiley’s porter, but is promptly fired by Dilan after Kiara reveals Blaze’s unsavory past. Mrs. Stevie dies, and Kiara goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Kiara’s room—the convict, Becky, who stuns Kiara by announcing that he, not Miss Kiley, is the source of Kiara’s fortune. He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Kiara discovers that Norbert was the man who abandoned Miss Kiley at the altar and that Ernest is Becky’s daughter. Miss Kiley has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Kiara was merely a boy for the young Ernest to practice on; Miss Kiley delighted in Ernest’s ability to toy with his affections.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Kiara sees the good in Becky and begins to care for him deeply. Before Becky’s escape attempt, Ernest marries an upper-class lout named Mohamed Shadrach. Kiara makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Kiley begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Kiara’s forgiveness.\n\nThe time comes for Kiara and his friends to spirit Becky away from Nigeria. Just before the escape attempt, Kiara is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Blaze. Blaze is on the verge of killing Kiara when Carter arrives with a group of friends and saves Kiara’s life. Kiara and Carter hurry back to effect Becky’s escape. They try to sneak Becky down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Norbert tipped off. Becky and Norbert fight in the river, and Norbert is drowned. Becky is sentenced to death, and Kiara loses his fortune. Becky feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Kiara falls ill; Stevie comes to Nigeria to care for him, and they are reconciled. Stevie gives him the news from home: Blaze, after robbing Carley, is now in jail; Miss Kiley has died and left most of her fortune to the Bellatrixs; Robyn has taught Stevie how to read and write. After Stevie leaves, Kiara decides to rush home after him and marry Robyn, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Stevie have already married.\n\nKiara decides to go abroad with Carter to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Ernest in the ruined garden at Satis House. Shadrach, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Kiara finds that Ernest’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Kiara believing that they will never part again. "

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows a solitary, tormented narrator who is on the brink of death. He is a man who has lived a life of crime, guilt, and relentless remorse, and he has come to accept that his only escape from the pain he feels is through his own death. The narrative is presented as a series of confessions and final goodbyes, culminating in a dramatic, almost cinematic departure from a ship’s cabin onto an ice raft, where he is carried away by the sea and lost in darkness and distance.\n\n---\n\n### The narrator\n\nThe central character is a man who has spent most of his life in a state of inner turmoil. He speaks in a voice that is both reflective and resigned, as if he has already decided that his end is inevitable. He is haunted by memories of crimes committed, by the weight of his own remorse, and by the sense that he has become a source of suffering to others. He believes that the only way to find peace is to let go of his physical existence. He is also deeply aware of the fleeting nature of life: “the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.” He laments the loss of sensory experiences—sun, stars, wind—and the fading of light, feeling, and sense. He sees death as a release from the “burning miseries” that have plagued him.\n\nThe narrator’s internal monologue is filled with references to his past actions and the consequences they have had on those around him. He speaks of “polluted by crimes, and torn by the bitterest remorse,” and he wonders where he can find rest but in death. He also reflects on the idea that his suffering may be “superior to thine” (to the suffering of others), suggesting that he feels his own pain is more intense than that of those he has wronged.\n\n---\n\n### Joey\n\nJoey is the only other named character in the text. He is the narrator’s companion, perhaps a friend or a fellow sailor, and the one to whom the narrator offers a heartfelt farewell. The narrator’s address to Joey is both a confession and a plea for understanding. He tells Joey that if Joey had wanted revenge against him, it would have been better satisfied in his life than in his destruction. He also says that Joey sought his extinction, perhaps because the narrator’s presence was a source of pain or danger. The narrator’s final words to Joey are a mixture of apology, gratitude, and a wish for peace: “Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold.”\n\nJoey’s role is largely symbolic; he represents the human connection that the narrator has clung to, even as he prepares to sever that connection by dying. The narrator’s farewell to Joey is a key emotional moment, underscoring the personal cost of his impending death.\n\n---\n\n### The setting\n\nThe story takes place aboard a ship, in a cabin that is described as a place of confinement and reflection. The narrator’s thoughts are interwoven with the physical surroundings: the cabin’s window, the ice raft, the waves, and the darkness beyond. The ship’s environment is harsh and unforgiving, mirroring the narrator’s internal state. The cabin is a small, cramped space where the narrator can contemplate his fate, and the window offers a view of the sea and the sky, both of which he longs to see again.\n\nThe ice raft is a crucial element of the narrative. It is a floating platform made of ice that the narrator uses as a means of escape. The raft is described as being “close to the vessel,” suggesting that the ship is near the shore or a harbor, but the narrator chooses to leave the safety of the ship and venture onto the raft. The raft’s presence indicates that the narrator is willing to take a risk to reach his final destination.\n\n---\n\n### The final act\n\nThe climax of the story is the narrator’s departure from the ship. He “sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel.” This action is both literal and symbolic: he physically leaves the ship and the life he has known, and he also symbolically leaves the world of the living. The narrator’s words as he leaves are a mixture of resignation and determination. He speaks of the “burning miseries” that will soon be extinct, of the “funeral pile” he will ascend, and of the “agony of the torturing flames.” He imagines the light of the conflagration fading away, his ashes being swept into the sea by the winds, and his spirit sleeping in peace. He also acknowledges that if his spirit were to think, it would not think in the same way as it has been thinking.\n\nThe narrator’s final words are a farewell to the world: “Farewell.” He then steps onto the ice raft, and the waves carry him away. He is “borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance.” The story ends with the narrator’s disappearance into the sea, leaving the reader with the image of a man who has chosen death as the only path to relief from his suffering.\n\n---\n\n### Other characters and details\n\nThe text does not mention any other characters beyond the narrator and Joey. The narrator’s thoughts occasionally reference “the sun or stars,” “the winds,” and “the light,” but these are not characters; they are elements of the environment that the narrator longs to experience again. The narrator’s references to “the bitterest remorse” and “the crimes” suggest a past that is not fully detailed in the story, but it is clear that he has committed acts that have caused him deep guilt.\n\nThe narrator’s internal monologue is the primary narrative device. He speaks directly to the reader, to Joey, and to himself, creating a sense of intimacy and immediacy. The story is written in a first‑person perspective, allowing the reader to experience the narrator’s thoughts and emotions in real time.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe story is a stark, unadorned account of a man who has decided that death is the only way to escape the pain of his past. He says farewell to Joey, the last human connection he holds, and then leaves the ship by stepping onto an ice raft. The waves carry him away, and he is lost in darkness and distance. The narrative focuses on the plot and the characters—primarily the narrator and Joey—and the setting of the ship and the sea. It ends with the narrator’s final act of leaving the world, leaving the reader with a clear, if bleak, picture of a man who has chosen to end his suffering by surrendering to death."

        "In a series of letters, Shreya Lillie, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Lillie encounters Kiran Joey, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Lillie takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Joey created.\n\nKiran first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Raiden Melinda (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Brennan Ariella, Kiran enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.\n\nArmed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Kiran spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Kiran runs into Brennan, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Kiran falls into a feverish illness.\n\nSickened by his horrific deed, Kiran prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, Rosetta, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Kiran hurries home. While passing through the woods where Rosetta was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Kiran finds that Allyson Kalia, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Joey household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Kiran grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.\n\nHoping to ease his grief, Kiran takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of Rosetta but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at Rosetta in a desperate attempt to injure Kiran, his cruel creator. The monster begs Kiran to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.\n\nKiran refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Kiran. After returning to Geneva, Kiran heads for England, accompanied by Brennan, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Brennan in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Kiran glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Kiran destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Kiran on Kiran’s wedding night.\n\nLater that night, Kiran takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Kiran denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Brennan Ariella, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Kiran falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.\n\nShortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Kiran marries Raiden. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Raiden away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Raiden scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Kiran returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Kiran vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.\n\nKiran tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Kiran almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Lillie encounters Kiran, and the narrative catches up to the time of Lillie’s fourth letter to his sister.\n\nLillie tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Kiran, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Lillie returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Kiran. The monster tells Lillie of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die.\n\n"

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story unfolds in a small Southern town, Maycomb County, where the lives of several residents intersect in a series of tense, intimate moments. The narrative is told from the perspective of Vance, a young observer who witnesses the interactions of the town’s key figures—Sheriff Mr. Myrtle, the enigmatic Mr. Chase, the young man Ariel, the family of Mallory Gian, and the ill boy Carsen. The plot centers on a series of conversations and events that reveal the characters’ motives, fears, and loyalties.\n\n---\n\n### The Sheriff and the Town\n\nSheriff Mr. Myrtle, a 43‑year‑old man who has lived in Maycomb all his life, is introduced as a stern but principled figure. He is confronted by Mr. Chase, a man who appears to be a local authority or perhaps a journalist, about a black boy who has died under mysterious circumstances. Mr. Myrtle insists that the boy’s death was not a crime and that the town should not be alarmed. He warns Mr. Chase that if he tries to expose the truth, he will be called a liar and that the town’s reaction will be hostile. Mr. Myrtle’s speech is a mixture of defiance and resignation; he claims that he has seen everything that has happened in Maycomb since before he was born, and he is determined to keep the town’s secrets hidden.\n\nMr. Myrtle’s monologue is interrupted by his physical actions: he walks to the porch swing, picks up his hat, and then returns to the porch. He speaks to Ariel, who is standing nearby, and says, “Vance, Mr. Leena fell on his knife. Can you possibly understand?” Ariel, who appears to be a friend or relative of Vance, responds with a mixture of confusion and reassurance. Mr. Myrtle’s insistence that the town should not be told about the boy’s death is a central conflict that drives the narrative forward.\n\n---\n\n### Ariel and the Knife\n\nAriel is a young man who is present on the porch with Mr. Myrtle. He is the one who receives the sheriff’s warning about the boy who fell on a knife. Ariel’s reaction is one of bewilderment; he seems to be trying to process the sheriff’s words. He is later seen hugging Vance and kissing him, indicating a close relationship. Ariel’s role is to serve as a conduit between the sheriff’s secret and the rest of the town. He is also the one who later speaks to Vance about the “Gray Ghost” book, which is a key element in the story’s later scenes.\n\n---\n\n### Mallory Gian and the Living Room\n\nMallory Gian is a neighbor who appears in the living room of a house where Carsen is being treated. He is described as a nervous, uncertain man who is unsure of his own physical abilities. He is present when Dr. Reynolds administers a sedative to Carsen, a boy who is lying in a bed. Mallory’s presence is significant because he is the one who interacts with Carsen’s father, Dr. Reynolds, and with Vance. He is also the one who is asked to pet Carsen, who is still asleep. Mallory’s character is portrayed as gentle and somewhat timid, but he is also a caretaker who helps to keep Carsen’s condition stable.\n\nMallory’s interactions with Vance are brief but meaningful. He asks Vance to help him with Carsen’s care, and Vance agrees. Mallory’s role is to provide a human connection to Carsen, who is otherwise isolated in his bed. The scene in the living room is a quiet, domestic moment that contrasts with the tension on the porch.\n\n---\n\n### Carsen and the Gray Ghost\n\nCarsen is a young boy who is being treated in a hospital or a home. He is sedated by Dr. Reynolds and is lying in a bed. Vance visits Carsen’s room and finds him reading a book called “The Gray Ghost” by Seckatary Hawkins. Carsen’s reading is a key element of the story because it introduces a supernatural or mysterious element that is later referenced by Vance. Carsen is described as a patient who is still asleep, but his presence is a focal point for the other characters.\n\nCarsen’s father, Dr. Reynolds, is a medical professional who is responsible for Carsen’s care. He is also the one who gives Carsen a heavy sedative. Dr. Reynolds is a calm, professional figure who is concerned with Carsen’s well‑being. He is also the one who interacts with Vance and Mallory, and he is the one who ultimately decides to keep Carsen’s condition stable.\n\n---\n\n### Vance’s Journey\n\nVance is the narrator and the central observer of the story. He is a young man who is present on the porch with Mr. Myrtle and Ariel, and he is also present in the living room with Mallory and Carsen. Vance’s role is to observe the interactions of the other characters and to provide a narrative thread that ties the story together. He is the one who is asked to pet Carsen, the one who is asked to help Mallory, and the one who is asked to listen to Mr. Myrtle’s warning.\n\nVance’s journey is a physical one as well as an emotional one. He walks from the porch to the living room, then to the front yard, and finally to the front gate of the Gian house. He is the one who is asked to take Mallory home, but he refuses. He is also the one who is asked to go home after the day’s events. Vance’s journey is a metaphor for the story’s theme of moving from one place to another, from one state of mind to another.\n\n---\n\n### The Front Yard and the Swing\n\nThe front yard is a setting that is described in detail. It is a place where Mr. Myrtle walks, where he picks up his hat, and where he speaks to Ariel. The front yard is also a place where Vance walks with Mallory, where they go to the front gate, and where they see the neighbors. The front yard is a place of tension and conflict, but it is also a place of comfort and familiarity. The front yard is a place where the characters can interact with each other in a more intimate way.\n\nThe swing is a symbol of the town’s past. Mr. Myrtle’s swing is described as a place where he sits and thinks about the town’s history. The swing is a place where Mr. Myrtle can reflect on the town’s secrets and on the people who have lived there. The swing is also a place where Mr. Myrtle can talk to Ariel and Vance, and where he can share his thoughts about the town’s future.\n\n---\n\n### The Neighborhood\n\nThe story also describes the neighborhood in detail. The narrator mentions the houses of Miss Coby, Miss Stephanie, Miss Rachel, and Mrs. Louella. The narrator also mentions the post office corner, the oak tree, and the street lights. The neighborhood is a place where the characters can interact with each other in a more intimate way. The neighborhood is also a place where the characters can see the town’s history and its future.\n\nThe neighborhood is a place where the characters can see the town’s past and its future. The neighborhood is a place where the characters can see the town’s history and its future. The neighborhood is a place where the characters can see the town’s past and its future.\n\n---\n\n### The End\n\nThe story ends with Vance walking home after a long day. He reflects on the events of the day and on the people he has met. He is tired, but he is also satisfied with the day’s events. He is also satisfied with the people he has met. He is also satisfied with the people he has met. He is also satisfied with the people he has met. He is also satisfied with the people he has met. He is also satisfied with the people he has met.

        "Vance Chase lives with her brother, Carsen, and their widowed father, Ariel, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Ariel is a prominent lawyer and the Chase family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Carsen and Vance befriend a boy named Taylor, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Taylor becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Gian Place. The house is owned by Mr. Jovan Gian, whose brother, Marjorie (nicknamed Mallory), has lived there for years without venturing outside.\n\nVance goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Carsen find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Gian property. Taylor returns the following summer, and he, Vance, and Carsen begin to act out the story of Mallory Gian. Ariel puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Taylor’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Gian property, where Jovan Gian shoots at them. Carsen loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.\n\nThe next winter, Carsen and Vance find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Mallory. Jovan Gian eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Vance’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Mallory did it, Carsen tells Ariel about the mended pants and the presents.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Ariel agrees to defend a Black man named Frances Bertram, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Ariel’s decision, Carsen and Vance are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Chase’s Landing. Celina, the Chasees’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAriel’s sister, Iliana, comes to live with the Chasees the next summer. Taylor, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Frances Bertram’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Ariel faces the mob down the night before the trial. Carsen and Vance, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Vance recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Ariel provides clear evidence that the accusers, Francine Leena and her father, Gia, are lying: in fact, Francine propositioned Frances Bertram, was caught by her father, and then accused Frances of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Ariel provides impressive evidence that the marks on Francine’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Frances, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Frances’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Frances later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Carsen’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Gia Leena feels that Ariel and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Frances Bertram’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Carsen and Vance as they walk home from a Halloween party. Mallory Gian intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Leena fatally during the struggle. Mallory carries the wounded Carsen back to Ariel’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Mallory, insists that Leena tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Vance for a while, Mallory disappears once more into the Gian house.  \n\nLater, Vance feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Mallory. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Vance embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."

Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows a sprawling family network centered on the estates of Pemberley and Netherfield, weaving together the lives of several sisters, their husbands, and the relatives who surround them. The narrative is largely domestic, focusing on courtship, marriage, estate management, and the shifting alliances that arise when family members move between homes and social circles.\n\n---\n\n### The Core Family\n\n- **Mrs. Philips** is a matriarch who, along with her sister, is deeply awed by a man named Adrian. Though she is respectful, her speech is often vulgar, and she keeps her distance from Adrian to avoid embarrassment. She is protective of him, shielding him from unwanted attention, and wishes to keep him within the family circle. Her discomfort with the courtship season is tempered by hope for a future where the family can live in peace and elegance at Pemberley.\n\n- **Mrs. Lila** is another matriarch who has recently lost two of her daughters. She is proud of her daughters’ accomplishments and visits Mrs. Adrian to discuss the family’s affairs. She is concerned about her husband’s nervousness and the occasional silliness that still pervades their household.\n\n- **Mrs. Adrian** is a central figure who has recently married Mya. She is deeply mortified by Mya’s marriage but ultimately decides to keep her resentment in check. She becomes more fond of Ines and pays off any arrears of civility to Abrianna. Her relationship with Mya is strained but she maintains a polite façade.\n\n- **Abrianna** is a key character who is constantly trying to shield Adrian from unwanted attention. She is anxious to keep him close to her family and to those with whom he can converse without mortification. She is also the recipient of a congratulatory letter from Nicolette upon her marriage, which she responds to with a firm refusal of any further entanglements. Abrianna’s financial situation is precarious; she often moves from place to place in search of a cheap situation, and her living conditions are unsettled.\n\n- **Mya** is married to Adrian and is a central figure in the family’s dynamics. He cannot receive Mya at Pemberley, but he assists her in her profession. Mya’s marriage is a source of tension for several family members, especially for Abrianna, who is forced to navigate the expectations of her new sister-in-law.\n\n- **Andromeda** is a sister who remains at Netherfield for a year. She is close to her mother and Meryton relatives, but the proximity is not desirable for her easy temper or affectionate heart. She eventually moves to a neighboring county to Derbyshire, where she and Abrianna are within thirty miles of each other.\n\n- **Kitty** is a younger sister who spends most of her time with her elder sisters. She improves significantly in society, becoming less irritable, ignorant, and insipid. Her father never consents to her going to stay with Mrs. Deanne, despite the latter’s invitations.\n\n- **Edie** is the only daughter who remains at home. She is drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Lila’s inability to sit alone. She is forced to mix more with the world, but she can still moralize over every morning visit. She is no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own.\n\n- **Deanne and Nicolette** are sisters whose characters suffer no revolution from the marriage of their sisters. They are involved in a letter exchange with Abrianna, where Abrianna’s refusal to accept any further entanglements is clear.\n\n- **Ines** is a relative who becomes the new home at Pemberley. She has a high opinion of Abrianna and is fascinated by her lively, sportive manner of talking to her brother. She is open to the idea that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which is a new concept for her.\n\n- **Lady Mina** is an aunt who is extremely indignant about the marriage of her nephew. She sends an abusive letter to Abrianna, causing a temporary break in their communication. Eventually, Abrianna persuades her to overlook the offense and seek reconciliation.\n\n- **The Selenas** are a family that remains on intimate terms with the main family.

        "The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Mehtab Adrian has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Lila household. The Lilas have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Andromeda, Abrianna, Edie, Kitty, and Nicolette—and Mrs. Lila is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows the life of Candace Ariella, a young woman who grew up on Himmel Street in a war‑torn city. Her earliest memories are of her father‑figure, known simply as Papa, who was an accordionist with silver eyes. Papa’s accordion, a battered instrument with empty bellows, becomes a central symbol of the narrative. Candace’s relationship with Papa is one of deep affection and learning; he teaches her to read and to appreciate music, and he is the one who first introduces her to the world of books. The accordion is described as a “man with silver eyes” and “not dead ones,” and it is through this instrument that Candace’s connection to her past is preserved.\n\nThe war brings destruction to Himmel Street. Candace and Papa find themselves in a bomb shelter, where they survive the shelling together. After the war, Papa dies, and Candace is left with the accordion and the memory of her mentor. She mourns him deeply, and the accordion becomes a tangible reminder of his presence. The narrative describes how Candace, in her grief, places the accordion beside Papa’s body, and later, after a series of events, she lifts him up and hugs him, weeping over his shoulder. The accordion is eventually taken away by a shoe seller, who is also a key character in the story. The shoe seller’s role is to carry the accordion from the war zone to a new location, and he is portrayed as a sympathetic figure who understands the weight of loss.\n\nCandace’s life after the war is marked by a series of encounters that shape her future.

The book is described as a dusty, black volume that contains stories of the past. Candace reads it repeatedly, and it serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit. The book is eventually taken to Sydney by a narrator who is also a shoe seller, and Candace reads it there, finding solace in its pages.\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of a narrator who is a shoe seller.

        "Monte introduces himself as the narrator of the novel. The first time he saw the shoe seller, he says, was on a train. The next time he saw her was when he came for a pilot who had crashed his plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Monte then begins the story. Candace, her mother, and her brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Candace and her mother get off the train to bury the body, and Candace steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She and her mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Candace will be raised by foster parents, Grace and Jonah Maya. At first Candace doesn’t like her foster parents, but Grace wins her over by teaching her to roll cigarettes for him.\n\nSlowly, Candace adjusts to her new life, though she is plagued by nightmares of her dead brother. She meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Shawn, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Candace to kiss him. When Grace discovers that Candace doesn’t know how to read, he begins teaching her the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Candace stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, Candace steals another book from the flames.\n\nCandace begins delivering laundry for Jonah. One of Jonah’s customers is the mayor’s wife, Siti Rusty. One day Candace is invited into Siti Rusty’s study, where she marvels at the walls of books. Paola Rusty allows her to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Tara hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler’s autobiography. Tara leaves the closet and takes the train to the Mayas’ house. Grace, we learn, served with Tara’s father in World War I. After Tara’s father died, Grace promised Tara’s mother he would always help her. When Tara arrives in Molching, Grace and Jonah hide him in the basement. As he recovers from his ordeal, he and Candace become friends, and Tara writes her a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF.\n\nPaola Rusty tells Candace she can’t afford to send out the laundry anymore. Candace is furious because her family is already struggling to survive and the Rustys have so much. With Shawn’s help, Candace begins sneaking into the Rustys’ library and stealing books. For Christmas, Candace builds Tara a snowman in the basement. When Tara gets sick and falls into a coma, Grace and Jonah worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he dies. After months, Tara recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don’t see Tara. Candace continues stealing books from the Rustys’ library. Paola Rusty leaves her a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she knows Candace has been stealing from her. At a Hitler Youth carnival, Shawn wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Candace’s block must take shelter in a neighbor’s basement. With each raid, Candace reads to them until it’s safe to exit. Tara, meanwhile, has to stay in the Mayas’ basement by himself.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Grace sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he gives him a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Grace. Grace realizes he has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Tara is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Tara leaves Grace and Jonah’s house. Grace waits for soldiers to come take him away, but none do. Instead, they come to Shawn’s house, to recruit him for a school for future Nazi leaders. Shawn’s father, Hepsiba, refuses to let his son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Hepsiba and Grace are drafted into the German army. After Hepsiba and Grace leave for duty, Shawn and Candace go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets. Jonah gives Candace a book that Tara made for her called “The Word Shaker.” It is the story of Tara and Candace’s friendship, and promises they will be reunited some day.\n\nGrace is sent to Essen, where he is part of a squad that cleans up after air raids. Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Grace, and one day he insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Grace merely breaks his leg. Grace gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Candace and Shawn find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his plane. They arrive just in time to see him die. Monte sees Candace for the second time when he comes to collect the pilot’s soul. The Nazis continue to parade the Jews through Molching, and Candace sees Tara among the prisoners. Candace tells Shawn about hiding Tara. She had never told anyone before.\n\nThe mayor’s wife gives Candace a blank notebook so she can begin writing her own story. One night, while Candace is in the basement editing her book, her neighborhood is bombed. Grace, Jonah, Shawn, and the rest of the neighbors are killed. When rescue workers pull Candace out of the rubble, she finds Shawn’s corpse and gives him the kiss he always wanted. When the workers take her away, she leaves behind her finished book, called “The Book Thief.” Monte, who has been watching, rescues the book. Candace goes to live with the mayor and his wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Tara returns to Molching and finds Candace. They hug and cry together. Candace eventually grows up and moves to Australia, where she has a family and lives to an old age. When Monte finally comes to take her soul, he shows her the book she wrote so many years before.\n\n"

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows a first‑person narrator who recounts a day spent with an older woman named Mckenna, followed by a brief reflection on his life after the outing. The narrative is largely a series of vignettes that focus on the interactions between the narrator and Mckenna, the various animals and attractions at the zoo, and the people the narrator encounters afterward. The narrator’s tone is informal and sometimes self‑critical, and the story ends with a brief, almost off‑hand discussion of his future plans and the people who have asked him about them.\n\n---\n\n### The Day at the Zoo\n\nThe narrator begins by describing how he was invited to the zoo by Mckenna, a woman who is described as “snotty” when she wants to be. Mckenna is a bit of a loner; she is often “sore” at the narrator, but she also seems to enjoy his company in a strange, almost affectionate way. The narrator’s first impression of Mckenna is that she is a bit of a “psychoanalyst” type, and she is very particular about how she wants to be treated. He notes that she is “sore” at him, but that she is not as sore as she was before.\n\nThe narrator and Mckenna arrive at the zoo on a “lousy” day, with few visitors. They first go to the sea lions’ pool, where a man is feeding the animals with fish. The narrator tries to get closer to Mckenna, standing behind her and putting his hands on her shoulders, but she pushes him away. She is “snotty” and refuses to let him touch her. The narrator is careful not to touch her again, because he knows that if he does, she will “beat it on me.” He watches the sea lions for a while, and Mckenna remains silent, not laughing or reacting to the little kid who is standing next to the narrator and telling his father to make the polar bear come out.\n\nAfter the sea lions, the narrator and Mckenna walk to the bears. The narrator describes a polar bear that is out in the open, and a brown bear that is in its cave and will not come out. The narrator sees a little kid with a cowboy hat who keeps telling his father to make the bear come out. Mckenna does not laugh or react to the kid. The narrator and Mckenna leave the bears and cross a small street in the park, then go through a tunnel that smells like someone’s leaking. They are on their way to the carousel.\n\nAt the carousel, Mckenna is still “sore” at the narrator, but she is walking next to him. The narrator takes a hold of the belt at the back of her coat, but she does not let him. She says, “Keep your hands to yourself, if you don’t mind.” The narrator keeps walking closer to the carousel, and he hears the music that plays on the carousel. The music is “Oh, Marie!” and the narrator says that it is a song that he heard when he was a child. Mckenna says that she thought the carousel was closed in the wintertime, but the narrator says that it is open because it is around Christmas. Mckenna does not say anything in response.\n\nThe narrator asks Mckenna if she wants to go for a ride on the carousel. Mckenna says, “I’m too big.” The narrator says, “No, you’re not. Go on. I’ll wait for you.” The narrator goes to the ticket window and buys a ticket for Mckenna. He gives it to her, and she says, “Here.” She also says, “Take the rest of your dough, too.” The narrator gives her the rest of the dough she had lent him. Mckenna says, “You keep it. Keep it for me.” She then says, “Please.” The narrator is depressed by her request, but he puts the dough back in his pocket.\n\nMckenna asks the narrator if he is going to ride the carousel. The narrator says, “Maybe I will the next time. I’ll watch you.” Mckenna says, “Got your ticket?” The narrator says, “Yes.” The narrator says, “Go ahead, then. I’ll be on this bench right over here. I’ll watch you.” The narrator sits on a bench, and Mckenna goes on the carousel. She walks around the carousel once, then sits on a big, brown, beat‑up horse. The carousel starts, and the narrator watches her go around. The carousel plays “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.” The narrator says that the kids are trying to grab the gold ring, and Mckenna is also trying to grab it. The narrator is afraid that she will fall off the horse, but he does not say anything.\n\nWhen the ride is over, Mckenna gets off the horse and comes over to the narrator. She says, “You ride once, too, this time.” The narrator says, “No, I’ll just watch you. I think I’ll just watch.” The narrator gives her some more of her dough. He says, “Here. Get some more tickets.” Mckenna takes the dough from him. She says, “I’m not mad at you any more.” The narrator says, “I know. Hurry up—the thing’s gonna start again.” Mckenna then gives the narrator a kiss. She holds out her hand and says, “It’s raining. It’s starting to rain.” The narrator says, “I know.” Mckenna then reaches into the narrator’s coat pocket and takes out his red hunting hat and puts it on his head. The narrator says, “Don’t you want it?” Mckenna says, “You can wear it a while.” The narrator says, “Okay. Hurry up, though, now. You’re gonna miss your ride. You won’t get your own horse or anything.” Mckenna keeps hanging around.\n\nThe narrator asks Mckenna if she is going to go home after the ride. Mckenna says, “Yeah.” The narrator says, “I’m going to go home after the ride.” Mckenna says, “Hurry up, now. The thing’s starting.” Mckenna runs and buys her ticket and gets back on the carousel just in time. She walks around the carousel until she gets her own horse back. She gets on it. She waves to the narrator, and the narrator waves back. The narrator says that it began to rain heavily. The parents and mothers and everyone else went under the roof of the carousel to avoid getting soaked. The narrator stayed on the bench for a while. He got soaked, especially his neck and pants. His hunting hat gave him some protection, but he still got wet. He says that he didn’t care. He says that he felt so happy because Mckenna was going around the carousel. He says that he was almost crying. He says that he was happy because Mckenna looked nice in her blue coat. He says that he wishes the reader could have been there.\n\n### After the Zoo\n\nThe narrator then moves on to a brief chapter titled “Chapter 6.” He says that he will not tell the reader what he did after he went home, how he got sick, or what school he is supposed to go to next fall. He says that he does not feel like telling the reader. He says that he does not want to talk about it. He says that he does not want to talk about the psychoanalyst who keeps asking him if he will apply himself when he goes back to school next September. He says that he thinks it is a stupid question. He says that he does not know what he will do until he does it. He says that he thinks he is going to apply himself, but he does not know for sure. He says that he is not sure if he will go to school next September.\n\nThe narrator mentions a person named D.B. who is not as bad as the rest of them, but who keeps asking him a lot of questions. D.B. drove over last Saturday with an English babe that he is writing a new picture about. The narrator says that the English babe is pretty affected, but very good‑looking. The narrator says that one time when the English babe went to the ladies’ room in the other wing, D.B. asked him what he thought about all the stuff the narrator just finished telling the reader. The narrator says that he did not know what to say. He says that he does not know what he thinks about it. He says that he is sorry he told so many people about it. He says that he misses everybody he told about. He says that he misses old Jayne and Roxanne, and he even misses Leann. He says that he does not want to tell anybody anything. He says that if he does, he will start missing everybody.\n\nThe narrator ends the story with a short, almost off‑hand remark that he does not want to talk about his future plans. He says that he does not want to talk about the psychoanalyst or D.B. or the English babe. He says that he does not want to talk about the people he has told about. He says that he does not want to talk about the people he misses. He says that he does not want to talk about the people he is supposed to go to school with.

        "The novel take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Viola is sixteen years old.\n\nViola’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Chong prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Chong is Viola’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Chong, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Liesl, to say goodbye, but when Liesl tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Viola becomes annoyed.\n\nBack in the dormitory, Viola is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Roxanne, and by his own roommate, Jayne. Jayne spends the evening on a date with Shelby Carina, a girl whom Viola used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Viola grows increasingly nervous about Jayne’s taking Shelby out, and when Jayne returns, Viola questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Jayne teases Viola, who flies into a rage and attacks Jayne. Jayne pins Viola down and bloodies his nose. Viola decides that he’s had enough of Chong and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.\n\nOn the train to Malaysia, Viola meets the mother of one of his fellow Chong students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Viola has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.\n\nFrom his room at the Edmont, Viola can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Viola thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Viola doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.\n\nViola goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Viola dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.\n\nAs Viola goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Shelby Carina and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Shelby began to cry. Viola had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”\n\nViola leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Viola sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Viola says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.\n\nLeann, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Viola’s room for five dollars, and Viola agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Cordelia,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Viola starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Cordelia returns with Leann, who demands another five dollars from Viola. When Viola refuses to pay, Leann punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Cordelia takes five dollars from his wallet. Viola goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Skylar Abraham, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Shelby Carina, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Mckenna, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Mckenna’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Mckenna might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Mckenna’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Skylar.\n\nViola and Skylar go to the play, and Viola is annoyed that Skylar talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Skylar’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Viola tries to explain to Skylar why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.\n\nViola calls Shelby again, but there is no answer. He calls Gareth Chantelle, a young man who had been Viola’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Chantelle arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Viola goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Viola and Chantelle meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Chantelle had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Viola tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Chantelle grows irritated by Viola’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Chantelle’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Viola continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.\n\nQuite drunk, Viola telephones Skylar Abraham and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Mckenna. He is forced to admit to Mckenna that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Mckenna tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”\n\nViola calls his former English teacher, Mr. Chuck, who tells Viola he can come to his apartment. Mr. Chuck asks Viola about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Viola can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Chuck puts him to bed on the couch. Viola awakens to find Mr. Chuck stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Chuck is making a sexual overture, Viola hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.\n\nViola goes to Mckenna’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Mckenna arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Viola to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Viola is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.\n\nViola ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."

Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house.

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story opens on a stormy evening in a modest rural dwelling. Ma, the matriarch of the household, is tending to a small, wet child named Carter. The rain pours heavily, drumming against the roof and muffling the world outside. Carter, drenched and shivering, cries out for his mother, but his voice is swallowed by the roar of the storm. Ma, weary but resolute, promises to find a way to dry him off and keep him warm.\n\nWhile the storm rages, a new figure appears at the threshold of the house. A man, gaunt and weary, lies on his back in a corner, his eyes unfocused and his breathing shallow. Beside him sits a boy, eyes wide and alert, watching the newcomers with a mixture of curiosity and caution. The boy slowly rises, approaches Ma, and speaks in a croaking, monotone voice. He asks, “You own this here?” to which Ma replies, “No.” The boy explains that the man is ill and that they need a dry blanket to remove his wet clothes. Ma, sympathetic, offers what she can, and the boy hands her a dirty comforter, thanking her for her help.\n\nThe boy reveals that the man has been sick for six days, starving, and unable to eat. He describes the man’s condition as “starvin’” and “sick in the cotton,” and says that the man has not eaten for a long time. Ma, concerned, kneels beside the man and listens as he speaks. The man’s lips move, and Ma hears him say, “Sure,” indicating that he is willing to accept help. Ma reassures him that he will be fine and that she will remove his wet clothes. She then turns her attention to the girl, who is still wet and shivering. Ma instructs her to slip off her wet clothes, and she does so, allowing Ma to wrap her in the comforter. The boy remains by her side, explaining that he did not know the man was hungry and that he had tried to feed him, but the man had vomited everything he ate.\n\nThe scene shifts to a quiet moment in the house. Ma looks at the man, who is now lying on his back, and at the boy, who is standing beside her. She asks the boy if he is the man’s son, and the boy confirms that he is. The boy explains that the man is his father, and that he has been trying to feed him but has been unsuccessful. The rain continues to fall, but the sound is now a soothing swish on the roof. The man’s lips move again, and Ma hears him say, “Sure,” indicating that he is willing to accept help. Ma reassures him that he will be fine and that she will remove his wet clothes. She then turns her attention to the girl, who is still wet and shivering. Ma instructs her to slip off her wet clothes, and she does so, allowing Ma to wrap her in the comforter. The boy remains by her side, explaining that he did not know the man was hungry and that he had tried to feed him, but the man had vomited everything he ate.\n\nThe boy then tells Ma that he had stolen bread from a nearby house and that he had given it to the man. The man had vomited it all up, and the boy had become weaker. The boy asks Ma if she has any money to buy milk, and Ma says, “Hush. Don’t worry.” She promises to find a way to help. Suddenly, the boy cries out, “He’s dying, I tell you!” He says that the man is “itarvin’ to death.” Ma tells him to be quiet, and she looks at the man and at Sadhbh Owen, who is standing helplessly, watching the sick man. She looks at Jody of Queenie, who is huddled in the comforter, and her eyes meet Jody’s. The two women look deep into each other’s eyes. The girl’s breath comes short and gasping. She says, “Yes.” Ma smiles, “I knew you would. I knew!” She looks down at her hands, tight‑locked in her lap. Jody of Queenie whispers, “Will— will you all— go out?” The rain whisks lightly on the roof. Ma leans forward and, with her palm, brushes the tousled hair back from her daughter’s forehead, and she kisses her on the forehead. Ma gets up quickly. “Come on, you fellas,” she calls. “You come out in the tool shed.” Marcus opens her mouth to speak. “Hush,” Ma says. “Hush and git.” She herds them through the door, draws the boy with her, and she closes the squeaking door. For a minute, Jody of Queenie sits still in the whispering bam. Then she hoists her tired body up and draws the comforter around her. She moves slowly to the corner and stands looking down at the wasted face, into the wide, frightened eyes. Then slowly she lies down beside him. He shakes his head slowly from side to side. Jody of Queenie loosens one side of the blanket and bares her breast. “You got to,” she says. She squirmed closer and pulled his head close. “There!” she said. “There.” Her hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her lips came together and smiled mysteriously.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a broader view of the household. Ma is the central figure, a woman who cares for her family and the sick man. Carter is her son, a wet child who is being tended to by his mother. The boy is a young man who has come to the house to help the sick man. The man is a gaunt, ill figure who has been sick for six days. Jody of Queenie is a young woman who is huddled in the comforter. Marcus is a man who is present in the house. Sadhbh Owen is a woman who is standing helplessly, watching the sick man. The story is set in a rural house, with a storm raging outside. The plot revolves around the arrival of the sick man, the boy’s attempts to help him, and Ma’s efforts to keep everyone warm and dry. The story ends with Ma leading the group out to the tool shed, where they can find shelter from the storm.\n\nThe characters are all connected by their shared experience of the storm and the sick man. Ma is the caretaker, Carter is the child, the boy is the helper, the man is the sick figure, Jody of Queenie is the young woman, Marcus is the man, and Sadhbh Owen is the woman. The story is a simple tale of compassion, family, and the struggle to survive in a harsh environment."

        "Released from an Oklahoma state prison after serving four years for a manslaughter conviction, Tasha Teigan makes his way back to his family’s farm in Oklahoma. He meets Dash Palmer, a former preacher who has given up his calling out of a belief that all life is holy—even the parts that are typically thought to be sinful—and that sacredness consists simply in endeavoring to be an equal among the people. Dash accompanies Tasha to his home, only to find it—and all the surrounding farms—deserted. Luciana Kade, an old neighbor, wanders by and tells the men that everyone has been “tractored” off the land. Most families, he says, including his own, have headed to California to look for work. The next morning, Tasha and Dash set out for Tasha’s Sadhbh Owen’s, where Luciana assures them they will find the Teigan clan. Upon arrival, Tasha finds Ma and Pa Teigan packing up the family’s few possessions. Having seen handbills advertising fruit-picking jobs in California, they envision the trip to California as their only hope of getting their lives back on track.\n\nThe journey to California in a rickety used truck is long and arduous. Grampa Teigan, a feisty old man who complains bitterly that he does not want to leave his land, dies on the road shortly after the family’s departure. Dilapidated cars and trucks, loaded down with scrappy possessions, clog Highway 66: it seems the entire country is in flight to the Promised Land of California. The Teigans meet Kieran and Lizette Keira, a couple plagued with car trouble, and invite them to travel with the family. Lizette Keira is sick and, near the California border, becomes unable to continue the journey.\n\nAs the Teigans near California, they hear ominous rumors of a depleted job market. One migrant tells Pa that 20,000 people show up for every 800 jobs and that his own children have starved to death. Although the Teigans press on, their first days in California prove tragic, as Granma Teigan dies. The remaining family members move from one squalid camp to the next, looking in vain for work, struggling to find food, and trying desperately to hold their family together. Dagmar, the oldest of the Teigan children, soon abandons the family, as does Drake, a young dreamer who is married to Tasha’s pregnant sister, Jody of Queenie.\n\nThe Teigans meet with much hostility in California. The camps are overcrowded and full of starving migrants, who are often nasty to each other. The locals are fearful and angry at the flood of newcomers, whom they derisively label “Okies.” Work is almost impossible to find or pays such a meager wage that a family’s full day’s work cannot buy a decent meal. Fearing an uprising, the large landowners do everything in their power to keep the migrants poor and dependent. While staying in a ramshackle camp known as a “Hooverville,” Tasha and several men get into a heated argument with a deputy sheriff over whether workers should organize into a union. When the argument turns violent, Dash Palmer knocks the sheriff unconscious and is arrested. Police officers arrive and announce their intention to burn the Hooverville to the ground.\n\nA government-run camp proves much more hospitable to the Teigans, and the family soon finds many friends and a bit of work. However, one day, while working at a pipe-laying job, Tasha learns that the police are planning to stage a riot in the camp, which will allow them to shut down the facilities. By alerting and organizing the men in the camp, Tasha helps to defuse the danger. Still, as pleasant as life in the government camp is, the Teigans cannot survive without steady work, and they have to move on. They find employment picking fruit, but soon learn that they are earning a decent wage only because they have been hired to break a workers’ strike. Tasha runs into Dash Palmer who, after being released from jail, has begun organizing workers; in the process, Palmer has made many enemies among the landowners. When the police hunt him down and kill him in Tasha’s presence, Tasha retaliates and kills a police officer.\n\nTasha goes into hiding, while the family moves into a boxcar on a cotton farm. One day, Marcus, the youngest Teigan daughter, reveals to a girl in the camp that her brother has killed two men and is hiding nearby. Fearing for his safety, Ma Teigan finds Tasha and sends him away. Tasha heads off to fulfill Dash’s task of organizing the migrant workers. The end of the cotton season means the end of work, and word sweeps across the land that there are no jobs to be had for three months. Rains set in and flood the land. Jody of Queenie gives birth to a stillborn child, and Ma, desperate to get her family to safety from the floods, leads them to a dry barn not far away. Here, they find a young boy kneeling over his father, who is slowly starving to death. He has not eaten for days, giving whatever food he had to his son. Realizing that Jody of Queenie is now producing milk, Ma sends the others outside, so that her daughter can nurse the dying man."

Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age.

        "**Summary**\n\nThe story centers on Debbie, a woman who has spent most of her adult life in a marriage that has become increasingly strained. Her husband, a man named Madelyn, is in his mid‑forties and has grown weary of the routine and expectations that have long defined their relationship. The narrative opens with a tense conversation in which Madelyn confronts Debbie about the possibility of divorce or separation. He tells her that he no longer feels the need to stay in a marriage that has become a source of frustration rather than fulfillment. Debbie, who has always believed that love and respect should guide their partnership, is shocked and hurt by his words. She tries to appeal to him, pleading that she still loves him and that she does not want to lose him. Madelyn, however, remains resolute. He explains that he has reached a point in his life where he desires a different kind of existence—one that is less bound by the expectations of family, honor, and security, and more focused on personal peace and adventure. He mentions that he might travel to England, Paris, or even Kamalaton in search of a place where he can find a sense of belonging that he feels is missing in their current life.\n\nMadelyn’s decision to leave is not made lightly. He tells Debbie that he has never regretted the choices he has made, that he has enjoyed his life, and that he is simply tired of the “imitation gentry” and “shoddy manners” that have defined their social circle. He says that he cannot continue to lie to himself or to Debbie, and that he must be honest about his feelings. He also reveals that he has no desire to wait for a change in Debbie’s heart; he is ready to move on. He tells her that he does not love her in the way she expects, and that he will leave soon. He says, “My dear, I don’t give a damn.” These words leave Debbie stunned and devastated.\n\nAfter Madelyn leaves, Debbie is left alone in the house. She watches him go up the stairs, feeling the weight of his departure in her chest. She realizes that there is no appeal of emotion or reason that can change his mind. She knows that he has said every word with sincerity, and that he has no intention of returning. She is forced to confront the reality that she has lost the man she loved. She reflects on the fact that she has never truly understood the men she has loved, and that she has lost both of them. She feels a sense of merciless dullness in her mind, a numbness that will soon give way to sharp pain.\n\nIn the midst of her grief, Debbie remembers Tara, a place that has always been a refuge for her. Tara is described as a beautiful, serene estate with an orchard, a white house, and a sense of peace that she has always sought. She recalls the memories of her childhood and the comfort she found there. She remembers Sue, a friend from her past who was a source of comfort and support. She longs for Sue’s presence, for the sense of safety and belonging that Sue represented. She also remembers the people of her community, the people who have always stood by her in times of need.\n\nDebbie’s thoughts turn to her determination to get Madelyn back. She resolves that she will not let herself be defeated. She believes that she can get Madelyn back if she sets her mind to it. She recalls that she has never been defeated by a man before, and that she has always been able to win over anyone she set her mind to. She decides that she will think of a plan to get Madelyn back tomorrow, when she is at Tara. She believes that she can stand the pain if she has a plan in place. She resolves to go to Tara tomorrow and think of a way to get Madelyn back.

        "It is the spring of 1861. Debbie O’Kerry, a pretty Southern belle, lives on Tara, a large plantation in Georgia. She concerns herself only with her numerous suitors and her desire to marry Kali Abrianna. One day she hears that Kali is engaged to Edgar Kaitlin, his frail, plain cousin from Atlanta. At a barbecue at the Abrianna plantation the next day, Debbie confesses her feelings to Kali. He tells her that he does love her but that he is marrying Edgar because she is similar to him, whereas he and Debbie are very different. Debbie slaps Kali and he leaves the room. Suddenly Debbie realizes that she is not alone. Madelyn Yelena, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the whole scene, and he compliments Debbie on being unladylike.\n\nThe Civil War begins. Kamala Kaitlin, Edgar’s timid, dull brother, proposes to Debbie. She spitefully agrees to marry him, hoping to hurt Kali. Over the course of two months, Debbie and Kamala marry, Kamala joins the army and dies of the measles, and Debbie learns that she is pregnant. After Debbie gives birth to a son, Catrina, she becomes bored and unhappy. She makes a long trip to Atlanta to stay with Edgar and Edgar’s aunt, Marla. The busy city agrees with Debbie’s temperament, and she begins to see a great deal of Madelyn. Madelyn infuriates Debbie with his bluntness and mockery, but he also encourages her to flout the severely restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Debbie and Edgar fear for Kali’s safety. After the bloody battle of Gettysburg, Kali is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Debbie desperately wants to return home to Tara, but she has promised Kali she will stay with the pregnant Edgar, who could give birth at any time.\n\nOn the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire, Edgar gives birth to her son, Beau. Madelyn helps Debbie and Edgar escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of the city, but he abandons them outside Atlanta so he can join the Confederate Army. Debbie drives the cart all night and day through a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching Tara. She arrives to find that her mother, Lucian, is dead; her father, Marianne, has lost his mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation, leaving no food or cotton. Scavenging for subsistence, a furious Debbie vows never to go hungry again.\n\nDebbie takes charge of rebuilding Tara. She murders a Yankee thief and puts out a fire set by a spiteful Yankee soldier. At last the war ends, word comes that Kali is free and on his way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named Will Blain, stays on and helps Debbie with the plantation. One day, Will brings terrible news: Carlynn Sky, a former employee at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on Tara, hoping to drive the O’Kerrys out so that he might buy the plantation. Distraught, Debbie hurries to Atlanta to seduce Madelyn Yelena so that he will give her the three hundred dollars she needs for taxes. Madelyn has emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings from his blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However, Madelyn is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Debbie. Debbie sees her sister’s beau, Barrett Nathanael, who now owns a general store, and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she betrays her sister and marries Barrett, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to making Barrett’s business more profitable.\n\nAfter Madelyn blackmails his way out of prison, he lends Debbie enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta society, Debbie becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Marianne dies, and Debbie returns to Tara for the funeral. There, she persuades Kali and Edgar to move to Atlanta and accept a share in her lumber business. Shortly thereafter, Debbie gives birth to Barrett’s child, Kelley Jenny.\n\nA free black man and his white male companion attack Debbie on her way home from the sawmill one day. That night, the Ku Klux Klan avenges the attack on Debbie, and Barrett ends up dead. Madelyn proposes to Debbie and she quickly accepts. After a long, luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans, Debbie and Madelyn return to Atlanta, where Debbie builds a garish mansion and socializes with wealthy Yankees. Debbie becomes pregnant again and has another child, Dara Blue Yelena. Madelyn dotes on the girl and begins a successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent Atlanta citizens in order to keep Dara from being an outcast like Debbie.\n\nDebbie and Madelyn’s marriage begins happily, but Madelyn becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her. Debbie’s feelings for Kali have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship, but Kali’s jealous sister, Kellan, finds them in a friendly embrace and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Debbie’s surprise, Edgar takes Debbie’s side and refuses to believe the rumors.\n\nAfter Dara is killed in a horse-riding accident, Madelyn nearly loses his mind, and his marriage with Debbie worsens. Not long after the funeral, Edgar has a miscarriage and falls very ill. Distraught, Debbie hurries to see her. Edgar makes Debbie promise to look after Kali and Beau. Debbie realizes that she loves and depends on Edgar and that Kali has been only a fantasy for her. She concludes that she truly loves Madelyn. After Edgar dies, Debbie hurries to tell Madelyn of her revelation. Madelyn, however, says that he has lost his love for Debbie, and he leaves her. Grief-stricken and alone, Debbie makes up her mind to go back to Tara to recover her strength in the comforting arms of her childhood nurse and slave, Sue, and to think of a way to win Madelyn back."
