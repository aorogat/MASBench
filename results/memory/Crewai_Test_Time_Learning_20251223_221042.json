The film also explores themes of friendship, ambition, and teamwork from a distinctly female perspective, giving audiences a different take on the classic heist narrative."

The movie’s comedy comes mainly from the characters’ banter, the parody of fairy‑tale tropes, and the chemistry between the leads.  \n\nEddie Murphy voices Donkey, one of the film’s central comedic characters. His performance is widely praised for its energy, timing, and the way he brings a distinct, humorous personality to the role. If you enjoy his style, Donkey is definitely worth watching."

      "system_answer": [
        "The rate you see at a foreign ATM is usually the bank’s own “ATM rate,” which is often a few basis points higher than the inter‑bank rate. Banks add a small markup to cover the cost of providing the service, and the rate can also be affected by the ATM operator’s own fee structure. Additionally, if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion (DCC), it may apply a different rate that includes a conversion fee. Therefore, the exchange rate you get at a foreign ATM is typically slightly worse than the market rate you would see on a currency‑exchange platform."

This fee can come from several sources:\n\n1. **Bank‑issued fee** – Many banks offer a limited number of free ATM withdrawals each month. Once you exceed that limit, a flat fee (e.g., $2–$5) or a percentage of the withdrawal amount is applied.\n\n2. **ATM operator fee** – If you use an ATM that is not part of your bank’s network, the operator may add its own surcharge (often a flat fee or a small percentage).\n\n3. **Foreign‑ATM fee** – When you withdraw cash abroad, the local ATM operator and your home bank may each add a fee. Some banks also add a currency‑conversion fee if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion (DCC).\n\n4. **Inter‑bank fee** – For certain card types (e.g., debit cards linked to a different bank), an inter‑bank fee may be charged for the transaction.\n\nTo understand the exact charge:\n\n- **Check your bank’s fee schedule** – It’s usually available on the bank’s website or in the account terms.\n- **Review the ATM receipt** – It often lists the fee applied.\n- **Contact customer service** – Provide the transaction ID and ask for a breakdown of the fee.\n\nIf you believe the fee is incorrect, you can dispute it with your bank, but most ATM withdrawal fees are standard and non‑refundable unless the ATM was malfunctioning or the transaction was fraudulent."

Once you exceed that limit, a flat fee (e.g., $2–$5) or a percentage of the withdrawal amount is applied.\n\n2. **ATM operator fee** – If you use an ATM that is not part of your bank’s network, the operator may add its own surcharge (often a flat fee or a small percentage).\n\n3. **Foreign‑ATM fee** – When you withdraw cash abroad, the local ATM operator and your home bank may each add a fee. Some banks also add a currency‑conversion fee if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion (DCC).\n\n4. **Inter‑bank fee** – For certain card types (e.g., debit cards linked to a different bank), an inter‑bank fee may be charged for the transaction.\n\nTo understand the exact charge:\n\n- **Check your bank’s fee schedule** – It’s usually available on the bank’s website or in the account terms.\n- **Review the ATM receipt** – It often lists the fee applied.\n- **Contact customer service** – Provide the transaction ID and ask for a breakdown of the fee.\n\nIf you believe the fee is incorrect, you can dispute it with your bank, but most ATM withdrawal fees are standard and non‑refundable unless the ATM was malfunctioning or the transaction was fraudulent."

If it remains on your statement:\n\n1. **Check the merchant name** on the statement for clues (e.g., “Amazon Payments,” “Apple,” “Google,” etc.).\n2. **Look for a receipt or confirmation email** that might explain the $1 test.\n3. **Contact the merchant** using the customer‑service number or email listed on their website; ask why the $1 charge was applied.\n4. **If the merchant cannot explain it**, call your bank or card issuer.

        "If your top‑up isn’t working, try the following steps to identify and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check your internet connection** – A weak or unstable connection can interrupt the top‑up request.  \n2. **Verify the card details** – Make sure the card number, expiry date, CVV, and billing address match exactly what the bank has on file.  \n3. **Confirm available balance** – Some cards have a daily or monthly top‑up limit; if you’ve reached that cap, the transaction will be declined.  \n4. **Look for card restrictions** – Certain cards are blocked for online or international payments. Contact your card issuer to ensure it’s enabled for top‑ups.  \n5. **Review app or platform status** – Check the service’s status page or social media for any known outages or maintenance that could affect top‑ups.  \n6. **Try a different card** – If you have another debit/credit card, attempt the top‑up with it to see if the issue is card‑specific.  \n7. **Clear app cache or reinstall** – Corrupted data can cause errors; clearing the cache or reinstalling the app often resolves the problem.  \n8. **Check for pending authorisations** – Some banks place a temporary hold on the amount; wait a few minutes and try again.  \n9. **Contact customer support** – If none of the above steps work, reach out to the app’s help centre or your bank’s support team with the error message or transaction ID. They can check for compliance holds, fraud flags, or other issues that may be blocking the top‑up.  \n\nFollow these steps in order, and you should be able to pinpoint why the top‑up isn’t working and get it completed."

If it remains on your statement:\n\n1. **Check the merchant name** on the statement for clues (e.g., “Amazon Payments,” “Apple,” “Google,” etc.).\n2. **Look for a receipt or confirmation email** that might explain the $1 test.\n3. **Contact the merchant** using the customer‑service number or email listed on their website; ask why the $1 charge was applied.\n4. **If the merchant cannot explain it**, call your bank or card issuer. Provide the transaction details and request a reversal if it was not authorized.\n\nMost $1 charges are harmless and will disappear automatically, but following these steps ensures you’re not charged for something you didn’t authorize."

Common reasons include:  \n\n1. **Insufficient available credit or funds** – the purchase would exceed your limit or your account balance.  \n2. **Expired or inactive card** – the card’s validity period has lapsed or the account has been closed.  \n3. **Suspected fraud or security flag** – the issuer detected unusual activity and blocked the transaction.  \n4. **Merchant error** – the point‑of‑sale system sent an incorrect amount or duplicate authorization.  \n\nWhat to do next:  \n\n- **Check your statement** for the declined transaction and any notes from the issuer.  \n- **Contact the merchant** to confirm the purchase details and ensure they sent the correct authorization.  \n- **Call your card issuer** (the number on the back of the card) to ask why the payment was declined and to verify your account status.  \n- **If the decline was a mistake**, request the issuer to re‑authorize the transaction or to issue a new card if the card is expired.  \n\nOnce the issuer resolves the issue, the payment can be captured and posted to your account."

        "To get your paycheck deposited through the payroll system, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify your direct‑deposit information**  \n   - Log into your employer’s payroll portal or HR system.  \n   - Confirm that your bank routing number, account number, and account type (checking/savings) are correct.  \n   - If you’re using a new bank, update the details and submit the change for approval.\n\n2. **Check the payroll schedule**  \n   - Note the pay‑date and the cut‑off date for submitting any changes.  \n   - If you’re close to the cut‑off, contact HR immediately to ensure your new details are processed in time.\n\n3. **Confirm the payroll batch status**  \n   - In the portal, look for a “Payroll Status” or “Direct Deposit” section.  \n   - Verify that your paycheck is listed as “Pending” or “Scheduled” for the upcoming pay‑date.\n\n4. **Ensure your bank account is active**  \n   - Verify that the account is open, not closed or frozen, and has sufficient funds to receive the deposit.  \n   - If the account is new, some banks require a minimum balance or a waiting period before accepting direct deposits.\n\n5. **Contact HR or payroll support if needed**  \n   - If your paycheck still does not appear after the scheduled date, reach out to the payroll or HR department with your employee ID and the date of the expected deposit.  \n   - Ask for a confirmation that the payroll batch was processed and that your account was included.\n\n6. **Check for any holds or compliance issues**  \n   - Some employers place a temporary hold on new direct‑deposit accounts for compliance checks.  \n   - If a hold exists, provide any requested documentation (e.g., a copy of your bank statement or a signed authorization form).\n\n7. **Verify the deposit in your bank account**  \n   - Once the payroll batch is processed, log into your online banking or mobile app.  \n   - Look for a credit entry that matches the amount of your paycheck.  \n   - If the deposit is missing, provide the transaction ID or payroll reference number to your bank for investigation.\n\nBy ensuring your direct‑deposit details are correct, confirming the payroll schedule, and following up with HR and your bank if necessary, you can get your paycheck through the system smoothly."

If the transaction is approved, the card is active.  \n3. **Verify the PIN** – if you’re prompted for a PIN, enter it. A successful PIN entry confirms the chip is functioning.  \n4. **Look for recent activity** – check your recent transaction history. If you see a pending or completed transaction that matches a recent purchase, the card is working.  \n5. **Contact customer service** – call the number on the back of the card or use the in‑app chat to confirm the card’s status and report any issues.  \n6. **Check for physical damage** – ensure the card’s chip, magnetic stripe, and contactless antenna are intact; any visible damage can affect functionality.  \n\nIf any of these checks fail, contact your bank immediately to resolve the issue."

First, many banks allow only a limited number of free withdrawals per month; after that, they charge a flat fee or a percentage of the amount. Second, if you use an ATM that isn’t part of your bank’s network, the operator may add its own surcharge, usually a flat fee or a small percentage. Third, when you withdraw cash abroad, both the local ATM operator and your home bank may add fees, and if the ATM uses dynamic currency conversion, a currency‑conversion fee may also apply. Finally, for certain card types, an inter‑bank fee may be charged. To see the exact charge, check your bank’s fee schedule, review the ATM receipt, or contact customer service with the transaction ID. If you believe the fee is incorrect, you can dispute it with your bank."

        "Double‑charging can happen when a merchant processes the same transaction twice, when a payment gateway resubmits a failed authorization, or when a card is used in a split‑payment scenario that records two separate charges. To resolve the issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify the transaction details** – Check the date, amount, merchant name, and transaction ID on your statement.  \n2. **Cross‑check your purchase records** – Compare the statement entries with your receipts or order confirmations to confirm a duplicate.  \n3. **Contact the merchant** – Call or email the restaurant’s customer service, provide the transaction IDs, and request a refund for the duplicate charge.  \n4. **If the merchant does not resolve the issue** – Contact your bank or card issuer. Provide the duplicate transaction details and ask for a chargeback or reversal.  \n5. **Monitor your account** – Keep an eye on subsequent statements to confirm the duplicate has been removed and the refund has been posted.  \n\nAct promptly, as most banks can investigate and correct double charges within a few business days."

      "system_answer": [
        "**What oil do I need for my Ford truck?**  \n- **Check the owner’s manual** – it lists the exact viscosity and type.  \n- For most modern Ford pickups (F‑150, Ranger, Super Duty, etc.) the recommended oil is **5W‑20** (or 5W‑30 for older engines or those that run hotter).  \n- Use a **full‑synthetic** or **synthetic‑blend** oil that meets the Ford specification **WSS-M2C172‑X** (or the equivalent for your model year).  \n- If you have a diesel‑powered Ford (e.g., F‑250 Super Duty with a 6.7‑L Power Stroke), use a **diesel engine oil** such as **5W‑30** that meets **Ford 9W‑30** or **WSS‑M2C172‑X**.  \n\n**How to change the oil**  \n1. **Warm up the engine** for a few minutes to let the oil flow.  \n2. **Secure the truck** on a level surface, engage the parking brake, and place wheel chocks.  \n3. **Lift the front** (or rear, if you’re changing the rear‑wheel‑drive oil) with a jack and secure with jack stands.  \n4. **Locate the oil drain plug** under the engine block. Place a drain pan beneath it.  \n5. **Remove the drain plug** with a socket wrench, let the oil drain completely (usually 5–10 min).  \n6. **Replace the drain plug** and tighten to the manufacturer’s torque spec (typically 20–25 ft‑lb).  \n7. **Remove the oil filter** with an oil filter wrench; let the remaining oil drain.  \n8. **Install a new filter** – apply a small amount of new oil to the rubber seal, hand‑tighten, then give an additional ¾ turn.  \n9. **Add new oil** – open the hood, locate the oil filler cap, and pour the recommended amount (check the dipstick for the exact volume).  \n10. **Start the engine** and let it run for a minute; check for leaks around the drain plug and filter.  \n11. **Turn off the engine** and wait a few minutes for the oil to settle.  \n12. **Check the oil level** with the dipstick, add more if needed, then replace the cap.  \n13. **Dispose of the old oil** properly – take it to a recycling center or auto shop that accepts used oil.  \n\n**Quick tips**  \n- Use a **new oil filter** each time you change oil.  \n- Keep a **log** of oil changes (date, mileage, oil type).  \n- If you’re unsure about the exact oil spec, call a Ford dealer or look up your VIN on Ford’s website.  \n\nThis procedure will keep your Ford truck’s engine lubricated, running smoothly, and help maintain warranty coverage."

Add more oil if needed.  \n\n11. **Dispose of Old Oil**  \n    - Transfer the used oil to a sealed container and take it to a recycling center or auto shop that accepts used oil.  \n\n**Quick Tips**  \n- Use a new oil filter each time.  \n- Keep a log of oil changes (date, mileage, oil type).  \n- If unsure about the oil spec, check the owner’s manual, the fuel door label, or your VIN on the manufacturer’s website.  \n\nFollowing these steps will keep your engine lubricated, running smoothly, and help maintain warranty coverage."

        "**How to Cash In Credit Card Points**\n\n1. **Check Your Card’s Rewards Program**  \n   - Log into your online banking or rewards portal.  \n   - Verify that your card allows cash‑back or statement‑credit redemption (most major issuers—Chase, American Express, Capital One, Citi, etc.—do).\n\n2. **Choose the Redemption Option**  \n   - **Statement Credit**: Apply points directly to your credit card balance.  \n   - **Cash Transfer**: Some issuers let you transfer points to a linked bank account (often at a 1:1 or 1:2 value).  \n   - **Gift Cards or Merchandise**: If cash isn’t available, you can often redeem for gift cards and then use those for purchases.\n\n3. **Redeem Online or via Mobile App**  \n   - Navigate to the “Rewards” or “Redeem” section.  \n   - Select “Cash” or “Statement Credit.”  \n   - Enter the amount of points you wish to redeem (most programs require a minimum, e.g., 1,000 points).\n\n4. **Confirm and Wait for Processing**  \n   - After confirming, the credit usually appears on your next statement or within a few business days.  \n   - If transferring to a bank account, it may take 3–5 business days.\n\n5. **Keep Track of Point Expiration**  \n   - Some programs expire points after a period of inactivity. Redeem before the deadline to avoid loss.\n\n**Quick Tips**  \n- **Value**: Cash or statement credit typically offers 1 cent per point.  \n- **Avoid Fees**: Some issuers charge a small fee for cash transfers; check the terms.  \n- **Combine with Other Offers**: Use points for cash while also taking advantage of bonus categories or promotional matches for maximum value."

Remove and set aside.\n\n5. **Make the sauce**  \n   - In the same skillet, pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits.  \n   - Stir in the heavy cream and Dijon mustard, bringing to a gentle simmer.  \n   - Let the sauce reduce slightly, about 3–4 minutes, until it thickens a bit.\n\n6. **Finish and serve**  \n   - Return the chicken rolls to the skillet, spooning sauce over them.  \n   - Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).  \n   - Remove toothpicks or twine, slice the roulades into rounds if desired, and drizzle with the sauce.  \n   - Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately with your choice of sides (e.g., mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a fresh salad)."

        "If your card is lost, act quickly to protect your account and get a replacement. 1) **Block or freeze the card immediately** – use your bank’s mobile app or online banking portal, or call the 24/7 customer‑service number (often found on the back of the card or on the bank’s website). 2) **Report the loss** – when you call or chat, tell the representative that the card is lost and request a new one. 3) **Confirm your identity** – you may be asked to verify personal details or answer security questions. 4) **Ask about delivery options** – most banks will ship a new card within 5–7 business days; some offer expedited shipping for a fee. 5) **Check for unauthorized activity** – review recent transactions and report any suspicious charges. 6) **Update any linked services** – if you use the card for auto‑pay or a digital wallet, update the new card details once it arrives. 7) **Keep a record** – note the reference number given by the bank for your report and any follow‑up actions. If you have a specific bank, use their dedicated lost‑card hotline or the “Report a lost card” feature in their app for the fastest resolution."

Federal lands (managed by agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, or National Park Service) generally allow only prospecting or small-scale, non‑commercial mining under specific regulations, and even that requires permits, fees, and compliance with environmental and safety rules. State lands may have their own rules, but most require a mining claim, a lease, or a special permit. In short, you must secure the proper legal authorization before you can legally mine for gold on public land."

It is caused by an aphthovirus of the Picornaviridae family, with seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia1). The disease is characterized by fever, vesicular lesions on the mouth, feet, teats, and hooves, and can lead to lameness, decreased milk production, and reproductive losses. FMD spreads rapidly through direct contact, aerosols, contaminated feed, and fomites. Control measures include vaccination, movement restrictions, culling of infected and exposed animals, and strict biosecurity protocols. The disease has significant economic impacts on livestock production and trade, and outbreaks are monitored and reported to international bodies such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)."

The virus is transmitted primarily through the fecal‑oral route, often via contaminated water or food, and can also spread through person‑to‑person contact. After infection, the virus replicates in the oropharynx and intestinal tract, then may invade the central nervous system. While most infections are asymptomatic or result in mild flu‑like symptoms, a small proportion lead to paralytic poliomyelitis, characterized by sudden onset of flaccid paralysis, often affecting the legs, and can result in permanent disability or death. The disease is preventable through vaccination with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), and global eradication efforts have dramatically reduced its incidence worldwide."

They are typically made from crystalline silicon (monocrystalline or polycrystalline) or thin‑film materials such as amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). When photons strike the semiconductor, they excite electrons, creating electron‑hole pairs that are separated by an internal electric field at a p‑n junction. This separation generates a flow of electrons (current) that can be harnessed as direct current (DC) electricity. Solar cells are assembled into modules and panels to increase power output, and they can be integrated into building materials, portable devices, or large utility‑scale solar farms."

The disease is primarily transmitted through contaminated feed containing animal protein, and it can be transmitted to humans as variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD). Control measures include strict feed bans, surveillance programs, and culling of infected or exposed animals."

Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar, typically present at about 5–8 % by volume, and is widely used as a food preservative, flavoring agent, and in industrial processes such as the production of vinyl acetate monomer, solvents, and as a reagent in organic synthesis. Its physical properties include a boiling point of 118.1 °C, a melting point of 16.6 °C, and a characteristic pungent, sour odor."

The virus primarily spreads via the fecal‑oral route, often through contaminated food or water, and can also be transmitted by direct contact with an infected individual. Once inside the body, poliovirus replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa before potentially invading the central nervous system. While many infections are asymptomatic or result in mild flu‑like symptoms, a small proportion can lead to paralytic poliomyelitis, characterized by sudden onset of flaccid paralysis that may affect the limbs, respiratory muscles, or other motor nerves. The disease can cause permanent disability or death if respiratory muscles are involved. Polio is preventable through vaccination, and global eradication efforts have dramatically reduced its incidence worldwide."

        "Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells, are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly into electrical energy through the photovoltaic effect. They typically consist of one or more layers of materials such as crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, or thin‑film compounds (e.g., cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide). When photons from sunlight strike the cell, they excite electrons in the semiconductor, creating electron‑hole pairs. An internal electric field—created by doping the semiconductor to form a p‑n junction—drives the electrons toward the n‑type side and the holes toward the p‑type side, generating a flow of current when the cell is connected to an external circuit. Solar cells are the fundamental building blocks of solar panels and are used in a wide range of applications from small portable devices to large utility‑scale power plants."

It is caused by an abnormal prion protein that induces misfolding of normal prion proteins in the brain, leading to sponge‑like lesions. The disease is transmitted primarily through contaminated feed containing animal protein, and it can be transmitted to humans as variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD) through consumption of infected beef products. Symptoms in cattle include weight loss, behavioral changes, and ataxia, and the disease is invariably fatal. Control measures focus on strict feed bans, surveillance, and culling of infected or exposed animals."
