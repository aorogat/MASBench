      "system_answer": "Hey there! 🎬\n\nIt sounds like you’re in the mood for a solid, serious mob drama. The classic that everyone talks about is **“The Godfather” (1972)** – it’s the definitive gangster epic, and it’s definitely worth watching if you haven’t already. (Just a quick note: there isn’t a “Godfather” from 1991— the original is 1972, and the sequel “The Godfather Part II” came out in 1974.)\n\nIf you’re looking for a few more options, here are some top‑tier mob movies that lean toward the serious side:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it’s a good pick |\n|------|------|----------------------|\n| **Goodfellas** | 1990 | Martin Scorsese’s gritty, fast‑paced look at the rise and fall of a New York gangster. |\n| **The Departed** | 2006 | A modern, tense crime thriller set in Boston’s underworld, also by Scorsese. |\n| **Casino** | 1995 | A deep dive into the casino business and mob control in Las Vegas. |\n| **The Irishman** | 2019 | A long‑form, reflective look at organized crime over decades, starring De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. |\n| **The Untouchables** | 1987 | A stylized, 1930s‑era take on the fight against Al Capone. |\n| **Once Upon a Time in America** | 1984 | A sprawling, epic tale of Jewish gangsters in New York. |\n| **The Godfather Part II** | 1974 | A sequel that’s often considered as strong as the original, blending past and present. |\n| **The Godfather Part III** | 1990 | The final chapter—less acclaimed but still a solid, dramatic conclusion. |\n\nIf you’re open to a slightly lighter tone but still serious, **“The Sopranos”** (TV series) is a modern, character‑driven look at mob life, though it’s a series rather than a film.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re after a particular era or actor. Happy watching! 🚀",

      "system_answer": "Encino Man is a light‑hearted, 90s‑style comedy that’s become a bit of a cult favorite. It follows a caveman (played by Brendan Fraser) who is thawed out and ends up living with a group of high‑school kids in Encino, California. The film mixes goofy prehistoric antics with the typical teenage drama of the era—think “The Sandlot” meets “The Goonies.”\n\nIf he enjoys Encino Man, here are a few other 90s teen/coming‑of‑age comedies that might hit the same sweet spot:\n\n| Movie | Year | Why it’s similar |\n|-------|------|------------------|\n| **Clueless** | 1995 | A modern, witty take on *Emma* set in a Beverly Hills high school. |\n| **10 Things I Hate About You** | 1999 | A high‑school romantic comedy that riffs on *The Taming of the Shrew*. |\n| **The Wedding Singer** | 1998 | A rom‑com with a 80s vibe, starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. |\n| **American Pie** | 1999 | A raunchier, but still classic, teen comedy about a group of friends. |\n| **The Sandlot** | 1993 | A nostalgic look at childhood summer adventures, with a strong ensemble cast. |\n| **The Goonies** | 1985 | A bit earlier, but the adventure‑comedy mix is a great fit for a “dumb cult classic” vibe. |\n\nIf he’s into the “dumb cult classic” feel of *The Pirate Movie*, you might also suggest:\n\n- **The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle** (2000) – a goofy, action‑comedy mash‑up.  \n- **The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai** (1984) – a quirky sci‑fi action film with a cult following.  \n- **The Last Dragon** (1985) – a martial‑arts comedy‑drama that’s become a cult favorite.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more recommendations or if there’s a particular sub‑genre he’s leaning toward!",

If you’re looking for a classic DC‑themed action film, here are a few great “old” options:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it’s a good pick |\n|------|------|----------------------|\n| **Batman** (Michael Keaton) | 1989 | A stylish, campy take on the Caped Crusader that set the tone for modern superhero movies. |\n| **Batman Returns** (Danny DeVito) | 1992 | A darker, more gothic sequel that’s still a fun, action‑packed ride. |\n| **Superman** (Christopher Reeve) | 1978 | The original superhero epic that introduced the genre to mainstream audiences. |\n| **Batman: The Movie** (1966) | 1966 | A campy, 60s‑style romp that’s great for a light‑hearted watch. |\n| **The Dark Knight** (Christian Bale) | 2008 | A slightly newer film, but still “old” enough to feel like a classic; it’s a gritty, high‑stakes Batman story. |\n\nIf you want something that’s a bit older than 2010 but still packed with action, **Batman (1989)** is a solid choice. If you’re up for a slightly newer but still classic feel, **The Dark Knight (2008)** is a must‑watch. Let me know which one you’d like to dive into, or if you want more options!",

Its eerie atmosphere and iconic imagery set the standard for horror. |\n| **Dracula** | 1931 | The first major Hollywood adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel. It’s atmospheric, gothic, and still chills. |\n| **The Wolf Man** | 1941 | A classic monster movie that blends horror with a tragic, human story. |\n| **Psycho** | 1960 | Hitchcock’s masterclass in suspense and psychological terror. The shower scene is legendary. |\n| **The Thing** | 1982 | A tense, claustrophobic sci‑fi horror that’s become a cult classic. |\n| **The Shining** | 1980 | A psychological horror that’s as unsettling as it is visually stunning. |\n| **It** | 1990 | A faithful adaptation of Stephen King’s novel that still feels fresh and creepy. |\n| **The Mask** | 1994 | A comedic‑horror hybrid starring Jim Carrey. It’s a fun, light‑hearted break from the darker classics. |\n| **The Others** | 2001 | A modern gothic horror that pays homage to the classics while delivering a fresh twist. |\n| **The Babadook** | 2014 | A psychological horror that’s both chilling and emotionally resonant. |\n\n### Quick Tips for Watching Classic Horror\n\n1. **Set the mood** – dim the lights, maybe have a bowl of popcorn, and keep a flashlight handy (just for fun, of course!).\n2. **Check the runtime** – many classics are shorter (under 90 min), so you can fit a couple in one evening.\n3. **Watch with a friend** – the shared “shivers” are even better when you can scream together.\n\n### If you’re in the mood for something a bit lighter\n\n- **The Mask** (1994) – you already mentioned it, but it’s a great blend of comedy and supernatural fun.\n- **Ghostbusters** (1984) – a classic comedy‑horror that’s still a crowd‑pleaser.\n- **Beetlejuice** (1988) – a quirky, Tim‑Burton horror‑comedy that’s both spooky and hilarious.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re looking for something in a different sub‑genre (e.g., slasher, supernatural, psychological).

The adventure takes them from Las Vegas to a remote cabin, and the trio must navigate a series of increasingly absurd obstacles to get the briefcase back.\n\n**Super Troopers (2001)**  \nA group of quirky state troopers in Vermont are more interested in pranks and beer than policing.
