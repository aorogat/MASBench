      "system_answer": "Hi there! 🎬\n\nIt sounds like you’re in the mood for a serious mob‑themed film. Here are a few solid options that range from classic to more recent:\n\n| Film | Year | Why it fits |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| **The Godfather** | 1972 | The definitive mob epic. If you haven’t seen it yet, it’s a must‑watch. |\n| **The Godfather Part II** | 1974 | A direct sequel that deep‑dives into the Corleone family’s rise and fall. |\n| **Goodfellas** | 1990 | Martin Scorsese’s gritty, fast‑paced look at the New York mob. |\n| **The Departed** | 2006 | A tense crime thriller set in Boston’s underworld. |\n| **Casino** | 1995 | A sprawling tale of Las Vegas, organized crime, and betrayal. |\n| **The Irishman** | 2019 | A long‑form, reflective look at mob life over decades (Netflix). |\n| **Once Upon a Time in America** | 1984 | A stylish, epic saga of Jewish gangsters in New York. |\n| **The Sopranos** (TV series) | 1999‑2007 | If you’re open to a series, it’s a deep dive into mob life and family dynamics. |\n\n### Quick note on the “1991 Godfather”\nThere isn’t a *Godfather* film released in 1991. The closest is **The Godfather Part III**, which came out in 1990. If you’re looking for that, it’s a more introspective, less action‑heavy continuation of the saga.\n\n---\n\n**What’s your preference?**  \n- Do you want a classic (70s‑80s) or something newer?  \n- Are you okay with a TV series, or strictly a movie?  \n- Any particular actors or sub‑genres (e.g., crime‑thriller vs. period drama) you’re drawn to?\n\nLet me know, and I can narrow it down further!",

The film is more atmospheric and intense than the 1990 TV miniseries, with a stronger focus on the kids’ friendships and the psychological horror of confronting childhood fears.

      "system_answer": "Shrek is a great pick for a “childish” night in—it's a PG‑rated, family‑friendly film that still has plenty of laughs for adults.\n\n**Fart jokes?**  \nThere are a few light‑hearted, “gross‑out” moments (the classic donkey‑fart gag in the swamp, the “fart‑scented” swamp scene, etc.), but they’re not the main focus. The humor is mostly wordplay, pop‑culture references, and the banter between Shrek and Donkey. So you won’t find a flood of explicit fart jokes—just a few playful nods that keep the tone light.\n\n**Eddie Murphy as Donkey**  \nEddie Murphy’s voice work is a big part of the film’s charm. He brings a lot of energy, improvisation, and a distinct comedic style to Donkey. Most viewers find his performance a highlight, and it’s one of the reasons the film has remained popular over the years. If you’re a fan of Murphy’s stand‑up or his other voice roles (like in *The Simpsons* or *The Incredibles*), you’ll likely enjoy his work in Shrek.\n\n**Why it’s a solid choice**  \n- **Family‑friendly**: No graphic content, just PG‑rated humor.  \n- **Mix of humor styles**: From slapstick to clever wordplay.  \n- **Iconic characters**: Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and the supporting cast.  \n- **Rewatchable**: The jokes and references keep coming back.\n\nIf you’re looking for something similar, you might also enjoy:\n\n| Film | Why it’s similar |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Shrek 2** (2004) | Same characters, more pop‑culture jokes |\n| **The Princess Bride** (1987) | Fairy‑tale parody with witty dialogue |\n| **Monsters, Inc.** (2001) | Animated comedy with a fun, family‑friendly vibe |\n| **Despicable Me** (2010) | Animated humor with a lovable sidekick (Gru’s minions) |\n\nEnjoy your movie night—Shrek is a safe bet for a light, fun, and slightly mischievous film!",

      "system_answer": "Hey there! I’m doing great—thanks for asking. How can I help you pick out the next family‑friendly movie to watch together?\n\nYou mentioned *Finding Dory* and *The Incredibles* (and the upcoming *Incredibles 2*). Those are both solid animated adventures that kids love. If you’re looking for more titles in that vein, here are a few suggestions that work well for a family movie night:\n\n| Movie | Year | Why it’s a good fit | Where to watch (if you’re looking for a streaming option) |\n|-------|------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Toy Story** (1995) | Classic Pixar animation, heart‑warming story about toys coming to life. | Great for all ages, lots of humor and a sweet message about friendship. | Disney+ |\n| **Monsters, Inc.** (2001) | Pixar’s first “monster” movie, fun and imaginative. | Kids love the monsters, adults appreciate the clever humor. | Disney+ |\n| **The LEGO Movie** (2014) | Bright, fast‑paced, and full of jokes. | Appeals to kids and adults alike; the LEGO world is a visual treat. | Disney+ |\n| **Paddington** (2014) | Live‑action/CGI mix, charming British humor. | Gentle, family‑friendly, and has a lovely moral about kindness. | Disney+ |\n| **How to Train Your Dragon** (2010) | Stunning animation, adventure, and a strong bond between a boy and a dragon. | Great for slightly older kids (8+), but younger ones can still enjoy the visuals. | Disney+ |\n| **The Princess Bride** (1987) | Classic fairy‑tale adventure with humor and romance. | A cult favorite that’s fun for all ages. | Disney+ |\n| **Spider‑Man: Into the Spider‑Verse** (2018) | Fresh animation style, superhero fun. | Kids love the action, and the animation is visually unique. | Disney+ |\n| **Coco** (2017) | Pixar’s musical about family and tradition. | Beautiful visuals, great music, and a touching story. | Disney+ |\n| **The Iron Giant** (1999) | Animated sci‑fi with a heartfelt story. | Kids love the giant robot, adults appreciate the emotional depth. | Disney+ |\n| **The Secret Life of Pets** (2016) | Animated comedy about what pets do when owners are away. | Light‑hearted, fun for younger kids. | Disney+ |\n\n### If you’re looking for something new or upcoming:\n- **Incredibles 2** (2018) – already out, but worth a re‑watch if you haven’t seen it yet.\n- **Raya and the Last Dragon** (2021) – a fresh animated adventure with a strong female lead.\n- **Luca** (2021) – a Pixar film about friendship and summer adventures in Italy.\n\n### Quick questions to tailor the list further:\n1. **What ages are your kids?** (Some titles are better for younger children, others for pre‑teens.)\n2. **Do you prefer animated movies, live‑action, or a mix?**\n3. **Are you looking for something currently in theaters, or are you fine with streaming?**\n\nLet me know your preferences, and I can narrow it down to a few perfect picks for your next family movie night!",
