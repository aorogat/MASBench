      "question": "What does target heart rate mean ?",
      "system_answer": "**Target heart rate** is the range of heart‑beat speeds you aim for while exercising to get the most benefit for your cardiovascular fitness and health.  \n\n- **Why it matters** – Working out at a heart rate that’s too low won’t challenge your heart enough, while a rate that’s too high can be unsafe or lead to over‑exertion.  \n- **How it’s calculated** –  \n  1. Estimate your maximum heart rate: **220 – your age** (e.g., a 30‑year‑old → 190 beats per minute).  \n  2. Choose a target zone, usually 50–85 % of that maximum.  \n     * 50–60 %: light‑to‑moderate activity (e.g., brisk walking).  \n     * 60–70 %: moderate intensity (e.g., jogging).  \n     * 70–80 %: vigorous intensity (e.g., running).  \n     * 80–85 %: very vigorous, often used for short bursts or interval training.  \n- **How to monitor** – Use a heart‑rate monitor, smartwatch, or manually check your pulse (e.g., count beats for 15 seconds and multiply by 4).  \n\nIn short, the target heart rate is the “sweet spot” for your heart during exercise, helping you train safely and effectively.",

Each enzyme is specific to a particular substrate or set of substrates and can be regulated by various factors (pH, temperature, inhibitors, activators, etc.).",

      "system_answer": "The Sun isn’t actually yellow – it emits a broad, nearly “white” spectrum of light.  \nWhat makes it look yellow to us on Earth is the way that light travels through our atmosphere.\n\n1. **Rayleigh scattering** – The shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered in all directions by the molecules and small particles in the air.  \n2. **Transmission of longer wavelengths** – The longer‑wavelength yellow, orange, and red photons pass through the atmosphere with less scattering, so they dominate the light that reaches our eyes.  \n3. **Human eye sensitivity** – Our eyes are most sensitive to yellow‑green light, so the Sun’s white light, after being filtered by the atmosphere, is perceived as yellow.\n\nAt sunrise or sunset the Sun’s light must travel through even more atmosphere, scattering out most of the blue and leaving a reddish‑orange hue. In space, where there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the Sun appears white.",

      "system_answer": "Foot‑and‑mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral illness that affects cloven‑hooved animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and deer. The virus causes fever, blisters (or “mouths”) in the mouth and on the tongue, and vesicles (blisters) on the feet and around the hooves. Infected animals can spread the disease through direct contact, airborne droplets, contaminated feed, water, or equipment. While the disease is usually mild in adult animals, it can cause severe economic losses in livestock production due to decreased weight gain, milk production, and reproductive performance, as well as trade restrictions. The virus is not transmissible to humans, but it can be carried by people, animals, and objects, so strict biosecurity measures are essential to control outbreaks.",

When light enters a prism, it is refracted (bent) at each interface, and because the surfaces are angled, the light emerges at a different direction. This refraction causes the light to spread out into its component colors (spectrum) if the prism is made of a material with a wavelength‑dependent refractive index (like glass or clear plastic). In optics, prisms are used for dispersion, beam steering, and as basic elements in devices such as spectrometers, binoculars, and cameras.",

It occurs when the protective mucus layer is damaged, allowing stomach acid to erode the tissue, leading to pain, bleeding, and sometimes complications if left untreated. Ulcers can be caused by factors such as Helicobacter pylori infection, prolonged use of non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress, smoking, or excessive alcohol consumption. Treatment typically involves medications to reduce stomach acid, antibiotics if H. pylori is present, and lifestyle changes.",

In other words, the interest is “compounded” or added to the principal, so that the next period’s interest is calculated on a larger base.\n\nMathematically, the future value \\(A\\) of an investment after \\(n\\) compounding periods at an interest rate \\(r\\) per period is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\times (1 + r)^n\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(P\\) = initial principal\n- \\(r\\) = interest rate per compounding period (expressed as a decimal)\n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods\n\nThe key idea is that the interest itself earns interest over time, leading to exponential growth of the investment.

      "question": "What is solar wind ?",
      "system_answer": "**Solar wind** is a continuous outflow of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—from the Sun’s outer atmosphere (the corona).  \n- It streams outward at speeds ranging from about 300 km/s in the slow solar wind to over 800 km/s in the fast wind.  \n- The particles carry the Sun’s magnetic field with them, forming the heliospheric magnetic field that permeates the entire solar system.  \n- When the solar wind encounters a planet’s magnetic field or atmosphere, it can compress the magnetosphere, generate auroras, and drive space‑weather effects such as geomagnetic storms.  \n- Solar wind is a key driver of the dynamic environment of the heliosphere and influences everything from satellite operations to radio communications on Earth.",

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": "Solar cells, also called photovoltaic (PV) cells, are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. When photons from the sun hit the cell, they excite electrons in the semiconductor material (usually silicon), creating electron‑hole pairs. An internal electric field—created by doping the semiconductor with different impurities—drives the electrons toward one side and the holes toward the other, producing a flow of electric current. By connecting many cells in series or parallel, they form solar panels that can power homes, businesses, or feed electricity into the grid.",

It is intended to help the employee transition to new employment or to cover living expenses while they search for a new job.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Feature | Typical Details |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Purpose** | Cushion the employee’s loss of income and provide a smoother transition. |\n| **Eligibility** | Often tied to length of service, position, or a specific termination reason (e.g., company downsizing). |\n| **Amount** | Can be a fixed sum, a multiple of the employee’s regular salary (e.g., one or two weeks’ pay per year of service), or a negotiated figure. |\n| **Duration** | Usually covers a set period (e.g., a few weeks or months) and may be paid in a lump sum or installments. |\n| **Taxation** | In many jurisdictions, severance pay is treated as taxable income. |\n| **Legal Requirements** | Some countries or states have laws mandating severance under certain conditions; otherwise it’s often a contractual or discretionary benefit. |\n| **Other Benefits** | May be bundled with continued health insurance, outplacement services, or other support. |\n\nIn short, severance pay is a form of compensation that helps employees manage the financial impact of losing their job.",
