      "system_answer": "The Sun itself isn’t actually yellow—it emits a broad spectrum of light that is essentially **white**.  \nWhat makes it look yellow to us on Earth is the way our atmosphere scatters that light.\n\n* **Rayleigh scattering**: The thin air molecules in the atmosphere scatter shorter‑wavelength (blue and violet) light far more efficiently than longer‑wavelength (red, orange, yellow) light.  \n* **Line‑of‑sight through the atmosphere**: When we look straight up at the Sun, the light passes through a relatively short path in the atmosphere, so the blue component is only slightly scattered and the Sun still looks white or very pale yellow.  \n* **At sunrise or sunset**: The Sun’s light has to travel through a much longer path in the atmosphere. Most of the blue light is scattered out of the line of sight, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) to dominate, so the Sun appears reddish or orange‑yellow.\n\nSo the Sun appears yellow to us mainly because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters away the blue part of its spectrum, leaving the yellow‑ish portion to dominate our view.",

Other countries may use similar thresholds but sometimes include additional factors such as contrast sensitivity or color vision.\n\n### Key points\n- **Best‑corrected**: The measurement is taken after the person has had the best possible glasses or contact lenses fitted.\n- **Not the same as blindness**: “Legally blind” is a legal status; many people who are legally blind have some usable vision and can lead independent lives.\n- **Variations**: Some states or programs may use a stricter acuity threshold (e.g., 20/400) or add other criteria (e.g., inability to read a standard print size).\n\nIf you need the exact definition for a specific jurisdiction (e.g., a particular U.S. state, Canada, or another country), let me know and I can provide the precise numbers used there.",

      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has been added to it over time. In other words, the interest “compounds” or accumulates on itself.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Principal** – the initial amount of money you invest or borrow.  \n2. **Interest rate** – the percentage at which interest is calculated.  \n3. **Compounding period** – how often the interest is added to the principal (e.g., annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, or continuously).\n\nAt each compounding period, the new balance (principal + accumulated interest) becomes the basis for calculating the next period’s interest. Over time, this leads to exponential growth of the investment or debt.\n\n### Formula\nFor discrete compounding (e.g., yearly, monthly):\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- \\(A\\) = amount after \\(t\\) years  \n- \\(P\\) = principal (initial amount)  \n- \\(r\\) = annual interest rate (decimal)  \n- \\(n\\) = number of compounding periods per year  \n- \\(t\\) = number of years\n\nFor continuous compounding:\n\n\\[\nA = P e^{rt}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(e\\) is the base of natural logarithms.\n\n### Example\nIf you invest \\$1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded monthly for 3 years:\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)\n- \\(r = 0.05\\)\n- \\(n = 12\\)\n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{12}\\right)^{12 \\times 3}\n  \\approx 1{,}161.62\n\\]\n\nSo you would have about \\$1,161.62 after 3 years, with the extra \\$161.62 coming from interest earned on both the original \\$1,000 and on the interest that accumulated each month.\n\n### Key Takeaway\nCompound interest magnifies growth (or debt) because each period’s interest is calculated on a larger base than the previous period. The more frequently interest compounds, the greater the effect.",

They are made from semiconductor materials—most commonly silicon—that absorb photons from the sun. When a photon hits the semiconductor, it excites an electron, creating an electron‑hole pair. The built‑in electric field at the junction of the cell pushes electrons toward one side and holes toward the other, generating a flow of electric current. By connecting many cells in series or parallel, solar panels can produce usable electrical power for homes, businesses, or grid‑scale applications.",
