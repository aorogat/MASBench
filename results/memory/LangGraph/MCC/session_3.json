Here’s what you can do right away:\n\n1. **Contact the airline**  \n   * Call the airline’s customer service or use their mobile app.  \n   * Provide your flight number, date, and any baggage claim tags you received.  \n   * Ask for the status of your luggage and file a “missing baggage” report if it hasn’t been filed yet.\n\n2. **File a claim**  \n   * Most airlines have an online claim form for lost or delayed luggage.  \n   * Keep a copy of the claim number and any reference numbers you receive.\n\n3. **Check the airport’s lost‑and‑found**  \n   * If you’re still at the airport, visit the lost‑and‑found desk.  \n   * If you’re already on the ground, call the airport’s lost‑and‑found office.\n\n4. **Track the claim**  \n   * Airlines usually provide a tracking number or an online portal where you can see updates.  \n   * If you don’t receive a response within 24–48 hours, follow up with the airline’s customer service.\n\n5. **Insurance**  \n   * If you have travel insurance or credit‑card travel coverage, contact them to see if you can file a claim for the contents or the luggage itself.\n\n6. **Keep documentation**  \n   * Save all receipts, boarding passes, baggage tags, and any correspondence.  \n   * This will help if you need to claim reimbursement.\n\nIf you let me know the airline and flight details, I can help you draft a quick message or find the right contact number.",

A card decline can happen for a few common reasons:\n\n1. **Insufficient funds or credit limit** – If the balance or available credit is too low, the transaction will be declined.  \n2. **Exceeded daily or monthly limits** – Some cards have daily spending or withdrawal limits that, if reached, will block further transactions.  \n3. **Expired or inactive card** – If your card has expired or hasn’t been activated yet, it won’t work.  \n4. **Suspicious activity** – Banks may flag a transaction that looks unusual (e.g., a large purchase, a foreign transaction, or a new merchant) and decline it until you confirm it’s legitimate.  \n5. **Technical issues** – Sometimes the payment terminal or network can have a hiccup, causing a temporary decline.  \n6. **Card not activated for online or contactless use** – If you’re trying to use the card in a way it hasn’t been set up for, it may be declined.  \n\n**What you can do:**\n\n- Double‑check the card’s balance and any limits.  \n- Verify that the card is active and not expired.  \n- If the transaction is large or unusual, contact your bank or card issuer to confirm it’s legitimate.  \n- Try a different payment method or card if possible.  \n- If the issue persists, call the customer‑service number on the back of your card for a quick explanation and resolution.  \n\nLet me know if you need help contacting your bank or if there’s anything else I can do!",

      "question": "please inform me on bad habits and overcoming them",
      "system_answer": "**Bad habits** are behaviors that feel comfortable or rewarding in the short‑term but ultimately hinder your goals, relationships, or well‑being. Common examples include:\n\n| Habit | Why it’s harmful | Quick win to start breaking it |\n|-------|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Procrastination** | Delays progress, increases stress | Use the *2‑minute rule*: if a task can be done in 2 minutes, do it now. |\n| **Over‑checking social media** | Wastes time, fuels comparison | Set a daily “screen‑time” limit and schedule “offline” blocks. |\n| **Skipping meals or snacking on junk food** | Leads to energy crashes, weight gain | Keep healthy snacks handy and plan meals ahead. |\n| **Negative self‑talk** | Lowers confidence, fuels anxiety | Practice a daily affirmation or keep a gratitude journal. |\n| **Smoking / excessive alcohol** | Health risks, financial cost | Replace the habit with a healthier cue (e.g., chew gum, take a walk). |\n| **Multitasking** | Reduces focus, lowers quality | Prioritize one task at a time; use a timer (Pomodoro). |\n| **Avoiding exercise** | Low energy, health decline | Start with 5‑minute walks, gradually increase. |\n| **Poor sleep hygiene** | Affects mood, cognition | Keep a consistent bedtime, limit screens 30 min before sleep. |\n\n---\n\n### 5‑Step Plan to Overcome a Bad Habit\n\n1. **Identify the Trigger**  \n   *Ask:* “When do I usually do this? What am I feeling or what’s happening around me?”  \n   *Example:* If you snack on chips when you’re bored, the trigger is “boredom.”\n\n2. **Replace, Don’t Remove**  \n   *Swap the habit for a healthier alternative that satisfies the same need.*  \n   *Example:* Replace chips with carrot sticks or a piece of fruit.\n\n3. **Set a Clear, Small Goal**  \n   *Make the change measurable and achievable.*  \n   *Example:* “I will eat a fruit snack instead of chips 3 times a week.”\n\n4. **Track Progress**  \n   *Use a habit tracker, journal, or app to mark each success.*  \n   *Seeing the streak grow boosts motivation.*\n\n5. **Reward & Reflect**  \n   *Give yourself a small reward for meeting the goal (e.g., a favorite podcast episode).  \n   *Reflect weekly: What worked? What needs tweaking?*\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips for Sustaining Change\n\n- **Accountability Partner** – Share your goal with a friend or family member who can check in.\n- **Visual Reminders** – Post sticky notes where you’ll see them (e.g., on the fridge, bathroom mirror).\n- **Mindful Pause** – Before acting on a habit, pause for 30 seconds and ask, “Is this the best choice right now?”\n- **Celebrate Small Wins** – Even a single day of success is progress; reward yourself modestly.\n- **Be Patient** – Habits can take 21–66 days to form; persistence is key.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Overcoming Procrastination\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Notice you’re procrastinating when you start scrolling instead of working. |\n| 2 | Replace scrolling with a 5‑minute “brain‑break” walk. |\n| 3 | Set a timer: 25 min work, 5 min break (Pomodoro). |\n| 4 | Log each Pomodoro session in a habit tracker. |\n| 5 | After 5 sessions, reward yourself with a short episode of a show you enjoy. |\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The goal isn’t to be perfect, but to make incremental, sustainable changes. Pick one habit to tackle first, apply the 5‑step plan, and once you feel confident, move on to the next. Good luck—you’ve got this!",
