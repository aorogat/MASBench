      "question": "Are there restrictions for my disposable card since it does not seem to be working?",
      "system_answer": "It’s frustrating when a disposable card just won’t go through. Let’s walk through the most common reasons it might be blocked and what you can do next.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Disposable cards are *only* for one‑off online purchases**\n\n| What you can do | What you can’t do |\n|-----------------|-------------------|\n| • Pay for a single online order (e‑commerce, subscription‑free services, etc.) | • Use it in a physical store or ATM |\n| • Use it for a single transaction per card number | • Use it for recurring or subscription payments |\n| • Use it for any merchant that accepts virtual cards | • Use it for merchants that block virtual or disposable cards (e.g., gambling, crypto, certain travel sites) |\n\nIf you tried to use the card in a shop or for a subscription, it will be declined.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Check the card’s status**\n\n1. **Open the app** (or website) and go to the “Cards” section.  \n2. Make sure the disposable card is **active** – it should say “Active” or “Ready to use.”  \n3. If it shows “Blocked” or “Expired,” you’ll need to generate a new disposable card.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Transaction limits**\n\n- **Maximum per transaction**: Usually a fixed amount (e.g., $5,000 or $10,000).  \n- **Daily/weekly limits**: Some issuers cap how many disposable cards you can create or how many transactions you can make in a period.\n\nIf your purchase exceeds the limit, the transaction will be declined. Check the app’s “Limits” or “Disposable card settings” to see the exact numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Merchant restrictions**\n\n- **Certain merchant categories** (gambling, adult content, crypto exchanges, high‑risk travel sites) often block disposable cards.  \n- **Geographic restrictions**: Some merchants only accept cards issued in specific countries.\n\nIf you’re buying something that falls into a restricted category, the card will be declined.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Technical hiccups**\n\n| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| “Card declined” with no error code | Card not activated or already used | Re‑activate or create a new disposable card |\n| “Insufficient funds” | The underlying account balance is too low | Add funds or use a different card |\n| “Payment failed” | Network or merchant gateway issue | Try again later or use a different payment method |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **What to do next**\n\n1. **Generate a new disposable card** in the app.  \n2. **Try a different merchant** that you know accepts virtual cards (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Spotify).  \n3. **Check your account balance** – make sure you have enough funds.  \n4. **Look for any error codes** in the app or on the merchant’s site; they often give clues.  \n5. **Contact support** if the problem persists:\n   - **In‑app chat** or **email** (usually found under “Help” or “Support”).\n   - Provide the transaction ID, merchant name, and the exact error message.\n\n---\n\n### Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can I use a disposable card for a subscription?** | No – disposable cards are single‑use only. |\n| **Do disposable cards have a daily limit?** | Yes, check your app for the exact limit. |\n| **What if my card is blocked?** | Generate a new disposable card; if it keeps blocking, contact support. |\n| **Can I use a disposable card for in‑store purchases?** | No – they’re only for online transactions. |\n\n---\n\nIf you let me know the exact error message or the merchant you’re trying to pay at, I can give you more tailored advice. Otherwise, try the steps above and you should be able to get it working in no time!",

      "question": "I'm trying to transfer money to another country. It's just pending and not sending. My account details are correct. Please help me.",
      "system_answer": "I’m sorry to hear that your international transfer is stuck in the “pending” state. Let’s try to pinpoint what’s going on and get it moving.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Quick Checklist\n\n| ✅ | Item | Why it matters |\n|----|------|----------------|\n| 1 | **Transfer ID / Reference** | Needed to look up the exact transaction in our system. |\n| 2 | **Recipient details** (IBAN/SWIFT, bank name, country) | A typo or missing field can trigger a hold. |\n| 3 | **Amount & Currency** | Some currencies or amounts trigger extra compliance checks. |\n| 4 | **Your account status** | Is your account fully verified? Are there any holds on it? |\n| 5 | **Recipient country** | Transfers to certain jurisdictions (e.g., high‑risk or sanctioned countries) are automatically reviewed. |\n| 6 | **Transfer type** | Is it a “standard” transfer, a “scheduled” transfer, or a “bulk” transfer? |\n\nIf you can confirm all of the above, we’ll have a clearer picture.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Reasons for a Pending International Transfer\n\n| Reason | What to Check | Typical Resolution |\n|--------|---------------|--------------------|\n| **Compliance / AML review** | Transfers to high‑risk countries or large amounts may be flagged. | Provide any requested documentation (e.g., source of funds). |\n| **Incorrect recipient details** | Wrong IBAN, SWIFT code, or missing account holder name. | Double‑check the details; correct and resubmit. |\n| **Currency mismatch** | Sending in a currency not supported by the recipient bank. | Convert to the recipient’s local currency or use a supported currency. |\n| **Recipient bank hold** | The receiving bank may have a temporary hold or is undergoing maintenance. | Wait 1–2 business days; contact the recipient bank if it’s been longer. |\n| **Transfer limit reached** | You’ve hit your daily/monthly transfer limit. | Wait until the limit resets or request a temporary increase. |\n| **Technical glitch** | System outage or processing delay. | Usually resolves within a few hours; check status in the app. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. What to Do Right Now\n\n1. **Open the app / website**  \n   - Go to **Transfers** → **Pending**.  \n   - Note the **Transfer ID** and any status message.\n\n2. **Verify recipient details**  \n   - IBAN, SWIFT/BIC, account holder name, and bank address.  \n   - If any field looks off, cancel the transfer (if possible) and create a new one.\n\n3. **Check your account status**  \n   - In **Profile** → **Verification**.  \n   - If you’re still in “Pending verification,” the transfer may be held until you complete it.\n\n4. **Look for an email or in‑app notification**  \n   - We often send a compliance notice asking for additional info.  \n   - Follow the link and upload the requested documents.\n\n5. **Contact Support**  \n   - If the transfer remains pending > 48 hrs, open a support ticket:  \n     - **In‑app chat** → “Help” → “Transfer Issues”  \n     - Or email: support@yourbank.com (replace with your actual bank’s email).  \n   - Include: Transfer ID, date, amount, currency, recipient country, and a screenshot of the pending status.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How Long Should It Take?\n\n| Transfer type | Typical processing time | Notes |\n|---------------|------------------------|-------|\n| **Standard SWIFT** | 1–3 business days | Depends on both banks’ cut‑off times. |\n| **SEPA (Euro)** | 1–2 business days | Usually faster. |\n| **Cross‑border to high‑risk country** | 3–5 business days | Extra compliance checks. |\n| **Scheduled transfer** | Same as above | If scheduled for a future date, it will only start then. |\n\nIf you’re past the upper bound of the typical window, that’s a good reason to reach out to support.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick Tips to Avoid Future Holds\n\n- **Double‑check IBAN/SWIFT** before confirming.  \n- **Keep your account verified** (upload ID, proof of address).  \n- **Stay within your transfer limits** or request an increase if you need larger amounts.  \n- **Use supported currencies** for the recipient’s country.  \n- **Avoid sending to restricted jurisdictions** unless you’re sure it’s compliant.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps for You\n\n1. Pull up the transfer details and note the ID.  \n2. Verify all recipient info.  \n3. Check for any compliance emails.  \n4. If everything looks good and it’s still pending >48 hrs, open a support ticket with the details above.\n\nLet me know what you find, and I’ll help you troubleshoot further!",

      "system_answer": "If you spot a withdrawal you don’t recognize, act fast.
