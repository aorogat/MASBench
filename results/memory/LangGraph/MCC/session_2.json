Here’s what you can do right away to keep your account safe:\n\n1. **Log out of the app**  \n   • If you still have access to the app on another device, log out from all devices.  \n   • If you can’t log in, go to the *Forgot passcode* or *Reset passcode* option on the login screen and follow the instructions.\n\n2. **Change your passcode**  \n   • Once you’re logged in on a new device, go to *Settings → Security → Passcode* and set a new, strong passcode.\n\n3. **Block or freeze your card**  \n   • In the app, tap the card you want to block and select *Freeze card* (or *Block card*).  \n   • If you can’t access the app, you can also call our support line or use the *Help & Support* chat in the app to request a card freeze.\n\n4. **Enable two‑factor authentication (2FA)**  \n   • If you haven’t already, enable 2FA in *Settings → Security*. This adds an extra layer of protection even if someone gets hold of your passcode.\n\n5. **Check recent activity**  \n   • Review recent transactions and top‑ups. If you see anything suspicious, report it immediately through the app’s *Report a problem* or *Help & Support* section.\n\n6. **Contact support**  \n   • If you’re unable to log in or need further assistance, reach out to our support team via the app or by calling the number on the back of your card. They can help you secure your account and, if necessary, issue a new card.\n\n7. **Keep your recovery email and phone number up to date**  \n   • Make sure the email address and phone number on file are current so we can reach you if anything unusual happens.\n\nIf you need any more help or have questions about a specific step, just let me know!",
