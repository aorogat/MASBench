      "question": "Why is the sun yellow ?",
      "system_answer": "The Sun itself doesn’t actually glow yellow—it emits a broad spectrum of light that is essentially **white**.  \nWhat makes the Sun appear yellow (or sometimes orange or red) to us on Earth is the way the Earth’s atmosphere interacts with that light:\n\n1. **Rayleigh scattering**  \n   The atmosphere contains molecules and very small particles that scatter shorter‑wavelength light (blue and violet) more strongly than longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).  \n   As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue component is scattered in all directions, leaving the light that reaches our eyes relatively richer in the longer wavelengths.\n\n2. **Atmospheric absorption**  \n   Water vapor, ozone, and other gases absorb some of the blue and ultraviolet light, further biasing the spectrum toward yellow‑orange.\n\n3. **Viewing angle**  \n   When the Sun is high in the sky, its light travels through less atmosphere, so the scattering effect is weaker and the Sun looks whiter.  \n   Near sunrise or sunset, the light must travel through a much thicker layer of air, scattering even more blue light and making the Sun appear orange or red.\n\n4. **Human perception**  \n   Our eyes are more sensitive to yellow‑orange light, and the presence of scattered blue light can actually make the Sun look slightly yellowish even when it’s high in the sky.\n\nSo, the Sun’s yellow appearance is a result of atmospheric scattering and absorption, not a property of the Sun itself.",

A sonar system emits a pulse of sound, then listens for echoes that bounce back from objects such as fish, submarines, or the seafloor. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal, the system can determine the distance, size, shape, and sometimes the material of the target. Sonar is widely used in navigation, depth sounding, underwater mapping, and military applications.",

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": "**Compound interest** is the interest you earn on both the original amount of money you invest (the principal) and on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or grows on top of itself over time.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Principal** – the initial amount of money you invest or deposit.  \n2. **Interest rate** – the percentage the bank or investment pays you per period.  \n3. **Compounding frequency** – how often the interest is added to the principal (e.g., annually, semi‑annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, or continuously).\n\nEach time interest is added, the new total becomes the basis for the next period’s interest calculation. Because the base amount is larger each time, the growth accelerates.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded annually:\n\n- **Year 1**: $1,000 × 5% = $50 → New balance = $1,050  \n- **Year 2**: $1,050 × 5% = $52.50 → New balance = $1,102.50  \n- **Year 3**: $1,102.50 × 5% = $55.13 → New balance ≈ $1,157.63  \n\nNotice how the interest earned each year increases because it’s calculated on a larger balance.\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Longer time horizons**: The longer the money stays invested, the more pronounced the compounding effect becomes.  \n- **Higher compounding frequency**: More frequent compounding (e.g., monthly vs. annually) yields slightly higher returns.  \n- **Higher rates**: Higher interest rates amplify the compounding benefit.\n\nCompound interest is a fundamental concept in savings, loans, mortgages, and investment growth, and it’s often summarized by the phrase “interest on interest.”",

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": "Alcohol is absorbed very quickly once it reaches the stomach and small intestine.  \n* **Stomach** – Roughly 20–30 % of the drink is absorbed here, mainly if the beverage is dilute or if the stomach is empty.  \n* **Small intestine** – The remaining 70–80 % is taken up almost immediately; the bulk of the absorption occurs in the first few centimeters of the duodenum and jejunum.  \n\n**Typical time‑course**\n\n| Event | Approximate time after ingestion |\n|-------|---------------------------------|\n| 50 % of the alcohol in the drink has entered the bloodstream | 15–30 min |\n| Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC) | 30–90 min (usually 45–60 min for a standard drink) |\n| 90 % of the alcohol has been absorbed | 90–120 min |\n\n**Rate of absorption**\n\n* Roughly **0.1 g of alcohol per minute** in a typical adult (about 14 g in a standard drink).  \n* The rate can be slower if the stomach is full, if the drink is very high‑proof, or if the person has a slower gastric emptying rate.\n\n**Factors that influence absorption**\n\n1. **Food** – A meal, especially one high in fat or protein, slows gastric emptying and reduces the rate of absorption.  \n2. **Alcohol concentration** – Very high‑proof drinks (e.g., spirits) are absorbed more quickly than beer or wine.  \n3. **Body weight & composition** – Larger or leaner individuals may absorb alcohol at slightly different rates.  \n4. **Gender** – Women generally absorb alcohol more quickly than men, partly due to lower body water content.  \n5. **Metabolism** – Genetic variations in alcohol‑dehydrogenase enzymes can affect how fast alcohol is metabolized, but this does not change the absorption phase.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nAlcohol is absorbed rapidly, with most of it entering the bloodstream within the first hour after drinking. The peak blood‑alcohol level is usually reached 30–90 minutes after consumption, depending on the factors above.",
