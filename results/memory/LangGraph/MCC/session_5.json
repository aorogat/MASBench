      "system_answer": "The Sun’s surface actually emits a broad, nearly “white” spectrum of light.  Its effective temperature is about 5,800 K, which corresponds to a yellow‑white hue in the visible range.  When that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, the shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering) more than the longer (red/yellow) wavelengths.  The result is that the light we see from the Sun is slightly shifted toward the yellow end of the spectrum, so the Sun appears yellow (or pale orange at sunrise/sunset).",

It is caused by an abnormal prion protein that accumulates in the brain, leading to spongy degeneration of brain tissue. Infected animals develop neurological symptoms such as loss of coordination, abnormal behavior, and eventually death. The disease can be transmitted to humans through consumption of infected beef products, causing a variant form of Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease, a rare and fatal brain disorder. Control measures include strict feed bans, surveillance, and culling of infected or at‑risk animals.",
