      "system_answer": "Here are a handful of crowd‑pleasing cocktails that are quick to make, easy to scale, and work well for a casual get‑together. Pick one (or a couple) that matches the vibe you’re going for—whether it’s a classic, a refreshing low‑ABV option, or something with a little extra flair.\n\n| Cocktail | Flavor Profile | Key Ingredients | Quick Prep Tips |\n|----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Classic Gin & Tonic** | Crisp, botanical, slightly bitter | Gin, tonic water, lime wedge | 1. Fill a highball glass with ice. 2. Add 2 oz gin. 3. Top with tonic. 4. Squeeze a lime wedge, drop in. 5. Stir gently. |\n| **Mojito** | Fresh, minty, citrusy | White rum, fresh mint, lime, simple syrup, club soda | 1. Muddle 6–8 mint leaves with 1 tsp sugar and 1 oz lime juice. 2. Add 2 oz rum and ice. 3. Top with club soda. 4. Stir, garnish with a mint sprig. |\n| **Classic Margarita** | Tangy, salty, bright | Tequila, Cointreau (or triple sec), lime juice, simple syrup | 1. Shake 2 oz tequila, 1 oz Cointreau, 1 oz lime juice, ½ oz simple syrup with ice. 2. Strain into a salt‑rimmed glass. 3. Garnish with a lime wheel. |\n| **Aperol Spritz** | Bitter‑sweet, bubbly | Aperol, Prosecco, club soda | 1. Fill a wine glass with ice. 2. Add 3 oz Prosecco, 2 oz Aperol, splash of soda. 3. Stir, garnish with an orange slice. |\n| **Cucumber‑Basil Gimlet** | Clean, herbaceous, slightly sweet | Gin, fresh cucumber, basil, lime, simple syrup | 1.

Enjoy the get‑together!",

      "question": "Current Date: 2023/05/25 (Thu) 15:08,\n\n Now Answer the Question: I was thinking of trying a new coffee creamer recipe. Any recommendations?",
      "system_answer": "Here are a few coffee‑creamer ideas that are quick to make, tasty, and can be tweaked to suit your taste or dietary needs. Pick one that matches the flavor profile you’re after, or mix and match elements from several to create your own signature blend.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Classic Vanilla‑Honey Creamer (Dairy or Non‑Dairy)\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Whole milk or oat milk | 2 cups | Oat milk gives a creamy, slightly sweet base. |\n| Honey | 2 Tbsp | Adjust to taste; use raw honey for richer flavor. |\n| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp | Pure vanilla for depth. |\n| Pinch of sea salt | 1/8 tsp | Balances sweetness. |\n| Optional: 1 Tbsp maple syrup |  | For extra natural sweetness. |\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Warm the milk in a small saucepan over low heat (do not boil).  \n2. Stir in honey, maple syrup (if using), vanilla, and salt until dissolved.  \n3. Let cool, then transfer to a clean jar or bottle.  \n4. Shake well before each use.  \n5. Store in the fridge for up to 1 week.\n\n**Why it works** – The honey and vanilla give a classic “sweet‑but‑not‑overpowering” flavor that pairs well with almost any coffee style.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Coconut‑Cinnamon Creamer (Low‑Sugar, Dairy‑Free)\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Coconut milk (canned, full‑fat) | 2 cups | Use the liquid, not the cream. |\n| Unsweetened shredded coconut | 1 Tbsp | Adds texture and coconut flavor. |\n| Ground cinnamon | 1 tsp | Warm spice note. |\n| Stevia or monk‑fruit sweetener | to taste | Use a liquid or powdered form. |\n| Pinch of nutmeg | 1/8 tsp | Optional, for depth. |\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Warm coconut milk gently in a saucepan.  \n2. Add shredded coconut, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sweetener.  \n3. Stir until the coconut is evenly distributed.  \n4. Cool, then pour into a jar.  \n5. Shake before each use.  \n6. Keep refrigerated; lasts about 5 days.\n\n**Why it works** – Coconut milk gives a naturally creamy texture, while cinnamon and nutmeg add a comforting spice that’s great for morning lattes.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Almond‑Mocha Creamer (Coffee‑Lover’s Delight)\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Unsweetened almond milk | 2 cups | Low‑calorie base. |\n| Cocoa powder (unsweetened) | 2 Tbsp | For chocolate flavor. |\n| Ground espresso or instant coffee | 1 Tbsp | Adds real coffee kick. |\n| Maple syrup or agave nectar | 1 Tbsp | Sweetens without dairy. |\n| Pinch of sea salt | 1/8 tsp | Enhances flavor. |\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Warm almond milk in a saucepan.  \n2. Whisk in cocoa powder, espresso, sweetener, and salt until smooth.  \n3. Let cool, then bottle.  \n4. Shake before use.  \n5. Store in the fridge for up to a week.\n\n**Why it works** – The espresso gives a subtle coffee flavor that complements the chocolate, making it a great “coffee‑in‑a‑cup” option.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Spiced‑Apple Creamer (Seasonal, Low‑Sugar)\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Unsweetened oat milk | 2 cups | Creamy, neutral base. |\n| Apple sauce (unsweetened) | 1/2 cup | Adds natural fruit sweetness. |\n| Ground cinnamon | 1 tsp | Classic spice. |\n| Ground ginger | 1/2 tsp | Adds warmth. |\n| Vanilla extract | 1/2 tsp | Depth. |\n| Pinch of salt | 1/8 tsp | Balances flavors. |\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Warm oat milk in a saucepan.  \n2. Stir in apple sauce, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, and salt.  \n3. Heat until everything is well combined (do not boil).  \n4. Cool, then transfer to a jar.  \n5. Shake before each use.  \n6. Refrigerate; lasts about 5 days.\n\n**Why it works** – The apple sauce gives a subtle fruitiness that pairs nicely with pumpkin‑spiced coffees or chai lattes.\n\n---\n\n## 5. “Zero‑Sugar” Creamer (For Keto or Low‑Carb)\n\n| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n| Heavy cream | 1 cup | Provides richness. |\n| Unsweetened almond milk | 1 cup | Lightens the mix. |\n| Stevia or erythritol | to taste | Use a liquid or powdered form. |\n| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp | Flavor. |\n| Pinch of sea salt | 1/8 tsp | Enhances taste. |\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Combine heavy cream and almond milk in a saucepan.  \n2. Warm gently, then add sweetener, vanilla, and salt.  \n3. Stir until dissolved.  \n4. Cool, bottle, and shake before use.  \n5. Store in the fridge for up to a week.\n\n**Why it works** – Heavy cream gives a luxurious mouthfeel, while the low‑carb sweetener keeps the sugar count minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Tips for Customizing Your Creamer\n\n| Tip | How to Apply |\n|-----|--------------|\n| **Adjust sweetness** | Add more or less honey, maple, or sweetener until you hit the right balance. |\n| **Add spices** | Try cardamom, clove, or allspice for a different flavor profile. |\n| **Use flavored extracts** | Almond, hazelnut, or coconut extracts can give a subtle twist. |\n| **Add a splash of espresso** | For a mocha‑style creamer, add a tablespoon of brewed espresso. |\n| **Make it thicker** | Add a tablespoon of chia seeds or ground flaxseed; let sit for 10 min to gel. |\n| **Keep it fresh** | Store in a tightly sealed jar; shake well before each use. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick One‑Pot “Instant” Creamer (No Fridge Needed)\n\nIf you’re short on time or don’t want to refrigerate, try this:\n\n1. **Ingredients** – 1 cup",

      "system_answer": "It really comes down to **how urgent your storage needs are** and whether you’re comfortable waiting for a potential price drop or new feature set.\n\n| Factor | Buy Now | Wait |\n|--------|---------|------|\n| **Immediate need** | If you’re already running out of space, have critical backups that need a reliable off‑site location, or want to start using the NAS for media streaming, a 2‑bay or 4‑bay unit today will solve those problems right away. | If you can keep using your external drives or cloud backup for a few more weeks, you can hold off. |\n| **Price trends** | NAS prices are fairly stable; a 2‑bay unit is usually $150‑$200, a 4‑bay $300‑$400. You’ll likely pay the same price now or in a month. | Newer models (e.g., Synology DS218+ or QNAP TS‑231P‑Pro) are slated for release in the next 3‑6 months. They may come with better CPU, more RAM, or newer firmware, but the price difference is usually modest. |\n| **Feature set** | Current 2‑bay models already support SSD caching, RAID‑1/0, cloud sync, and mobile apps. If you don’t need advanced virtualization or 10‑GbE networking, a current model is fine. | If you’re interested in future‑proofing (e.g., 10‑GbE, NVMe SSDs, or a larger 8‑bay chassis), waiting could give you a better starting point. |\n| **Availability** | Stock is usually plentiful for the mainstream 2‑bay and 4‑bay units. If you’re in a hurry, you can order today and have it in 1–2 weeks. | Some newer models may have longer lead times or limited initial stock, so waiting could mean a longer wait once they’re released. |\n| **Budget** | You can lock in today’s price and avoid any price hikes that might happen if the market shifts (e.g., supply chain issues). | If you’re price‑sensitive, you might catch a holiday sale or a bundle deal in the next few months. |\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Buy now** if you’re already stretched for space, need a reliable backup solution, or want to start using the NAS for media or file sharing today. The price is stable, and you’ll get a fully functional system in a few days.\n- **Wait** if you can comfortably keep using your current storage for a little longer, or if you’re specifically looking for the newest hardware (e.g., a 10‑GbE chassis or a model with NVMe support). In that case, a few months’ wait is unlikely to cost you much more, and you’ll get a slightly more future‑proof unit.\n\nGiven that NAS prices haven’t been dropping dramatically and the urgency of your storage needs is the biggest factor, I’d lean toward **buying now** unless you’re certain you can postpone the upgrade for a few weeks without risk.",
      "gold_answer": "The user would prefer responses that take into account their current home network storage capacity issues and recent reliance on external hard drives, highlighting the potential benefits of a NAS device in addressing these specific needs. They might not prefer responses that ignore their current storage challenges or fail to consider their recent tech upgrades and priorities.

If you’re uncertain or feel that the potential downsides outweigh the benefits, it’s perfectly fine to skip or opt for a smaller, more manageable gathering.

      "system_answer": "It’s a pretty common observation—and there are a few solid reasons why your bike (and you) can feel “lighter” or more responsive during a Sunday group ride:\n\n| Factor | Why it helps | Practical tip |\n|--------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Drafting** | Riding in a pack cuts the wind resistance by 20‑30 % (or more, depending on spacing). The bike doesn’t have to work as hard to maintain the same speed, so it feels smoother and less tiring. | Keep a safe but close distance to the rider in front—usually 1–2 m for road bikes, a bit more on gravel. |\n| **Consistent pacing** | Group rides often have a steady tempo set by the leader or the group’s average. You’re less likely to “spike” your effort or coast, which keeps the drivetrain in a more efficient gear range. | Pay attention to the group’s cadence and try to match it; this keeps the chain in a good gear and reduces unnecessary shifting. |\n| **Mental boost** | Riding with others removes the mental load of route‑finding, traffic monitoring, and solo decision‑making. You can focus on pedaling technique and bike feel. | Use the group as a cue: if you feel a drop in cadence, check the rider ahead for a gear change or a slight speed bump. |\n| **Better warm‑up** | By the time you hit the group, you’ve already done a short warm‑up (e.g., a few laps around the parking lot). Your muscles and drivetrain are already primed. | Do a 5‑minute easy spin before the group starts, then let the group’s rhythm finish the warm‑up. |\n| **Route familiarity** | Group rides often use well‑known, bike‑friendly routes with fewer traffic intersections and smoother pavement. | Stick to the same loop or corridor each week; the bike’s tires and brakes will “learn” the surface. |\n| **Reduced stress** | No need to worry about traffic lights, pedestrians, or solo navigation. Less mental stress translates to less muscle tension. | Keep your shoulders relaxed and let the group’s rhythm guide",
