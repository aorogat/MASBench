Pick the park(s) that fit your vibe and you’ll have a solid plan in hand.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Pick Your Park(s)\n\n| Park | Why it’s a great weekend choice | Current/Upcoming Events (August‑Sept) |\n|------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Disneyland (Anaheim)** | Classic rides + new “Disneyland Resort” FastPass+ system. | *Summer Nights* fireworks & “Fantasmic!” show (daily).  |\n| **Universal Studios Hollywood** | Harry Potter world + thrilling rides + live shows. | *Nighttime Lights* (Halloween‑style lights) – 8 pm nightly. |\n| **Six Flags Magic Mountain** | Highest‑capacity coaster lineup in the U.S. | *Summer Sizzler* (special music & food stalls). |\n| **Knott’s Berry Farm** | Great for a single‑day “full‑day” experience. | *Knott’s Summer Bash* (live music, food trucks). |\n\n> **Tip:** If you’re already familiar with all four, a two‑park weekend (e.g., Disneyland + Universal) gives you variety without over‑packing your schedule.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sample 2‑Day Itinerary\n\n| Time | Day 1 | Day 2 |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| **8:00 am** | Arrive early, grab a **FastPass+** (Disney) or **Express Pass** (Universal). | Arrive early, use the **Universal Express** if you have it. |\n| **9:00 am** | Ride **Space Mountain** (no‑lines). | Ride **The Incredible Hulk Coaster** (short wait). |\n| **10:30 am** | **Mickey’s Diner** for a classic breakfast sandwich. | **The Three Broomsticks** for a hearty lunch. |\n| **12:00 pm** | **Indiana Jones Adventure** (FastPass). | **Jurassic Park River Adventure** (water‑cooling). |\n| **2:00 pm** | **Haunted Mansion** (short wait). | **The Wizarding World of Harry Potter** – “Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.” |\n| **4:00 pm** | **Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge** – try the **Blue Milk**. | **Nighttime Lights** show (8 pm). |\n| **6:00 pm** | **Fantasmic!** (Disney) or **Disneyland’s “Nighttime Spectacular”**. | **Universal’s “Nighttime Lights”** (8 pm). |\n| **8:00 pm** | Grab a **Dole Whip** or **Mickey‑shaped ice cream**. | Finish with a **“Wizarding World”** dessert (e.g., “Pumpkin Pasties”). |\n\n> **Pro‑tip:** Download the park’s mobile app to see real‑time wait times, show schedules, and to order food ahead of time.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Must‑Try Food & Drinks\n\n| Park | Signature Snack | Why It’s Worth It |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Disneyland | **Mickey‑shaped ice cream** | Iconic, photogenic, and melts fast. |\n| Universal | **The Three Broomsticks** “Pumpkin Pasties” | Seasonal, warm, and a crowd‑pleaser. |\n| Six Flags | **“Sizzler” BBQ sliders** | Hearty, portable, and a local favorite. |\n| Knott’s | **Fruity Pebbles** (the original) | Nostalgic, sweet, and a great energy boost. |\n\n> **Snack hack:** Pack a small reusable water bottle and a few energy bars (e.g., RXBAR, Clif) to keep you fueled between rides.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
