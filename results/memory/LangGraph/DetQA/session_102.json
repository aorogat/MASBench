The hostess knew that Philipa was the niece of the wealthy man and felt better giving her a portion of the inheritance she had claimed fraudulently.\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, Felicia (referred to as Philipa in the clues) is revealed to be the niece of the wealthy patriarch. The mistress, aware of Felicia’s claim to the inheritance and the potential for a legal dispute, decided to give her a portion as a form of appeasement and to pre‑empt any challenge. This act also serves to keep Felicia quiet and prevent her from pursuing a full claim, thereby protecting the mistress’s own interests.
