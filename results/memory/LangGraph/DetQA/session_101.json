Mrs. Hemm\nB. Mr. and Mrs. MacNamara\nC. The Brandt couple\nD. Miss House\n Output:",
      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. The Brandt couple\",\"reasoning\":\"The Brandt couple (Mr. and Mrs. Brandt) are the neighbors of 19 Wilbraham Crescent and are directly implicated in the investigation.  They were interviewed by Poirot, were present at the scene, and their statements and actions are tied to the circumstances of the victim’s death.  In contrast, Mrs. Hemm and the MacNamara couple are only peripheral witnesses, and “Miss House” is not a character referenced in the narrative.  Therefore the Brandt couple are the characters most closely related to the deceased’s death.\"}",
