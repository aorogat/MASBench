      "question": "i need a recipe for chicken cordon bleu",
      "system_answer": [
        "Here’s a classic, crowd‑pleasing recipe for **Chicken Cordon Bleu**. It’s a bit of a prep‑heavy dish, but the result is a tender chicken breast stuffed with ham and Swiss cheese, coated in a crispy breadcrumb crust, and finished in a creamy sauce.  \n\n---\n\n## Ingredients  \n\n| Quantity | Item |\n|----------|------|\n| 4 | Boneless, skin‑less chicken breasts (about 6–8 oz each) |\n| 4 | Thin slices of cooked ham (or smoked ham) |\n| 4 | Swiss cheese slices (or Gruyère, Emmental, or a mix) |\n| 1 cup | All‑purpose flour (for dredging) |\n| 2 | Large eggs, beaten |\n| 1 cup | Panko breadcrumbs (or regular breadcrumbs) |\n| ½ cup | Grated Parmesan cheese |\n| 2 Tbsp | Unsalted butter |\n| 2 Tbsp | Olive oil |\n| 1 cup | Chicken broth (low‑sodium) |\n| ½ cup | Heavy cream (or half‑and‑half) |\n| 1 Tbsp | Dijon mustard |\n| 1 tsp | Worcestershire sauce |\n| ½ tsp | Garlic powder |\n| ½ tsp | Onion powder |\n| ¼ tsp | Black pepper |\n| ¼ tsp | Salt (adjust to taste) |\n| Fresh parsley, chopped | For garnish (optional) |\n\n---\n\n## Equipment  \n\n- Meat mallet or rolling pin  \n- Sharp knife  \n- Cutting board  \n- 2 shallow bowls (for flour, eggs, breadcrumb mix)  \n- Skillet (heavy‑bottomed, preferably cast iron or stainless steel)  \n- Oven‑proof dish (optional, for finishing in the oven)  \n\n---\n\n## Instructions  \n\n### 1. Prepare the chicken  \n1. **Flatten the breasts**: Place each breast between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound to an even thickness of about ½ in (1.3 cm).  \n2. **Season**: Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides.\n\n### 2. Assemble the roulades  \n1. **Layer**: On each flattened breast, lay one slice of ham and one slice of cheese.  \n2. **Roll**: Carefully roll the breast tightly, securing the ends with a toothpick or kitchen twine if needed.  \n3. **Set aside**: Keep the rolled breasts on a plate while you prepare the coating.\n\n### 3. Make the coating  \n1. **Flour**: Place the flour in a shallow bowl.  \n2. **Egg wash**: Beat the eggs in a second bowl.  \n3. **Breadcrumb mix**: In a third bowl, combine panko, grated Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.\n\n### 4. Coat the roulades  \n1. **Dredge**: Roll each rolled breast in flour, shaking off excess.  \n2. **Egg**: Dip in the beaten eggs, letting excess drip off.  \n3. **Breadcrumb**: Coat with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing lightly to adhere.  \n4. **Repeat**: For extra crunch, you can double‑coat (flour → egg → breadcrumbs → egg → breadcrumbs).\n\n### 5. Sear the chicken  \n1. **Heat**: In a large skillet, melt 1 Tbsp butter and add 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium‑high heat.  \n2. **Cook**: Place the coated roulades in the skillet. Sear for 2–3 min per side, until golden brown.  \n3. **Transfer**: If you prefer a fully cooked interior, you can finish the chicken in a preheated oven at 375 °F (190 °C) for 10–12 min, or simply reduce the heat to medium and cover for a few minutes to allow the inside to cook through.\n\n### 6. Make the sauce (optional but recommended)  \n1. **Deglaze**: Remove the chicken and set aside. In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 Tbsp butter.  \n2. **Add broth**: Pour in the chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits.  \n3. **Simmer**: Let it reduce by about half (≈2 min).  \n4. **Cream**: Stir in the heavy cream, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and a pinch of salt.  \n5. **Thicken**: Cook for another 1–2 min until the sauce is slightly thickened.  \n6. **Return chicken**: Place the chicken back into the skillet, spooning sauce over it. Warm through for 1–2 min.\n\n### 7. Serve  \n1. **Plate**: Remove toothpicks or twine. Slice the roulades into ½‑inch thick rounds if desired.  \n2. **Garnish**: Sprinkle chopped parsley over the top.  \n3. **Accompaniments**: Classic pairings include mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, or a simple green salad.\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Variations  \n\n- **Cheese swap**: Gruyère or Emmental give a richer flavor; mozzarella works if you prefer a milder taste.  \n- **Breadcrumbs**: Panko gives a crispier crust; regular breadcrumbs are fine too.  \n- **Sauce**: A simple white wine reduction or a mustard‑cream sauce works beautifully.  \n- **Cooking method**: If you’re short on time, you can bake the coated roulades at 400 °F (200 °C) for 20–25 min, then finish with the sauce.  \n- **Make‑ahead**: Assemble the roulades a day ahead, refrigerate, and cook just before serving.  \n\nEnjoy your homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu! If you have any questions about the steps or substitutions, just let me know."

He didn’t discover its psychedelic properties until 1943, when he accidentally absorbed a small amount through his fingertips and experienced a vivid, mind‑bending trip. This serendipitous “accidental discovery” is often cited as one of the most famous examples of a scientific breakthrough happening by pure chance!"

      "system_answer": [
        "Rice is a staple food for more than half the world’s population, and for most people it can be a healthy part of a balanced diet—especially when you choose the right type and watch portion sizes. Here’s a quick rundown of the pros, cons, and tips for making rice work for you:\n\n| **Aspect** | **What to Know** |\n|------------|------------------|\n| **Nutritional profile** | • **White rice**: 1 cup cooked ≈ 205 kcal, 4 g protein, 0.4 g fat, 45 g carbs, 0.6 g fiber. <br>• **Brown rice**: 1 cup cooked ≈ 215 kcal, 5 g protein, 1.8 g fat, 45 g carbs, 3.5 g fiber. <br>• **Wild rice**: 1 cup cooked ≈ 166 kcal, 6 g protein, 1 g fat, 35 g carbs, 3.8 g fiber. |\n| **Micronutrients** | Brown rice and wild rice contain more B‑vitamins (thiamin, niacin, B6), magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium. White rice is often enriched with folic acid and iron. |\n| **Glycemic Index (GI)** | • White rice: GI 70–90 (high). <br>• Brown rice: GI 50–55 (moderate). <br>• Wild rice: GI 45–50 (low). <br>High‑GI foods can spike blood sugar, so pairing rice with protein, fiber, or healthy fats can help blunt the rise. |\n| **Health benefits** | • **Energy**: Carbohydrates are the body’s primary fuel source. <br>• **Satiety**: Whole‑grain varieties (brown, wild) provide more fiber, which can help you feel fuller longer. <br>• **Heart‑healthy**: Whole grains are linked to lower LDL cholesterol and reduced risk of heart disease. |\n| **Potential downsides** | • **Calorie density**: Rice is calorie‑dense; large portions can contribute to weight gain if not balanced. <br>• **Arsenic**: Some rice (especially jasmine, basmati, and rice grown in certain regions) can contain higher levels of inorganic arsenic. Rinsing, cooking with excess water, and choosing lower‑arsenic varieties (e.g., short‑grain, parboiled) can reduce exposure. |\n| **Practical tips** | 1. **Choose whole grains**: Brown, wild, or parboiled rice for more fiber and nutrients. <br>2. **Watch portions**: A typical serving is about ½ cup cooked (≈90 kcal). <br>3. **Pair wisely**: Add veggies, lean protein, or a splash of healthy oil to balance the meal. <br>4. **Cook smart**: Rinse rice thoroughly, use a 2:1 water‑to‑rice ratio, and let it rest after cooking to avoid over‑cooking. <br>5. **Diversify**: Mix in quinoa, barley, or millet for variety and extra nutrients. |\n| **When to avoid or limit** | • **Diabetes or blood‑sugar concerns**: Opt for low‑GI whole grains and keep portions moderate. <br>• **Calorie‑restricted diets**: Use rice sparingly or replace with cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, or other low‑carb alternatives. |\n\n### Bottom line\nRice can be a healthy, energy‑providing food—especially if you lean toward whole‑grain varieties, keep portions in check, and pair it with protein, fiber, and healthy fats. If you have specific health concerns (e.g., diabetes, weight management, or arsenic exposure), tweak the type, portion, or cooking method accordingly. Enjoy it as part of a varied, balanced diet!"

        "Here are the most effective, practical ways to keep your credit score from slipping:\n\n| # | What to Do | Why It Helps | Quick Tips |\n|---|------------|--------------|------------|\n| 1 | **Pay every bill on time** | Payment history is the single biggest factor (≈35 % of your score). Even one late payment can drop 50‑100 points. | • Set up automatic payments or calendar reminders.<br>• If you’re close to a due date, pay early. |\n| 2 | **Keep credit‑card balances low** | Utilization (balance ÷ credit limit) should stay below 30 %—ideally under 10 % for the best impact. | • Pay balances in full each month.<br>• If you can’t, pay at least 30 % of the balance. |\n| 3 | **Avoid opening many new accounts at once** | Each hard inquiry can dip your score a few points, and opening several new lines can lower your average account age. | • Apply for new credit only when you really need it.<br>• Space out applications by at least 6–12 months. |\n| 4 | **Check your credit reports regularly** | Errors (wrong balances, late payments, accounts you don’t own) can drag your score down. | • Get free reports from AnnualCreditReport.com (once a year, or use free services like Credit Karma).<br>• Dispute any inaccuracies promptly. |\n| 5 | **Keep old accounts open** | Length of credit history matters (≈15 % of your score). | • Even if you don’t use a card, keep it active—just don’t let it accrue fees. |\n| 6 | **Use a mix of credit types wisely** | A healthy mix (credit cards, installment loans, etc.) can boost your score, but only if you manage them well. | • Don’t take out a loan you don’t need just to “add variety.” |\n| 7 | **Avoid large, sudden balance spikes** | A sudden jump in utilization can hurt your score even if you pay it off later. | • If you need a big purchase, consider a short‑term loan or a balance‑transfer card with a 0 % intro APR. |\n| 8 | **Set up alerts** | Many banks let you receive text or email alerts for low balances, upcoming due dates, or suspicious activity. | • Use alerts to catch potential fraud early and stay on top of payments. |\n| 9 | **Use credit‑monitoring services (optional)** | Some services flag changes to your score or report suspicious activity. | • Free options: Credit Karma, Credit Sesame. <br>• Paid options: Experian, TransUnion, Equifax. |\n| 10 | **Stay informed about changes to credit‑reporting rules** | Laws and scoring models evolve; knowing the basics helps you anticipate impacts. | • Read updates from the CFPB or major credit‑reporting agencies. |\n\n### Quick “Score‑Guard Checklist” (Daily/Monthly)\n\n| Frequency | Action | Tool |\n|-----------|--------|------|\n| Daily | Check account balances | Mobile banking app |\n| Weekly | Review recent transactions | Bank statement or app |\n| Monthly | Pay all bills before due date | Auto‑pay or calendar reminder |\n| Quarterly | Review credit‑report summary | Credit Karma, Credit Sesame |\n| Annually | Order free credit reports | AnnualCreditReport.com |\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Consistency** is key: regular, on‑time payments and low balances are the most reliable protectors of your score.\n- **Awareness**: keep an eye on your reports and dispute errors quickly.\n- **Moderation**: avoid unnecessary new credit and keep older accounts open.\n\nFollow these steps, and you’ll be well‑positioned to keep your credit score steady—or even improve it over time."

      "system_answer": [
        "### Bad Habits & How to Overcome Them  \nBelow is a quick guide that covers common “bad habits” people struggle with, why they’re hard to break, and practical, evidence‑based strategies to replace them with healthier behaviors.\n\n| # | Habit | Why It’s Problematic | Quick Fixes / Replacement | Tips for Success |\n|---|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 | **Procrastination** | Delays important tasks → stress, missed deadlines. | • **Pomodoro**: 25 min focused work + 5 min break.<br>• **Two‑minute rule**: If it takes <2 min, do it now. | • Set a timer; treat it like a game.<br>• Reward yourself after each session. |\n| 2 | **Excessive screen time** (especially before bed) | Disrupts sleep, reduces productivity. | • **Screen‑free hour** before bed.<br>• Use blue‑light filter apps. | • Keep phone out of bedroom.<br>• Replace scrolling with a book or journal. |\n| 3 | **Skipping meals / irregular eating** | Low energy, overeating later. | • Plan 3 balanced meals + 1–2 snacks.<br>• Prep meals in advance. | • Use a meal‑planning app or calendar reminder. |\n| 4 | **Smoking / vaping** | Health risks, addiction. | • Nicotine replacement (patch, gum).<br>• Seek support groups or counseling. | • Set a quit date; track progress in a journal. |\n| 5 | **Over‑consumption of sugary drinks** | Weight gain, blood‑sugar spikes. | • Replace soda with sparkling water + lemon.<br>• Keep a water bottle handy. | • Track daily intake; aim for gradual reduction. |\n| 6 | **Negative self‑talk / rumination** | Low mood, anxiety. | • Practice **cognitive reframing**: challenge negative thoughts.<br>• Use a gratitude journal. | • Set a “worry time” (e.g., 15 min) to limit rumination. |\n| 7 | **Skipping exercise** | Decreased fitness, mood. | • Start with 10‑minute walks; gradually increase. <br>• Join a class or find a workout buddy. | • Schedule workouts like appointments. |\n| 8 | **Impulse buying** | Debt, clutter. | • 24‑hour rule: wait before purchasing non‑essentials.<br>• Keep a shopping list. | • Track spending in a budgeting app. |\n| 9 | **Multitasking** | Lower quality work, higher stress. | • Focus on one task at a time; use a task list. | • Use “focus mode” on your phone/computer. |\n|10 | **Poor sleep hygiene** | Fatigue, impaired cognition. | • Consistent bedtime & wake‑up time.<br>• Create a calming pre‑sleep routine. | • Keep bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. |\n\n---\n\n## Step‑by‑Step Plan to Break a Habit\n\n1. **Identify the Trigger**  \n   *What prompts the habit?*  \n   Example: “I reach for a sugary drink when I’m bored at work.”\n\n2. **Choose a Replacement Behavior**  \n   *Pick a healthier action that satisfies the same need.*  \n   Example: “I’ll take a short walk or sip water instead.”\n\n3. **Set a Clear, Measurable Goal**  \n   *Instead of “stop smoking,” try “reduce to 10 cigarettes/day for 2 weeks.”*\n\n4. **Use Implementation Intentions**  \n   *Plan the “when‑then” scenario.*  \n   Example: “When I feel the urge to smoke, then I will chew gum for 5 min.”\n\n5. **Track Progress**  \n   *Keep a simple log or use a habit‑tracking app.*  \n   Celebrate small wins (e.g., “I avoided soda for 3 days”).\n\n6. **Build Support**  \n   *Tell a friend or join a group.*  \n   Accountability partners can boost motivation.\n\n7. **Reward Yourself**  \n   *Positive reinforcement helps cement new habits.*  \n   Example: “After a week of no junk food, I’ll treat myself to a movie.”\n\n8. **Be Patient & Persistent**  \n   *Habits take time (often 21–66 days).*  \n   If you slip, analyze what triggered it and adjust your plan.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Resources\n\n| Resource | What It Offers |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Habit‑tracking apps** (Habitica, Streaks, Loop) | Visual progress, reminders |\n| **Mindfulness apps** (Headspace, Insight Timer) | Reduce impulse & rumination |\n| **Nutrition trackers** (MyFitnessPal, Yazio) | Monitor food habits |\n| **Sleep apps** (Sleep Cycle, Pillow) | Improve sleep hygiene |\n| **Support groups** (Quitline, SMART Recovery) | Peer support for quitting smoking, alcohol, etc. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\nBreaking a bad habit isn’t about willpower alone—it’s about creating a system that makes the healthy choice the easiest and most rewarding. Pick one habit to tackle first, apply the steps above, and celebrate each small victory. Over time, those changes will compound into lasting, positive behavior. Good luck—you’ve got this!"

The most common method to estimate MHR is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MHR} \\approx 220 - \\text{age}\n\\]\n\nTarget heart‑rate zones are then set as a percentage of that MHR:\n\n| Zone | % of MHR | Typical purpose |\n|------|----------|-----------------|\n| **Very light** | 50–60 % | Warm‑up, recovery |\n| **Light** | 60–70 % | Fat burning, general fitness |\n| **Moderate** | 70–80 % | Aerobic conditioning, endurance |\n| **Hard** | 80–90 % | Improving VO₂ max, high‑intensity training |\n| **Maximum** | 90–100 % | Sprinting, very short bursts |\n\nDuring exercise you monitor your heart rate (via a watch, chest strap, or pulse) and try to stay within the desired zone. This helps ensure you’re exercising at the right intensity for your goals while avoiding over‑ or under‑training."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Why the Sun Looks Yellow**\n\n| Why it’s *yellow* | What’s really happening |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | The Sun actually emits almost *white* light (a mix of all visible wavelengths). As that light travels through Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue and violet photons are scattered by air molecules and dust. The longer‑wavelength yellow‑orange photons reach our eyes more directly, so the Sun appears yellow. |\n| **Human eye sensitivity** | Our eyes are most sensitive to green‑yellow light. When the Sun is high in the sky, the scattered blue light is reduced, so the yellow‑green part dominates our perception. |\n| **Altitude effect** | At sunrise or sunset the Sun’s light passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and leaving a reddish‑orange hue. When the Sun is overhead, the path is shorter, less scattering, and the color is closer to white‑yellow. |\n| **Instrumental & cultural factors** | Many photographs and artistic depictions use a slightly yellow tint to emphasize warmth or to match the color of the Sun’s surface (the photosphere is about 5,800 K, which appears white‑yellow to the human eye). |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Sun itself is essentially white; it looks yellow to us because the Earth’s atmosphere preferentially scatters away the blue part of its spectrum, leaving the yellow‑orange wavelengths to dominate our view."

There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT‑1, SAT‑2, SAT‑3, and Asia‑1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (up to 41 °C) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) on the tongue, inside the mouth, and on the teats (in cattle) <br>• Swelling of the feet and hooves (hence the name) <br>• Lameness, difficulty chewing, and reduced milk production. <br>• In young animals, the disease can be severe and may lead to death. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from decreased milk and meat production, trade restrictions, culling of infected animals, and costs of vaccination and biosecurity. Because of its high contagion, many countries impose strict quarantine and movement controls. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Vaccination (live or inactivated) is the main tool in endemic regions. <br>• Strict movement controls, quarantine, and culling of infected or exposed animals. <br>• Biosecurity measures: disinfectants, controlled access to farms, and proper disposal of carcasses. |\n| **Human health** | FMD is **not** transmissible to humans. Humans can become infected only by handling infected animals or contaminated products, but the virus does not cause disease in people. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the mouths and feet of livestock, leading to significant economic losses in the agriculture sector."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation and Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound, then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal, sonar can determine distance, size, shape, and sometimes material properties of the target.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Principle** | Sound travels through a medium (water, air, etc.). When it encounters an object, part of the wave reflects back. The sonar system sends a “ping” and records the echo. |\n| **Types** | • **Active sonar** – emits a pulse and listens for echoes (used for navigation, mapping, and object detection). <br>• **Passive sonar** – only listens for sounds produced by other objects (used for detecting ships, submarines, marine life). |\n| **Applications** | • **Naval** – submarine detection, mine detection, navigation. <br>• **Commercial** – fishing (to locate fish schools), underwater mapping, pipeline inspection. <br>• **Scientific** – oceanography, marine biology, seafloor mapping. |\n| **Key parameters** | • **Frequency** – higher frequencies give finer resolution but attenuate faster; lower frequencies travel farther but with less detail. <br>• **Range** – distance the sonar can effectively detect objects. <br>• **Beamwidth** – the angular spread of the transmitted sound; narrower beams give better directionality. |\n| **How it works** | 1. **Transmit**: A transducer emits a sound pulse. <br>2. **Propagation**: The pulse travels through water. <br>3. **Reflection**: It hits an object and reflects back. <br>4. **Receive**: The transducer (now acting as a receiver) picks up the echo. <br>5. **Processing**: The system calculates distance (time delay × speed of sound) and may analyze echo characteristics for identification. |\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where sight is limited."

It’s often described as a constant dull ache or “deep” pain. |\n| **Tender points** | 18 specific spots on the body (e.g., neck, shoulders, elbows, hips) that are especially sensitive to pressure. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. |\n| **Sleep problems** | Trouble falling or staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. |\n| **Cognitive issues** | Often called “fibro fog” – difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, and feeling mentally sluggish. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, depression or anxiety, numbness/tingling, and sometimes sensitivity to temperature or sound. |\n\n---\n\n### Causes & Risk Factors\n\n- **Exact cause unknown** – It’s thought to involve a combination of genetics, stress, infections, and abnormal pain processing in the brain and spinal cord.\n- **Risk factors**:  \n  - Women (especially 30‑50 yr old) are more often affected.  \n  - Family history of fibromyalgia or other chronic pain conditions.  \n  - History of physical or emotional trauma.  \n  - Certain infections (e.g., Lyme disease, mononucleosis).  \n\n---\n\n### Diagnosis\n\n- **Clinical evaluation** – A doctor will look for the tender points and ask about pain patterns, sleep, and fatigue.  \n- **Exclusion** – Other conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease) are ruled out with blood tests or imaging.  \n- **Criteria** – The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses a set of criteria that combine pain severity, tender point count, and symptom duration.\n\n---\n\n### Treatment\n\nThere’s no single cure, but a combination of approaches can help:\n\n| Approach | What it does |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Medications** | Pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs), antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin). |\n| **Exercise** | Low‑impact activities (walking, swimming, yoga) improve pain and sleep. |\n| **Physical therapy** | Strengthening and stretching to reduce stiffness. |\n| **Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (CBT)** | Helps manage pain perception and coping strategies. |\n| **Sleep hygiene** | Consistent bedtime routine, limiting caffeine/alcohol, and creating a dark, cool sleep environment. |\n| **Stress management** | Mindfulness, relaxation techniques, or biofeedback. |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Balanced diet, adequate hydration, and avoiding over‑exertion. |\n\n---\n\n### Living with Fibromyalgia\n\n- **Track symptoms** – A pain diary can help identify triggers (certain foods, stress, weather changes).  \n- **Set realistic goals** – Small, achievable steps in exercise or daily tasks reduce frustration.  \n- **Seek support** – Support groups, counseling, or online communities can provide emotional help.  \n- **Regular check‑ins** – Work with a rheumatologist or primary care provider to adjust treatment as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic, multi‑symptom condition that primarily causes widespread pain and fatigue. While the exact cause isn’t fully understood, a combination of medication, exercise, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. If you suspect you have fibromyalgia, a visit to a healthcare professional—ideally a rheumatologist—can start the diagnostic and treatment process."

The basic ingredients and process are:\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical materials |\n|------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **1. Feedstock** | Raw materials (usually petroleum‑derived hydrocarbons or natural biopolymers) are processed into monomers. | Ethylene, propylene, styrene, acrylonitrile, etc. |\n| **2. Polymerization** | Monomers link together through chemical reactions (addition or condensation) to form long chains. | Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), etc. |\n| **3. Additives** | Various chemicals are mixed in to give the plastic desired properties (color, flexibility, flame resistance, etc.). | Plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, impact modifiers, fillers. |\n| **4. Shaping** | The polymer melt or powder is molded, extruded, or cast into the final product. | Injection molding, blow molding, extrusion, thermoforming. |\n\n### Key points\n\n- **Synthetic vs. natural**  \n  - *Synthetic plastics* (most common) come from fossil‑fuel‑derived monomers.  \n  - *Bioplastics* can be made from renewable sources (corn‑starch, sugarcane, algae) and may be biodegradable.\n\n- **Common polymer families**  \n  - **Polyolefins** (PE, PP) – flexible, low‑cost, used in bags, containers.  \n  - **Polyesters** (PET, PET‑G) – strong, used in bottles, fibers.  \n  - **Polyvinyls** (PVC, PVDF) – rigid or flexible, used in pipes, cables.  \n  - **Polymethyl methacrylate** (PMMA) – clear, glass‑like, used in lenses, displays.  \n  - **Polysulfones, polycarbonates** – high‑temperature, high‑strength applications.\n\n- **Why plastics are so versatile**  \n  - By changing the monomer chemistry, the polymer’s density, melting point, toughness, transparency, and chemical resistance can be tuned.  \n  - Additives further customize properties for specific uses (e.g., UV stabilizers for outdoor use, flame retardants for electronics).\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPlastic is essentially a long chain of repeating molecular units (polymers) derived from monomers that are processed, mixed with additives, and shaped into the wide variety of products we use every day."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Legally blind** is a medical‑legal designation used to determine eligibility for disability benefits, vision‑related services, and certain accommodations.  The exact criteria vary by country, but the most widely cited standard is the U.S. definition used by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA).\n\n---\n\n## U.S. (HHS / SSA) Definition\n\n| Criterion | Threshold | What it means |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | 20/200 or worse in the better‑seeing eye **with best correction** (glasses or contact lenses) | 20/200 means what a person with normal vision can see at 200 ft, you would need to be at 20 ft to see the same detail. |\n| **Visual field** | 20 degrees or less (i.e., a “tunnel vision” of 20° or less) in the better‑seeing eye **with best correction** | A normal visual field is about 60–70° from the center to each side. |\n| **Both criteria** | Either one of the above is sufficient | If you meet either the acuity or the field criterion, you are considered legally blind. |\n\n**Key points**\n\n- The test is performed in the *better‑seeing* eye, not the worse eye.  \n- “Best correction” means the person must wear their optimal glasses or contacts during the test.  \n- The definition is used for:\n  - Eligibility for the **Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)** and **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**.\n  - Access to **vision‑related services** (e.g., low‑vision aids, orientation & mobility training).\n  - Certain **tax deductions** and **employment accommodations**.\n\n---\n\n## Other Common Standards\n\n| Country | Criterion | Notes |\n|---------|-----------|-------|\n| **Canada** | Visual acuity ≤ 20/200 in the better eye *or* visual field ≤ 20° | Similar to U.S. but may use the 20/200 threshold in the better eye without specifying correction. |\n| **United Kingdom** | Visual acuity ≤ 6/60 (≈ 20/200) in the better eye *or* visual field ≤ 20° | Uses metric notation (6/60). |\n| **Australia** | Visual acuity ≤ 6/60 in the better eye *or* visual field ≤ 20° | Same as UK. |\n| **International (WHO)** | Visual acuity ≤ 20/200 in the better eye *or* visual field ≤ 20° | WHO uses the same thresholds but does not specify correction. |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Take‑Away\n\n- **Legally blind** does **not** mean “completely blind.” Many people who are legally blind can still see shapes, colors, and some detail.\n- The designation is a *legal* status, not a medical diagnosis. It is used to determine eligibility for benefits and services.\n- If you think you might meet the criteria, you can have a vision test performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. The results can be used to apply for disability benefits or to request accommodations.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nIn the U.S., a person is considered legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity in the better eye is 20/200 or worse, or their visual field is 20 degrees or less. The same thresholds (20/200 acuity or 20° field) are used in most other countries, sometimes expressed in metric units."

      "system_answer": [
        "A **prism** is a transparent optical element—usually made of glass or plastic—whose flat, polished surfaces refract (bend) light.  \n\n### Key features\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Shape** | Most common is a triangular prism (two triangular faces and three rectangular faces). The cross‑section is a triangle, but any polyhedron with two parallel faces (a “prism” in geometry) can be called a prism. |\n| **Material** | Typically glass (e.g., crown or flint glass) or high‑index plastic. |\n| **Refractive index** | Determines how much the light bends; higher‑index materials bend light more. |\n| **Surface quality** | Must be optically flat and polished to avoid scattering. |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Refraction** – When light enters a prism, it slows down and bends because the speed of light is lower in the prism material than in air.  \n2. **Dispersion** – Different wavelengths (colors) of light have slightly different refractive indices, so they bend by different amounts.  \n3. **Exit** – The light leaves the prism on the other side, often emerging at a different angle and, if the prism is a triangular shape, split into a spectrum.\n\n### Common uses\n\n| Use | Why a prism is handy |\n|-----|---------------------|\n| **Spectroscopy** | A prism disperses white light into its component colors, allowing measurement of wavelengths. |\n| **Beam steering** | In lasers or optical instruments, a prism can redirect a beam without moving mirrors. |\n| **Color separation** | In photography or art, prisms can separate colors for creative effects. |\n| **Optical instruments** | Telescopes, binoculars, and microscopes use prisms for image inversion or to fold optical paths. |\n\n### Quick example\n\nA classic demonstration: shine a flashlight through a triangular glass prism. The beam splits into a rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet—showing the prism’s ability to disperse light.\n\nIn short, a prism is a flat‑sided, transparent piece of material that bends and splits light, making it a fundamental tool in optics, science, and art."

      "question": "What does cc in engines mean ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**CC in engines = “cubic centimeters.”**  \n\nIt’s a unit of **engine displacement**—the total volume of all the cylinders in an engine, measured in cubic centimeters (cc).  \n\n- **Why it matters:**  \n  - A larger cc number means the engine can move more air/fuel per cycle, which usually translates to more power and torque.  \n  - It’s the standard way to compare engine sizes, especially in motorcycles, scooters, and small cars.  \n\n- **Typical ranges:**  \n  - 125 cc – 250 cc: small scooters or entry‑level motorcycles.  \n  - 500 cc – 750 cc: mid‑size bikes.  \n  - 1,000 cc – 1,600 cc: larger motorcycles or compact cars.  \n  - 2,000 cc+ : high‑performance cars, trucks, or large motorcycles.  \n\n- **Conversion:**  \n  - 1 L (liter) = 1,000 cc.  \n  - 1 cc ≈ 0.061 in³.  \n\nSo when you see “250 cc” or “1,600 cc,” it’s simply telling you the engine’s displacement in cubic centimeters."

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**An ulcer** is a sore that develops when the protective lining of a body surface (usually the skin or mucous membranes) breaks down, exposing the underlying tissue.  The most common type is a *peptic ulcer*, which occurs in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum).  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  What Happens in an Ulcer?\n\n| Step | What’s going on |\n|------|-----------------|\n| **Erosion of the lining** | The mucous layer that protects the tissue is damaged. |\n| **Exposure to acid or enzymes** | In the stomach/duodenum, gastric acid and digestive enzymes attack the exposed tissue. |\n| **Inflammation & pain** | The body’s immune response causes swelling and pain. |\n| **Healing or chronicity** | If the cause is removed, the ulcer can heal; otherwise it may persist or worsen. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Types of Ulcers\n\n| Type | Typical location | Common cause |\n|------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Peptic (gastric/duodenal)** | Stomach or duodenum | *Helicobacter pylori* infection, NSAID use, stress, smoking |\n| **Gastric** | Stomach lining | Same as above, plus acid hypersecretion |\n| **Duodenal** | Upper small intestine | Same as above, often occurs in the first part of the duodenum |\n| **Pressure (bed‑sores)** | Skin over bony prominences | Prolonged pressure, immobility |\n| **Venous stasis** | Lower legs | Chronic venous insufficiency |\n| **Traumatic** | Any area | Injury or surgery |\n| **Burn** | Skin | Thermal, chemical, or radiation injury |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical ulcer |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Burning abdominal pain** | Peptic ulcer (often improves or worsens with food) |\n| **Heartburn / acid reflux** | Gastric ulcer |\n| **Nausea / vomiting** | Severe ulcers |\n| **Dark or black stool** | Bleeding ulcer |\n| **Painful skin lesions** | Pressure or venous ulcers |\n| **Redness, swelling, drainage** | Traumatic or burn ulcers |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Diagnosis\n\n1. **Medical history & physical exam**  \n2. **Upper endoscopy (EGD)** – visualizes the ulcer and allows biopsy.  \n3. **Helicobacter pylori testing** – breath, stool, or blood tests.  \n4. **Imaging** – X‑ray, CT, or MRI for deeper ulcers or complications.  \n5. **Lab tests** – CBC for anemia, coagulation studies if bleeding suspected.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Treatment\n\n| Goal | Typical approach |\n|------|------------------|\n| **Reduce acid** | Proton‑pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole) or H₂ blockers (ranitidine). |\n| **Eliminate H. pylori** | Triple therapy: two antibiotics + a PPI for 10–14 days. |\n| **Stop irritants** | Discontinue NSAIDs, avoid alcohol, reduce stress. |\n| **Support healing** | Antacids, sucralfate (protective coating). |\n| **Manage pain** | NSAIDs (if safe), acetaminophen, or stronger analgesics if needed. |\n| **Treat complications** | Endoscopic clipping or cautery for bleeding; surgery for perforation or obstruction. |\n| **Pressure ulcers** | Off‑loading devices, wound care, nutrition, infection control. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Prevention\n\n- **Avoid unnecessary NSAIDs** or use protective agents (e.g., PPI) if needed.  \n- **Treat H. pylori** promptly if diagnosed.  \n- **Manage stress** and maintain a healthy diet.  \n- **Use proper wound care** and reposition patients to prevent pressure ulcers.  \n- **Quit smoking** and limit alcohol intake.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAn ulcer is a break in the protective lining of a body surface, most commonly the stomach or duodenum, caused by acid, infection, or irritation.  It presents with pain, possible bleeding, and requires treatment that reduces acid, eliminates infection, and protects the tissue to allow healing."

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **1. Start with a principal** | The initial amount you invest or borrow. |\n| **2. Earn interest for a period** | The interest is calculated on the principal. |\n| **3. Add the interest to the principal** | The new total (principal + interest) becomes the new base. |\n| **4. Repeat** | Interest is calculated on this larger base in the next period. |\n\nBecause the base grows each period, the amount of interest earned in later periods is larger than in earlier ones.\n\n---\n\n### Formula\n\nFor a principal \\(P\\), annual interest rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal), and \\(n\\) compounding periods per year, the amount \\(A\\) after \\(t\\) years is:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(P\\)** – initial principal  \n- **\\(r\\)** – annual nominal interest rate (e.g., 5 % → 0.05)  \n- **\\(n\\)** – number of times interest is compounded per year (e.g., 12 for monthly)  \n- **\\(t\\)** – number of years  \n\nIf interest is compounded **continuously**, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\nA = P\\,e^{rt}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(e\\) is the base of natural logarithms (~2.71828).\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you invest \\$1,000 at an annual rate of 6 % compounded quarterly for 3 years.\n\n- \\(P = 1{,}000\\)  \n- \\(r = 0.06\\)  \n- \\(n = 4\\)  \n- \\(t = 3\\)\n\n\\[\nA = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 3}\n  = 1{,}000 \\left(1 + 0.015\\right)^{12}\n  = 1{,}000 \\times 1.195618\n  \\approx \\$1{,}195.62\n\\]\n\nSo you earn about \\$195.62 in interest over 3 years.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Investments**: Compound interest turns modest savings into substantial wealth over time.  \n- **Loans**: For borrowers, compound interest can increase the total amount owed if payments are delayed.  \n- **Financial planning**: Understanding compounding helps you compare savings accounts, CDs, bonds, and loans.\n\n---\n\n### Key take‑aways\n\n1. **Interest on interest** – each period’s interest is added to the principal, so subsequent interest is calculated on a larger amount.  \n2. **Frequency matters** – the more often interest is compounded (daily, monthly, quarterly), the greater the final amount.  \n3. **Time is a powerful factor** – even a small rate can grow significantly over many years.  \n\nCompound interest is the engine behind the “time value of money” concept and is central to both investing and borrowing."

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** (in chemistry) is the mixing of atomic orbitals on the same atom to produce new, *hybrid* orbitals that are better suited for forming covalent bonds.  \nIt explains why molecules have the shapes they do and why bonds have particular angles.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why Hybridization Is Needed\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have fixed shapes and energies.  \n- In many molecules, the observed bond angles (e.g., 109.5°, 120°, 180°) don’t match the geometry of a single s or p orbital.  \n- By *mixing* orbitals, we create new orbitals that are **sp³‑like, sp²‑like, etc.**—each pointing in directions that match the observed geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The Basic Hybrid Orbitals\n\n| Hybridization | Orbitals mixed | Number of hybrid orbitals | Shape & bond angle | Typical example |\n|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | 4 | Tetrahedral, 109.5° | CH₄, NH₃, H₂O (with lone pairs) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | 3 | Trigonal planar, 120° | C₂H₄ (ethylene), BF₃ |\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | 2 | Linear, 180° | C₂H₂ (acetylene) |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal, 90°/120° | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | 6 | Octahedral, 90° | SF₆ |\n\n*Note:* The “d” orbitals are only used when the central atom is in the third period or higher.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How Hybridization Works (Simplified)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count the *electron‑pair groups* (bonding pairs + lone pairs).  \n2. **Choose the hybridization** that gives the right number of hybrid orbitals.  \n3. **Form bonds** by overlapping each hybrid orbital with a suitable orbital from a neighboring atom.  \n4. **Resulting geometry** matches the observed shape.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons: 2 s + 2 p.  \n- To form 4 C–H σ bonds, carbon uses **sp³ hybrid orbitals** (4 hybrids).  \n- Each hybrid points toward a corner of a tetrahedron → 109.5° bond angles.  \n- The molecule is perfectly tetrahedral.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Hybridization in Other Contexts (Brief)\n\n| Field | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Genetics** | Crossing of two different species or varieties to produce a hybrid. |\n| **Linguistics** | Mixing of two languages or dialects (code‑mixing). |\n| **Physics** | Mixing of quantum states (e.g., electron‑hole hybridization). |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is a conceptual tool that lets chemists explain and predict the shapes of molecules by combining atomic orbitals into new, directionally‑oriented hybrid orbitals. It’s the reason why methane is tetrahedral, ethylene is planar, and many other molecules have the geometries they do."

        "**Alcohol is absorbed very quickly—usually within minutes, with peak blood‑alcohol levels (BAC) reached in about 30–90 minutes after drinking.**  \n\n| What happens | How fast | What it means for you |\n|--------------|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Stomach absorption** | ~20–30 % of the drink is absorbed in the stomach (especially if the drink is high‑concentration or taken on an empty stomach). | If you drink a hard liquor or a concentrated cocktail, a chunk of it will jump straight into your bloodstream. |\n| **Small‑intestine absorption** | The remaining 70–80 % is absorbed in the small intestine, where the bulk of the alcohol enters the blood. | Most of the alcohol you drink ends up in the bloodstream within the first hour. |\n| **Peak BAC** | 30–90 minutes after ingestion (varies with dose, body weight, gender, food, and metabolism). | That’s the window when you’re most “drunk” and most likely to feel the effects. |\n| **Rate of absorption** | Roughly **0.1–0.2 g of alcohol per kilogram of body weight per hour** (≈ 0.015–0.02 % BAC per hour for a typical adult). | A 70‑kg person might absorb ~7–14 g of alcohol in the first hour, which translates to about 0.1–0.2 % BAC. |\n| **Factors that slow absorption** | • Food in the stomach (especially fat or protein) delays gastric emptying.<br>• Alcohol concentration (lower‑strength drinks are absorbed more slowly).<br>• Alcohol metabolism (liver enzymes) and individual genetics. | If you eat a meal before drinking, you’ll reach peak BAC later and the overall rise will be gentler. |\n\n### Quick take‑away\n\n- **Within the first 30–90 minutes** you’ll see the bulk of the alcohol in your bloodstream.  \n- **Absorption is rapid**—about 0.1–0.2 % BAC per hour for most adults.  \n- **Food, drink type, and individual metabolism** can shift that timing and rate, but the general rule is: “Alcohol gets into your blood fast, peaks in an hour or so, and then your body starts to metabolize it.”"

      "system_answer": [
        "**Poliomyelitis (polio)** is a highly infectious viral disease that attacks the nervous system, most often the motor neurons that control muscle movement. It is caused by the **polio virus (poliovirus)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family.  \n\n---\n\n## How it spreads\n- **Fecal‑oral route**: The virus is shed in the stool of infected people and can contaminate food, water, or surfaces.  \n- **Oral‑oral route**: Direct contact with saliva or respiratory secretions can also transmit the virus.  \n- **Rarely**: Airborne spread is not a major route.\n\n---\n\n## Clinical course\n| Stage | What happens | Typical symptoms |\n|-------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (can be up to 4 weeks) | Usually none |\n| **Prodromal (early)** | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, mild headache | Low‑grade fever, malaise, sore throat, sometimes a mild cough |\n| **Paralytic** | Virus invades the spinal cord and brainstem | Sudden flaccid paralysis (often asymmetric), loss of reflexes, muscle weakness, respiratory difficulty if the diaphragm is affected |\n| **Recovery** | Some regain function; others may have permanent paralysis | Variable; some recover fully, others may have residual weakness or paralysis |\n\n- **Non‑paralytic polio**: Most infections (≈ 90–95 %) are asymptomatic or cause only mild flu‑like illness.  \n- **Paralytic polio**: About 1 % of infections lead to paralysis; the rest are mild.\n\n---\n\n## Prevention\n- **Vaccination** is the cornerstone of polio control. Two main vaccines are used worldwide:\n  1. **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)** – injected, used in the U.S. and many other countries.\n  2. **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** – contains live attenuated virus, used in many low‑resource settings and in mass‑campaigns.\n\n- **Hygiene**: Handwashing, safe drinking water, and sanitation reduce transmission.\n\n---\n\n## Global status\n- **Eradication effort**: Since the 1980s, global polio incidence has dropped by > 99 %.  \n- **Endemic countries**: As of 2023, polio remains endemic only in a few countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Pakistan).  \n- **Outbreaks**: Occur when vaccination coverage drops or OPV strains revert to virulence (rare).\n\n---\n\n## Key take‑away\nPoliomyelitis is a viral disease that can cause sudden paralysis by attacking motor neurons. It is largely preventable through vaccination, and global efforts have nearly eliminated it."

      "question": "What is severance pay ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Severance pay** is a payment (or set of payments) that an employer gives to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually because the employee is laid off, terminated, or the company is restructuring. It’s intended to help the employee transition to new work while they search for a new job or adjust to a new financial situation.\n\n### Key points\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Purpose** | Provide a financial cushion during the period of unemployment or job search. |\n| **Typical form** | A lump‑sum payment, a series of regular payments (e.g., a few weeks’ salary each month), or a combination of cash and benefits (continued health insurance, outplacement services). |\n| **How it’s calculated** | Often based on length of service, position, or a set formula (e.g., one week’s pay for each year worked). The exact amount is usually specified in the employment contract, company policy, or a severance agreement. |\n| **Legal status** | Not required by federal law in the U.S. (except in certain cases, e.g., the WARN Act for large layoffs). Many states, countries, or collective bargaining agreements mandate severance or provide guidelines. |\n| **Tax treatment** | In most jurisdictions, severance pay is treated as ordinary income and is subject to withholding and payroll taxes. |\n| **Negotiation** | Employees can negotiate severance terms during a layoff or termination discussion. It’s common to ask for a longer payout period, continued benefits, or a reference letter. |\n| **Common triggers** | • Company downsizing or restructuring<br>• Plant or office closure<br>• Mergers/acquisitions<br>• Performance‑related termination (though often less generous) |\n\n### Example\n\nAn employee who has worked for a company for 10 years might receive a severance package equal to 2 weeks of pay for each year of service, plus 3 months of continued health insurance. If their weekly salary is $1,000, the severance would be:\n\n- 10 years × 2 weeks × $1,000 = $20,000 in cash\n- Plus 3 months of health‑insurance coverage\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSeverance pay is a negotiated or contractual payment that helps employees bridge the gap between jobs, providing financial support and sometimes additional benefits during a period of transition."

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Semiconductors** are materials whose ability to conduct electricity lies between that of good conductors (like copper) and insulators (like glass). Their electrical properties can be precisely controlled, which makes them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What makes a semiconductor special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | In a semiconductor, the valence band (filled with electrons) is separated from the conduction band (where electrons can move freely) by a small energy gap (≈ 0.1–4 eV). This gap can be bridged by thermal energy, light, or an applied voltage. |\n| **Doping** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (dopants) introduces extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type). This changes the material’s conductivity in a predictable way. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite to metals), because more electrons gain enough energy to cross the band gap. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Most common semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs) have a crystalline lattice that allows electrons to move in well‑defined paths, enabling high‑speed devices. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common semiconductor materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Integrated circuits, solar cells, power devices | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑frequency RF, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 2.3–3.3 |\n| **Gallium nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power amplifiers, RF | 3.4 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How semiconductors are used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) | Key semiconductor feature |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction allows current one way | p‑type + n‑type doping |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Controls current flow with a small gate/base signal | Field‑effect control, high‑speed switching |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Many transistors on one chip | Precise doping, lithography |\n| **Solar cell** | Photons excite electrons across band gap | Light‑absorbing band gap |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting light | Direct band gap (GaAs, GaN) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why semiconductors matter\n\n- **Miniaturization**: Tiny transistors (nanometers wide) allow billions of logic gates on a single chip.  \n- **Energy efficiency**: Low‑power switching reduces heat and energy consumption.  \n- **Versatility**: From microprocessors to sensors, power supplies to LEDs, semiconductors are everywhere.  \n- **Innovation driver**: Advances in semiconductor technology (e.g., Moore’s Law, 3‑D stacking, new materials) enable faster, smaller, and cheaper electronics.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity can be finely tuned by doping and external stimuli. This controllability allows them to form the core components of virtually all modern electronic devices—from smartphones and computers to solar panels and LED lighting."

        "A **thermometer** is a device that measures temperature—how hot or cold something is. It works by using a material that changes in a predictable way when its temperature changes, and that change is translated into a readable scale.\n\n### How it works (basic idea)\n\n| Step | What happens | Result |\n|------|--------------|--------|\n| 1. **Heat transfer** | The thermometer’s sensing element (e.g., mercury, alcohol, or a gas) is exposed to the object or environment whose temperature you want to measure. |\n| 2. **Physical change** | The element expands (or contracts) as it warms (or cools). |\n| 3. **Measurement** | The expansion is linked to a calibrated scale (often on a glass tube or digital display). The scale tells you the temperature. |\n\n### Common types\n\n| Type | Sensing element | Typical use |\n|------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Mercury glass thermometer** | Mercury (liquid metal) | Medical, laboratory, household (though less common now due to mercury’s toxicity) |\n| **Alcohol thermometer** | Alcohol (often dyed red) | Low‑temperature measurements, outdoor use |\n| **Digital thermometer** | Thermistor or semiconductor sensor | Quick, accurate readings in medical, kitchen, industrial settings |\n| **Infrared thermometer** | Infrared sensor | Non‑contact temperature measurement (e.g., fever screening, industrial processes) |\n| **Thermocouple** | Two different metals joined together | High‑temperature industrial processes, scientific research |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Health**: Checking body temperature for fever.  \n- **Science**: Recording temperature changes in experiments.  \n- **Industry**: Monitoring processes, ensuring safety, controlling climate.  \n- **Everyday life**: Weather forecasts, cooking, HVAC systems.\n\nIn short, a thermometer is a tool that turns the invisible property of temperature into a visible, readable number."

        "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called *hyphae*. When these hyphae branch and spread, they form a network that can be seen as a fuzzy or powdery patch on surfaces.  \n\n### Key characteristics\n\n| Feature | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Growth form** | Hyphae → mycelium (the visible “body” of the mold). |\n| **Reproduction** | Produces spores (tiny, lightweight cells) that can be carried by air, water, or contact. |\n| **Habitat** | Needs moisture, organic material, and a suitable temperature (typically 20–30 °C). Common in kitchens, bathrooms, basements, and any damp area. |\n| **Appearance** | Often green, black, white, or blue‑green; can be fuzzy, powdery, or slimy. |\n| **Health impact** | Some molds release allergens, irritants, or mycotoxins that can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions, or more serious illnesses in sensitive individuals. |\n| **Damage** | Can degrade building materials (wood, drywall, insulation) and food products. |\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Indoor air quality**: Mold spores in the air can trigger asthma, allergies, or infections.  \n- **Structural integrity**: Prolonged exposure can weaken wood, drywall, and other building components.  \n- **Food safety**: Moldy food can be unsafe to eat, especially if it produces toxins.  \n\n### Prevention & control\n\n1. **Control moisture**: Fix leaks, use dehumidifiers, ventilate bathrooms/kitchens.  \n2. **Clean promptly**: Remove visible mold with soap and water or a mold‑removal solution.  \n3. **Dispose of heavily infested items**: Some materials (carpet, drywall) may need to be replaced.  \n4. **Use protective gear**: Gloves, mask, and eye protection when cleaning mold.  \n5. **Professional help**: For large infestations or when mold is hidden behind walls or in HVAC systems.  \n\nIn short, mold is a fungus that thrives in damp, organic environments, spreads via spores, and can cause health and structural problems if not managed."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion** that accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, “mushy” texture (hence the name “spongiform”).\n\n### How it works\n- **Prions** are tiny, protein‑only infectious agents that can convert normal prion proteins in the brain into the abnormal form.\n- The abnormal proteins build up, damaging brain tissue and causing the characteristic spongy appearance.\n- The disease progresses slowly; symptoms appear after a long incubation period (often 2–4 years in cattle).\n\n### Symptoms in cattle\n- Loss of coordination (ataxia)\n- Stiffness, tremors, and difficulty walking\n- Behavioral changes (aggression, irritability)\n- Weight loss and decreased appetite\n- Eventually, the animal becomes severely disabled and dies.\n\n### Transmission\n- **Feed contamination**: The most common route in the 1980s–1990s was feeding cattle processed animal protein (including infected brain or spinal tissue) in their feed. This practice was banned in many countries.\n- **Natural spread**: Infected animals can transmit the disease to other cattle through bodily fluids, but this is less common.\n\n### Human connection\n- **Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD)**: Humans can contract a related prion disease by eating infected beef products. vCJD is rare but fatal, with symptoms such as dementia, muscle stiffness, and loss of coordination.\n- **Public health measures**: Strict regulations on cattle feed, slaughtering, and beef processing have dramatically reduced BSE cases and vCJD risk.\n\n### Global impact\n- The BSE outbreak in the 1980s–1990s caused widespread economic loss in the beef industry and led to major changes in animal husbandry and food safety regulations worldwide.\n- Today, BSE cases are extremely rare in most countries, thanks to rigorous surveillance and control programs.\n\n### Bottom line\nMad cow disease is a prion‑based, fatal brain disorder in cattle that can, in rare cases, be transmitted to humans through contaminated beef. It is a key example of how a protein alone can act as an infectious agent and how public health measures can curb a serious animal and human health threat."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Natural gas** is a fossil‑fuel gas that is extracted from underground reservoirs.  Its composition is mainly a mixture of hydrocarbons, with the exact proportions varying by field, but the typical composition is:\n\n| Component | Typical range (by volume) | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------------------|-------|\n| **Methane (CH₄)** | 70 – 90 % | The dominant component; gives natural gas its low‑density, high‑energy‑content character. |\n| **Ethane (C₂H₆)** | 5 – 15 % | Often used as a feedstock for petrochemicals. |\n| **Propane (C₃H₈)** | 1 – 5 % | Adds heating value; sometimes separated for use as LPG. |\n| **Butane (C₄H₁₀)** | 0.5 – 3 % | Also used as LPG; contributes to higher calorific value. |\n| **Pentane & heavier hydrocarbons** | < 1 % | Minor constituents; can be removed to meet pipeline specifications. |\n| **Inert gases** (neon, helium, argon, krypton, xenon) | < 1 % | Trace amounts; usually negligible. |\n| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 0 – 5 % | Often present as a contaminant; removed in processing. |\n| **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** | 0 – 5 % | Can be present; removed to meet pipeline standards. |\n| **Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)** | < 0.1 % | Toxic; must be removed for safety. |\n| **Water vapor** | Variable | Condensed water is removed during processing. |\n\n### Key points\n\n- **Methane** is the core component, providing the bulk of the energy content (≈ 55 MJ/m³).  \n- The heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane) are often separated and sold as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  \n- Inert gases and contaminants (nitrogen, CO₂, H₂S, water) are removed during natural‑gas processing to meet pipeline and end‑use specifications.  \n- The exact mix depends on the geological source (e.g., Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Middle East fields) and the processing steps applied.\n\nIn short, natural gas is primarily methane with small amounts of other hydrocarbons and trace gases, all of which are processed to produce a clean, high‑energy fuel for heating, electricity, and industrial use."

This is often described by the “lock‑and‑key” or “induced fit” model. |\n| **Regulation** | Enzyme activity can be modulated by factors such as pH, temperature, inhibitors, activators, and allosteric effectors. |\n| **Reusability** | Enzymes are not consumed in the reaction; they can catalyze many cycles. |\n| **Structure** | Most enzymes are proteins composed of one or more polypeptide chains folded into a three‑dimensional shape. The active site—where the substrate binds—often contains amino‑acid residues that participate directly in the chemistry. |\n| **Biological importance** | Enzymes drive virtually every biochemical process: digestion (proteases, lipases, amylases), DNA replication (DNA polymerases), energy production (ATP synthase), signal transduction, and many others. |\n\nIn short, enzymes are the “workhorses” of metabolism, enabling life‑sustaining reactions to occur efficiently under the mild conditions of the cell."

      "system_answer": [
        "The Sun itself isn’t actually yellow—it emits **white light** (a mix of all visible wavelengths).  \nWhat makes it look yellow to us on Earth is a combination of two things:\n\n| What happens | Why it matters |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **Sun’s surface temperature** | The Sun’s photosphere is about 5,800 K. A black‑body at that temperature peaks in the yellow‑green part of the spectrum, so the Sun’s light is naturally a bit “yellowish” in color. |\n| **Atmospheric scattering** | As sunlight travels through the Earth’s atmosphere, shorter‑wavelength blue light is scattered in all directions by air molecules (Rayleigh scattering). The blue component is removed from the direct beam that reaches our eyes, leaving a beam that is richer in yellow‑green wavelengths. |\n| **Viewing angle** | At sunrise or sunset the light passes through more atmosphere, scattering even more blue light and making the Sun appear orange‑red. At noon, when the Sun is high, the scattering is less, so the Sun looks more white‑yellow. |\n\nSo the Sun looks yellow because its own spectrum is slightly yellow‑green and because the Earth’s atmosphere preferentially scatters away the blue light that would otherwise make it look white."

There are seven serotypes (O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, and Asia 1). |\n| **Transmission** | Direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, or even people and vehicles that have touched infected material. The virus can survive in the environment for weeks to months, especially in cooler, moist conditions. |\n| **Clinical signs** | • Fever (often 1–3 days before lesions appear) <br>• Painful vesicles (blisters) that rupture into ulcers on the mouth, tongue, and inside the lips (hence “mouth”) <br>• Vesicles on the feet, hooves, teats, and sometimes the udder (hence “foot”) <br>• Lameness, reduced appetite, and decreased milk production. <br>• In young animals, the disease can be severe and may lead to death. |\n| **Economic impact** | Losses arise from: <br>– Reduced weight gain, milk yield, and reproductive performance <br>– Trade restrictions (countries often ban imports from FMD‑affected areas) <br>– Costs of vaccination, culling, and biosecurity measures. |\n| **Control & prevention** | • Strict biosecurity: quarantine, disinfection, controlled movement of animals and equipment. <br>• Vaccination (live‑attenuated or inactivated vaccines) is common in many countries, but vaccination alone does not prevent spread. <br>• Rapid detection and reporting, followed by culling of infected and exposed animals, is the most effective way to stop an outbreak. |\n| **Human health** | FMD is **not** transmissible to humans. Humans can become infected only by handling infected animals or contaminated materials, but the virus does not cause disease in people. |\n\nIn short, foot‑and‑mouth disease is a viral infection that causes painful blisters on the feet and mouth of cloven‑hooved animals, leading to significant economic losses in the livestock industry."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Sonar** (short for *Sound Navigation And Ranging*) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater (or in other media). It works by emitting a pulse of sound, then listening for the echo that bounces back from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the echo to return and the characteristics of the returned signal, a sonar system can determine the distance, size, shape, and sometimes the material of the target.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Principle** | Sound travels through a medium (water, air, ice). When a sound pulse hits an object, part of the energy is reflected back. The sonar receiver captures this echo. |\n| **Types** | • **Active sonar** – emits a pulse and listens for echoes (used in navigation, depth sounding, fish‑finding, submarine detection). <br>• **Passive sonar** – only listens for sounds produced by other objects (used for submarine detection, marine mammal monitoring). |\n| **Applications** | • Maritime navigation and depth measurement (bathymetry). <br>• Search and rescue, locating submerged objects or people. <br>• Military: submarine detection, mine detection, underwater surveillance. <br>• Fisheries: locating schools of fish. <br>• Scientific research: mapping ocean floors, studying marine life. |\n| **How it works** | 1. **Transducer** emits a sound pulse (usually in the kilohertz range). <br>2. The pulse travels through water. <br>3. When it encounters an object, part of the sound is reflected back. <br>4. The transducer receives the echo. <br>5. The system calculates distance: \\( \\text{distance} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{speed of sound} \\times \\text{time delay} \\). |\n| **Speed of sound** | In seawater, about 1,500 m/s (varies with temperature, salinity, depth). |\n| **Resolution** | Depends on pulse frequency and bandwidth: higher frequencies give finer detail but attenuate more quickly. |\n\nIn essence, sonar is the underwater equivalent of radar, using sound instead of radio waves to “see” where sight is limited."

      "question": "What is fibromyalgia ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain and tenderness throughout the body, often accompanied by a range of other symptoms. It is not a single disease but a syndrome—meaning it’s a collection of signs and symptoms that tend to occur together.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Features\n\n| Symptom | Typical Presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Widespread pain** | Pain in at least 4 of 5 body regions (neck, shoulders, chest, abdomen, hips) that lasts >3 months. |\n| **Tender points** | 18 specific spots (e.g., neck, shoulder blades, elbows, knees) that are painful when pressed. |\n| **Fatigue** | Feeling exhausted even after a full night’s sleep. |\n| **Sleep disturbances** | Trouble falling or staying asleep; non‑refreshing sleep. |\n| **Cognitive “fog”** | Trouble concentrating, memory lapses. |\n| **Mood changes** | Anxiety, depression, irritability. |\n| **Other symptoms** | Headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint pain, numbness/tingling. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How It’s Diagnosed\n\n1. **Medical history & physical exam** – to rule out other causes of pain (e.g., arthritis, infections).  \n2. **Tender‑point exam** – pressing on the 18 standard points; pain ≥4/10 is considered positive.  \n3. **Criteria** – The most widely used are the 2010/2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which combine pain severity, widespread pain index, and symptom severity score.  \n4. **Exclusion** – Blood tests, imaging, or other labs are done to exclude other conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What Causes It?\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but several factors are thought to contribute:\n\n| Factor | How it may play a role |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **Central nervous system (CNS) sensitization** | The brain and spinal cord amplify pain signals. |\n| **Genetics** | Family history increases risk. |\n| **Stress & trauma** | Physical injury, emotional stress, or childhood trauma can trigger or worsen symptoms. |\n| **Sleep disruption** | Poor sleep can heighten pain sensitivity. |\n| **Hormonal changes** | Many patients are women of childbearing age; hormonal fluctuations may influence pain perception. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment & Management\n\n| Approach | What it involves |\n|----------|------------------|\n| **Medications** | • **Pain relievers** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs) <br>• **Antidepressants** (duloxetine, milnacipran) to reduce pain and improve mood <br>• **Anticonvulsants** (gabapentin, pregabalin) for neuropathic pain |\n| **Physical therapy** | Low‑impact exercise, stretching, and strength training to improve mobility and reduce pain. |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | • Regular aerobic exercise (walking, swimming) <br>• Sleep hygiene (consistent bedtime, dark room) <br>• Stress‑reduction techniques (yoga, meditation, CBT) |\n| **Complementary therapies** | Acupuncture, massage, tai chi, or biofeedback may help some patients. |\n| **Support groups & counseling** | Peer support and psychotherapy can address depression/anxiety and coping strategies. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Living with Fibromyalgia\n\n- **Track symptoms**: Keep a pain diary to identify triggers (foods, stress, weather).  \n- **Set realistic goals**: Small, achievable steps in exercise or daily tasks.  \n- **Communicate with healthcare providers**: Share changes in pain, sleep, or mood.  \n- **Seek multidisciplinary care**: Rheumatologists, pain specialists, physical therapists, and mental‑health professionals often work together.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic, multisystem syndrome characterized by widespread pain, tenderness, fatigue, and a host of other symptoms. While the exact cause remains unclear, it is believed to involve heightened pain sensitivity in the central nervous system, genetics, and environmental triggers. Management is usually multimodal—combining medication, exercise, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and supportive care—to help patients regain function and improve quality of life."

        "**Legally blind** is a legal definition used by governments, insurance companies, and disability programs to determine eligibility for benefits, services, and accommodations.  \nThe exact criteria vary by country, but the most common standard (U.S. and many other jurisdictions) is:\n\n| Criterion | Threshold | What it means |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Visual acuity** | **20/200 or worse** in the better eye, even with the best possible correction (glasses or contact lenses). | You can see at 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see at 200 ft. |\n| **Visual field** | **Less than 20°** (or 10° in some states) in the better eye, even with correction. | Your “cone of vision” is narrowed to a small area. |\n\nIf **either** of these conditions is met, a person is considered legally blind.  \nIn practice:\n\n1. **Best-corrected visual acuity** is measured with a Snellen chart.  \n2. **Visual field** is tested with a perimeter (e.g., Humphrey or Goldmann).  \n3. If the better eye meets the acuity or field threshold, the person is legally blind, regardless of the other eye’s status.\n\n### Why the two measures?\n\n- **Acute vision loss** (e.g., cataract, macular degeneration) can reduce acuity but leave the field intact.  \n- **Peripheral vision loss** (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma) can narrow the field while preserving central acuity.\n\n### Other countries\n\n| Country | Typical legal blindness threshold |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Canada** | 20/200 or a visual field < 20° in the better eye. |\n| **UK** | 6/60 (20/200) or a visual field < 20° in the better eye. |\n| **Australia** | 6/60 or a visual field < 20° in the better eye. |\n| **India** | 20/200 or a visual field < 20° in the better eye. |\n| **EU** | Varies by member state; many use 20/200 or 6/60. |\n\n### Practical implications\n\n- **Disability benefits** (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance in the U.S.) require meeting the legal blindness standard.  \n- **Accessibility accommodations** (e.g., large‑print materials, screen‑reader software) are often mandated for legally blind individuals.  \n- **Driving restrictions**: Many states prohibit driving for those who are legally blind, though some allow it with special permits if the visual field is adequate.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA person is legally blind if, with the best possible correction, their visual acuity in the better eye is 20/200 or worse, **or** their visual field in the better eye is less than 20°.

        "**Speed of sound** – the speed at which a pressure wave travels through a medium – depends on the medium’s density and elasticity.  \nHere are the most common values:\n\n| Medium | Speed (≈) | Conditions |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| **Air (at sea level, 20 °C)** | **343 m s⁻¹** (≈ 1 125 ft s⁻¹) | Dry, 1 atm pressure |\n| **Air (0 °C)** | 331 m s⁻¹ | |\n| **Air (30 °C)** | 349 m s⁻¹ | |\n| **Water (20 °C)** | **1 482 m s⁻¹** | |\n| **Freshwater (0 °C)** | 1 410 m s⁻¹ | |\n| **Seawater (20 °C, 35 ppt salinity)** | 1 497 m s⁻¹ | |\n| **Steel (room temp)** | **≈ 5 120 m s⁻¹** | |\n| **Aluminum** | 5 120 m s⁻¹ | |\n\n### Why it changes\n- **Temperature**: In gases, speed ∝ √T (Kelvin).  \n- **Density & Elasticity**: In solids and liquids, speed ∝ √(elastic modulus / density).  \n- **Humidity**: Adds a small effect in air (≈ +1 m s⁻¹ per 10 % RH at 20 °C).  \n- **Pressure**: For gases, speed is essentially independent of pressure (at constant temperature).  \n\n### Quick formula for air\n\\[\nv \\approx 331.3 \\; \\text{m s}^{-1} + 0.606 \\; \\text{m s}^{-1}\\,^\\circ\\text{C}\n\\]\n(Use °C for temperature.)\n\nSo, in everyday conditions, sound travels about **343 m/s** in air, roughly **1 000 ft/s**, and is much faster in water and solids."

      "system_answer": [
        "**CC** in an engine stands for **cubic centimeters**—the unit used to express the engine’s *displacement* (the total volume of all the cylinders).  \n\n| What it means | How it’s used |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| **Engine displacement** | The sum of the volumes swept by all pistons as they move from top dead center (TDC) to bottom dead center (BDC). |\n| **Unit** | 1 cc = 1 cm³ (≈ 0.061 in³). |\n| **Typical values** | 1 cc ≈ 0.001 L. So a 1,600 cc engine is 1.6 L. |\n| **Why it matters** | Larger displacement usually allows more air‑fuel mixture to be combusted per cycle, which can produce more power (though efficiency, turbocharging, and design also matter). |\n| **Common naming** | “1.6‑liter” ≈ 1,600 cc, “2.0‑liter” ≈ 2,000 cc, etc. |\n\n**Quick conversion**  \n- 1 L = 1,000 cc  \n- 1 cc = 0.001 L  \n\nSo when you see a car listed as “2,500 cc” or “2.5 L,” it’s the same engine size expressed in different units."

      "question": "What is an ulcer ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**An ulcer** is a break or sore that develops in the lining of an organ—most commonly the stomach, small intestine, or esophagus—where the protective mucous layer is damaged and the underlying tissue is exposed to stomach acid, digestive enzymes, or other irritants.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Types of Ulcers\n\n| Organ | Typical name | Common cause |\n|-------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Stomach** | *Peptic ulcer* (gastric ulcer) | *Helicobacter pylori* infection, NSAID use, stress, smoking |\n| **Upper small intestine** | *Duodenal ulcer* | Same as above; often occurs in the first part of the duodenum |\n| **Esophagus** | *Esophageal ulcer* | Acid reflux (GERD), alcohol, smoking, certain medications |\n| **Other** | *Gastric or duodenal ulcers* can also occur in the colon or rectum (rare) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How an Ulcer Forms\n\n1. **Protective barrier** – The stomach lining secretes mucus and bicarbonate to neutralize acid and protect the epithelium.  \n2. **Disruption** – When the barrier is weakened (e.g., by *H. pylori*, NSAIDs, or excessive acid), the lining is exposed.  \n3. **Erosion** – Acid and digestive enzymes digest the tissue, creating a crater or sore.  \n4. **Healing** – If the underlying cause is removed, the ulcer can heal; otherwise it may persist or worsen.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Burning abdominal pain** | Often 2–3 hours after eating, relieved by food or antacids, worsens at night |\n| **Nausea or vomiting** | May contain blood (coffee‑ground vomit) |\n| **Loss of appetite** | Weight loss |\n| **Heartburn or reflux** | Burning in chest or throat |\n| **Bleeding** | Dark stools (melena) or bright red blood in stool/ vomit |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Upper endoscopy (EGD)** | Direct view of ulcer, biopsy for *H. pylori* |\n| **Urea breath test** | Detects *H. pylori* infection |\n| **Stool antigen test** | *H. pylori* presence |\n| **Blood tests** | Anemia, infection markers |\n| **Imaging** | CT or MRI if complications suspected |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Treatment\n\n| Approach | Typical regimen |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| **Antibiotics** | 2–3 drugs for 10–14 days to eradicate *H. pylori* |\n| **Proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs)** | Omeprazole, esomeprazole, etc., to reduce acid |\n| **H₂‑blockers** | Ranitidine, famotidine (alternative to PPIs) |\n| **Antacids** | Quick relief of pain |\n| **Lifestyle changes** | Avoid NSAIDs, limit alcohol, quit smoking, eat smaller meals |\n| **Surgery** | Rarely needed; for bleeding or perforated ulcers |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Prevention\n\n- **Avoid unnecessary NSAIDs** or use protective agents (e.g., PPIs) if needed.  \n- **Treat *H. pylori*** promptly if diagnosed.  \n- **Limit alcohol and smoking**.  \n- **Manage stress** and maintain a healthy diet.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAn ulcer is a painful sore in the lining of the stomach, duodenum, or esophagus caused by a breakdown of the protective mucous layer, often due to *H. pylori* infection or NSAID use. With proper diagnosis and treatment—antibiotics, acid suppression, and lifestyle changes—most ulcers heal completely."

      "question": "What is compounded interest ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Compound interest** is the interest that is earned not only on the original amount of money (the principal) but also on the interest that has already accumulated. In other words, the interest “compounds” or “grows” on itself over time.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Basic Formula\n\nFor a principal amount \\(P\\) invested at an annual interest rate \\(r\\) (expressed as a decimal) and compounded \\(n\\) times per year, the amount \\(A\\) after \\(t\\) years is\n\n\\[\nA = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(P\\)** – initial principal  \n- **\\(r\\)** – annual nominal interest rate (e.g., 5 % → 0.05)  \n- **\\(n\\)** – number of compounding periods per year (1 = yearly, 2 = semi‑annual, 4 = quarterly, 12 = monthly, 365 = daily)  \n- **\\(t\\)** – time in years  \n\nThe **interest earned** is \\(A - P\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How It Differs from Simple Interest\n\n| Feature | Simple Interest | Compound Interest |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Interest calculation** | Only on the original principal | On principal + accumulated interest |\n| **Growth pattern** | Linear | Exponential (grows faster over time) |\n| **Formula** | \\(A = P(1 + rt)\\) | \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Everyday Examples\n\n| Scenario | Compounding Frequency | Result after 5 years (5 % rate, $1,000 principal) |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Annual** | 1 | $1,276.28 |\n| **Semi‑annual** | 2 | $1,280.08 |\n| **Quarterly** | 4 | $1,282.14 |\n| **Monthly** | 12 | $1,283.36 |\n| **Daily** | 365 | $1,283.68 |\n\nNotice how more frequent compounding yields slightly more interest.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why It Matters\n\n- **Savings accounts & CDs**: Banks often compound daily or monthly, giving you a higher yield.  \n- **Loans & mortgages**: Interest can compound, increasing the total amount you repay.  \n- **Investments**: Reinvesting dividends or interest lets your portfolio grow faster.  \n- **Retirement planning**: Small, regular contributions can accumulate significantly over decades.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Take‑aways\n\n1. **Compound interest = interest on interest.**  \n2. **More frequent compounding → higher effective yield.**  \n3. **The longer the investment period, the greater the advantage of compounding.**  \n4. **Always check the compounding frequency when comparing rates.**\n\n---\n\n### Quick Example\n\nIf you invest $10,000 at 6 % per year, compounded quarterly, for 10 years:\n\n\\[\nA = 10{,}000\\left(1 + \\frac{0.06}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 10}\n  = 10{,}000(1.015)^{40}\n  \\approx 10{,}000 \\times 1.26824\n  = \\$12{,}682.40\n\\]\n\nYou earn about **$2,682** in interest, thanks to compounding."

      "question": "What is hybridization ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Hybridization** is a concept in chemistry that explains how atomic orbitals mix (or “hybridize”) to form new, equivalent orbitals that better describe the geometry of covalent bonds in molecules.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Hybridization Exists\n\n- **Atomic orbitals** (s, p, d, f) have different shapes and energies.\n- In a molecule, atoms often need to form bonds that are **equally spaced** and **symmetrical** (e.g., tetrahedral, trigonal planar).\n- Pure s or p orbitals alone can’t produce the observed bond angles and shapes.\n- **Hybridization** combines orbitals of the same atom to create new orbitals that are **spatially equivalent** and have the right geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Hybridization Types\n\n| Hybridization | Number of orbitals mixed | Geometry | Example |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------|---------|\n| **sp** | 1 s + 1 p | Linear (180°) | BeCl₂, acetylene (C₂H₂) |\n| **sp²** | 1 s + 2 p | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF₃, ethene (C₂H₄) |\n| **sp³** | 1 s + 3 p | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH₄, NH₃ |\n| **sp³d** | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal (90°, 120°) | PCl₅ |\n| **sp³d²** | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral (90°) | SF₆ |\n\n> **Note:** The “d” orbitals involved in sp³d and sp³d² are usually the 3d orbitals of the central atom (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur).\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Hybridization Works (Step‑by‑Step)\n\n1. **Identify the central atom** and count the number of sigma bonds + lone pairs around it.  \n2. **Determine the hybridization** that can accommodate that number of electron domains (e.g., 4 → sp³).  \n3. **Form hybrid orbitals** by mixing the appropriate atomic orbitals.  \n4. **Use the hybrid orbitals** to form sigma bonds with neighboring atoms.  \n5. **Any remaining unhybridized orbitals** (e.g., a p orbital) can form pi bonds or remain as lone pairs.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Example: Methane (CH₄)\n\n- Carbon has 4 valence electrons: 2 s + 2 p.  \n- It forms 4 sigma bonds → needs 4 equivalent orbitals.  \n- Hybridization: **sp³** (1 s + 3 p → 4 sp³ orbitals).  \n- Each sp³ orbital overlaps with an H 1s orbital → tetrahedral geometry, 109.5° bond angles.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why It Matters\n\n- **Predicts molecular shape** (VSEPR theory).  \n- **Explains bond angles** that deviate from pure s or p orbital predictions.  \n- **Helps understand reactivity** (e.g., the presence of lone pairs or pi bonds).  \n- **Useful in organic chemistry** for describing sp, sp², sp³ carbons in alkenes, alkynes, and alkanes.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n| Electron Domains | Hybridization | Geometry | Bond Angle |\n|------------------|---------------|----------|------------|\n| 2 | sp | Linear | 180° |\n| 3 | sp² | Trigonal planar | 120° |\n| 4 | sp³ | Tetrahedral | 109.5° |\n| 5 | sp³d | Trigonal bipyramidal | 90°, 120° |\n| 6 | sp³d² | Octahedral | 90° |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nHybridization is the mixing of atomic orbitals on a single atom to produce new, equivalent orbitals that dictate the shape and bonding of molecules. It’s a cornerstone of modern chemistry for explaining why molecules look the way they do."

      "question": "How fast is alcohol absorbed ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Alcohol (ethanol) is absorbed very quickly—most of it enters the bloodstream within the first 30–60 minutes after you start drinking.**  \n\n| What you’re measuring | Typical time to reach it | What it means |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| **Peak blood‑alcohol concentration (BAC)** | 30–90 min after the first drink (or 1–2 h if you’re drinking a lot) | The highest level of alcohol in your blood; the “peak” of intoxication. |\n| **Rate of absorption** | Roughly **0.1–0.2 g of alcohol per minute** (≈ 6–12 g per hour) for a typical adult, but this is a *range* that depends on many factors. | How fast the alcohol moves from the stomach/duodenum into the bloodstream. |\n| **Time to 50 % absorption** | ~15–20 min for a single drink | About half the alcohol you consumed has already entered the blood. |\n| **Time to 90 % absorption** | ~45–60 min | Most of the alcohol is in the blood. |\n\n---\n\n## How the body absorbs alcohol\n\n1. **Stomach**  \n   * 20–30 % of a drink is absorbed directly through the stomach lining.  \n   * The presence of food slows this process (by delaying gastric emptying).\n\n2. **Small intestine**  \n   * The majority (≈ 70–80 %) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum.  \n   * The intestinal mucosa is highly vascularized, so alcohol quickly enters the bloodstream.\n\n3. **Bloodstream → Brain**  \n   * Once in the blood, alcohol crosses the blood‑brain barrier almost instantly, producing the psychoactive effects.\n\n---\n\n## Factors that change the absorption rate\n\n| Factor | Effect on absorption |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Food in the stomach** | Slows gastric emptying → slower absorption, lower peak BAC. |\n| **Alcohol concentration** | Higher‑proof drinks (e.g., spirits) reach peak BAC faster than beer or wine. |\n| **Body weight & composition** | Larger, leaner bodies dilute alcohol more, so peak BAC is lower. |\n| **Gender** | Women generally absorb alcohol more quickly and have lower blood volume, leading to higher BAC for the same amount. |\n| **Metabolism & liver function** | Faster metabolism (e.g., due to genetics or chronic drinking) can reduce peak BAC, but it doesn’t change the *absorption* speed—just the *elimination* speed. |\n| **Drinking pattern** | Rapid “binge” drinking (many drinks in a short time) overwhelms the body’s ability to metabolize, so BAC rises faster. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick “rule of thumb”\n\n- **One standard drink** (≈ 14 g of pure alcohol) → peak BAC ≈ 0.02–0.04 % in a typical adult, reached in ~30–60 min.  \n- **Elimination** (how fast the body gets rid of alcohol) is roughly **0.015 % BAC per hour** (≈ 0.3 g per hour), which is slower than absorption.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nAlcohol is absorbed rapidly—most of it is in your bloodstream within an hour of drinking. The exact speed depends on what you’re drinking, whether you’ve eaten, your body size, gender, and other individual factors. Once absorbed, the body takes about 1–2 hours to start eliminating it at a steady rate."

      "question": "What is strep throat ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Strep throat** is a bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused almost exclusively by the bacterium *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A streptococcus). It is one of the most common causes of sore throat in children and adolescents, but adults can get it too.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How it Happens\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Exposure** | You inhale or ingest the bacteria from an infected person’s droplets (coughs, sneezes, or talking). |\n| **Colonization** | The bacteria attach to the mucous membranes of the throat and begin to multiply. |\n| **Inflammation** | The immune system responds, causing redness, swelling, and pain. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical Symptoms\n\n| Symptom | Typical presentation |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Sore throat** | Sudden, severe pain, often worse when swallowing. |\n| **Fever** | Usually > 38 °C (100.4 °F). |\n| **Red, swollen tonsils** | May have white or yellow patches (exudates). |\n| **Swollen lymph nodes** | Especially in the neck. |\n| **Headache, body aches** | Common. |\n| **No cough** | Unlike viral sore throats, a cough is usually absent. |\n| **Nausea or vomiting** | Especially in children. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Diagnosis\n\n| Test | What it shows |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)** | Detects streptococcal antigens in a throat swab; results in minutes. |\n| **Throat culture** | Gold standard; confirms the presence of *S. pyogenes* and checks for antibiotic resistance. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment\n\n| Approach | Details |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Antibiotics** | Penicillin or amoxicillin are first‑line; alternatives (macrolides, cephalosporins) for penicillin‑allergic patients. |\n| **Duration** | 10 days of antibiotics to fully eradicate the bacteria and prevent complications. |\n| **Symptom relief** | Pain relievers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen), throat lozenges, warm salt‑water gargles. |\n| **Hydration & rest** | Essential for recovery. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why Treat It?\n\n- **Prevent complications** such as rheumatic fever, post‑streptococcal glomerulonephritis, or peritonsillar abscess.  \n- **Reduce transmission** to others.  \n- **Speed recovery** and reduce risk of spread in schools or workplaces.\n\n---\n\n## 6. When to Seek Care\n\n- Fever > 38 °C (100.4 °F) lasting > 24 h.  \n- Severe sore throat or difficulty swallowing.  \n- Swelling of the throat or breathing difficulty.  \n- Persistent symptoms after 48 h of home care.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nStrep throat is a bacterial throat infection caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It presents with a sudden, painful sore throat, fever, and swollen tonsils, but no cough. Diagnosis is confirmed with a rapid test or culture, and treatment with antibiotics (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) is essential to prevent complications and stop the spread."

      "question": "What is poliomyelitis ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Poliomyelitis** (often called **polio**) is a viral disease that attacks the nervous system, most commonly the motor neurons that control muscle movement. It is caused by the **polio virus (poliovirus)**, a member of the *Picornaviridae* family.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. How the Virus Spreads\n\n| Route | Details |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Fecal‑oral** | The most common route; the virus is shed in the stool of an infected person and can contaminate food or water. |\n| **Oral‑oral** | Direct contact with saliva or respiratory secretions. |\n| **Rarely** | Airborne transmission is not a major concern. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Course of the Disease\n\n| Stage | What Happens |\n|-------|--------------|\n| **Incubation** | 7–14 days (can be up to 3 weeks). |\n| **Early symptoms** | Fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. |\n| **Neurologic phase** | In ~5–10 % of cases, the virus invades the spinal cord and brainstem, causing paralysis. |\n| **Recovery** | Most people recover fully; some may have residual weakness or fatigue. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types of Polio\n\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)** | Classic polio: sudden muscle weakness or paralysis, often in the legs. |\n| **Non‑paralytic polio** | Mild flu‑like illness; no paralysis. |\n| **Chronic progressive paralysis** | Rare, long‑term weakness that worsens over months or years. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prevention\n\n| Measure | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Vaccination** | Two main vaccines: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). IPV is used in the U.S.; OPV is used in many other countries. |\n| **Hygiene** | Handwashing, safe drinking water, and sanitation reduce fecal‑oral spread. |\n| **Surveillance** | Monitoring AFP cases helps detect outbreaks early. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Treatment\n\n- **Supportive care**: Pain relief, hydration, and physical therapy.  \n- **Respiratory support**: In severe cases, mechanical ventilation may be needed.  \n- **No antiviral**: There is no specific drug that cures polio; treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Global Status\n\n- **Eradication**: Polio has been eliminated in most of the world. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has reduced cases by > 99 % since 1988.  \n- **Remaining hotspots**: As of 2023, endemic transmission remains in a few countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Pakistan).  \n- **Outbreaks**: Occasionally, polio can re‑emerge in areas with low vaccination coverage.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nPoliomyelitis is a viral infection that can cause paralysis by attacking motor neurons. It spreads mainly through contaminated food or water, is preventable with vaccination, and is treated with supportive care. Global efforts have nearly eradicated the disease, but continued vaccination and surveillance are essential to keep it from returning."

By modeling the material properties, we can infer temperature. |\n| **Heat‑flow measurements** | The amount of heat leaving the Earth’s surface (~ 47 TW) combined with models of mantle convection gives a temperature gradient that reaches the core. |\n| **Laboratory experiments** | High‑pressure, high‑temperature experiments on iron‑nickel alloys (the main component of the core) help calibrate the seismic data. |\n| **Geodynamo models** | The magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core; the required convection speeds imply a certain temperature range. |\n\n---\n\n### Why the range?\n\n- **Inner core** (solid, ~1 220 km radius) is hotter than the outer core because it is under extreme pressure (~3.5 million atmospheres).  \n- **Outer core** (liquid, ~2 200 km thick) is slightly cooler, but still around 4 000 °C to 5 000 °C.  \n- The exact value depends on assumptions about the core’s composition (e.g., how much sulfur or silicon is present) and the thermal conductivity of iron at those pressures.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference\n\n| Layer | Approximate temperature |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| Inner core (solid) | 5 500 – 7 000 °C |\n| Outer core (liquid) | 4 000 – 5 000 °C |\n| Lower mantle | ~1 800 – 3 000 °C |\n| Upper mantle | ~500 – 1 200 °C |\n| Crust | ~0 – 1 200 °C (at depth) |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The Earth’s core is scorching—roughly the same temperature as the surface of the Sun—yet it remains solid in the inner core because of the crushing pressure."

      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar wind** is a continuous stream of charged particles—primarily electrons and protons—ejected from the outer layers of the Sun (the corona). It flows outward through the entire solar system at speeds ranging from about 300 km/s (slow wind) to over 800 km/s (fast wind).  \n\n---\n\n### How it’s produced\n\n1. **Solar corona** – The Sun’s outer atmosphere is extremely hot (≈ 1–3 million K).  \n2. **Thermal pressure** – At these temperatures, the gas pressure exceeds the Sun’s gravitational pull.  \n3. **Escape** – The plasma overcomes gravity and streams out into space, forming the solar wind.\n\n---\n\n### Key properties\n\n| Property | Typical value |\n|----------|---------------|\n| **Composition** | ~ 95 % protons (hydrogen nuclei), ~ 4 % electrons, ~ 1 % alpha particles (helium nuclei) and trace heavier ions. |\n| **Speed** | 300–800 km/s (average ~ 400 km/s). |\n| **Density** | ~ 5–10 particles/cm³ near Earth. |\n| **Temperature** | 1–3 million K (though the particles are “cold” in terms of kinetic energy relative to their speed). |\n| **Magnetic field** | Carries the Sun’s magnetic field outward, forming the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). |\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Effect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Space weather** | Interactions with Earth’s magnetosphere can trigger auroras, disturb satellites, and affect power grids. |\n| **Heliosphere** | The solar wind creates the heliosphere—a bubble of solar plasma that shields the solar system from interstellar material. |\n| **Planetary atmospheres** | On planets without strong magnetic fields (e.g., Mars), the solar wind can erode atmospheres over geological time. |\n| **Cosmic ray modulation** | The solar wind’s magnetic field deflects high‑energy cosmic rays, influencing radiation levels in space. |\n\n---\n\n### Observations\n\n- **In situ**: Spacecraft such as *ACE*, *Wind*, and *Parker Solar Probe* measure solar wind properties directly.  \n- **Remote sensing**: Solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers track the wind’s structure and speed.  \n- **Ground‑based**: Radio telescopes observe the effects of solar wind on the ionosphere (e.g., scintillation of GPS signals).\n\n---\n\n### Quick take‑away\n\nSolar wind is the Sun’s invisible, high‑speed plasma outflow that permeates the solar system, shaping planetary environments, driving space weather, and defining the heliosphere."

      "question": "What are solar cells ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Solar cells** (also called **photovoltaic cells**) are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity. They do this by using the **photovoltaic effect**—when photons from the sun hit a semiconductor material, they knock electrons loose, creating an electric current.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How a Solar Cell Works\n\n| Step | What Happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Absorption** | Sunlight (photons) strikes the semiconductor (usually silicon). |\n| **Electron–hole pair creation** | Each photon can excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind a “hole.” |\n| **Separation** | A built‑in electric field (created by doping the semiconductor with different elements) pushes electrons toward one side and holes toward the other. |\n| **Current flow** | When the cell is connected to an external circuit, electrons flow from the negative side to the positive side, generating a usable electric current. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Components\n\n| Component | Role |\n|-----------|------|\n| **Semiconductor** | Most common: crystalline silicon (mono‑ or poly‑crystalline). Others: thin‑film materials (CdTe, CIGS, perovskite). |\n| **Anti‑reflection coating** | Reduces reflection, letting more light enter. |\n| **Transparent conductive layer** | Allows light in while collecting charge (e.g., ITO). |\n| **Back contact** | Provides a path for electrons to exit the cell. |\n| **Encapsulation** | Protects the cell from moisture, UV, and mechanical damage. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types of Solar Cells\n\n| Type | Key Features |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Monocrystalline silicon** | Single‑crystal structure, high efficiency (~20–25 %), more expensive. |\n| **Polycrystalline silicon** | Multiple crystals, slightly lower efficiency (~15–18 %), cheaper. |\n| **Thin‑film** | Layers of semiconductor on a substrate (glass, plastic). Lower cost, flexible, lower efficiency (~10–12 %). |\n| **Perovskite** | Emerging technology, high efficiency potential (~25 %+), still in development. |\n| **Concentrated PV (CPV)** | Uses lenses or mirrors to focus sunlight onto high‑efficiency cells. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typical Applications\n\n| Application | Why Solar Cells Fit |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| **Residential rooftop panels** | Low‑profile, grid‑connected, reduces electricity bills. |\n| **Utility‑scale solar farms** | Large arrays generate megawatt‑scale power for the grid. |\n| **Portable electronics** | Small, lightweight cells power phones, chargers, or camping gear. |\n| **Spacecraft** | Solar panels provide power for satellites and space probes. |\n| **Remote/off‑grid sites** | Provide electricity where no grid exists (e.g., rural villages, remote research stations). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Advantages & Limitations\n\n| Advantage | Limitation |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Renewable & clean** | Requires sunlight; output varies with weather and time of day. |\n| **Low operating cost** | No fuel, minimal maintenance after installation. |\n| **Scalable** | From a few watts to gigawatt‑scale farms. | **Initial cost** can be high; requires space and proper orientation. |\n| **Durability** | Can last 25–30 years with minimal degradation. | **Efficiency** still below many other energy sources; research continues to improve it. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick Take‑away\n\nA **solar cell** is a semiconductor device that turns photons from sunlight into electrical current via the photovoltaic effect. By stacking many cells into panels, we can harness the Sun’s energy to power homes, businesses, and even entire communities."

        "**Severance pay** is a financial payment (or package of payments) that an employer gives to an employee when the employment relationship ends—usually because of a layoff, company restructuring, or termination that is not the employee’s fault.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Purpose** | To help the employee transition to new employment, cover living expenses, and compensate for the loss of income. |\n| **Typical triggers** | • Mass layoffs or plant closures<br>• Company downsizing or restructuring<br>• Voluntary resignation with a negotiated exit package<br>• Termination for reasons other than misconduct (e.g., redundancy) |\n| **How it’s calculated** | • **Time‑based**: e.g., one week’s pay for every year of service.<br>• **Fixed amount**: a lump sum agreed upon in an exit agreement.<br>• **Combination**: a base amount plus additional benefits (e.g., extended health insurance). |\n| **Legal requirements** | • Varies by country and state. In the U.S., there is no federal mandate for severance pay, but some states (e.g., California) require it in certain circumstances. <br>• Some countries have statutory severance rules (e.g., EU, Canada). |\n| **Taxation** | In most jurisdictions, severance pay is treated as ordinary income and is subject to income tax withholding and payroll taxes. |\n| **Other components** | • **Continuation of benefits** (health insurance, retirement contributions).<br>• **Outplacement services** (career counseling, résumé help).<br>• **Non‑compete or confidentiality clauses** that may accompany the package. |\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nIf an employee has worked for a company for 5 years and the company offers a severance package of “one week’s salary for each year of service,” the employee would receive 5 weeks’ worth of pay. If the employee’s weekly salary is $1,000, the severance would be $5,000, plus any additional benefits negotiated.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSeverance pay is a negotiated or statutory payment that helps employees bridge the gap between jobs after an involuntary or voluntary separation from a company. It is not a legal requirement everywhere, but many employers offer it as part of a fair exit strategy."

      "question": "What are semiconductors ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Semiconductors** are materials whose electrical conductivity lies between that of conductors (like copper) and insulators (like glass). They can be made to conduct electricity under certain conditions and block it under others, making them the backbone of modern electronics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Makes a Semiconductor Special?\n\n| Property | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Band gap** | Semiconductors have a small energy gap (~0.1–4 eV) between the valence band (filled with electrons) and the conduction band (empty). Electrons can be “promoted” across this gap by heat, light, or electric fields. |\n| **Doping** | Adding tiny amounts of other elements (donors or acceptors) creates extra electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type). This controllable charge carrier concentration is key to building devices. |\n| **Temperature dependence** | Conductivity increases with temperature (opposite of metals), allowing thermally activated behavior useful in sensors and switches. |\n| **Crystal structure** | Many semiconductors are crystalline (e.g., silicon, gallium arsenide). The orderly lattice allows predictable electronic behavior and high‑quality junctions. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Semiconductor Materials\n\n| Material | Typical use | Band gap (eV) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Silicon (Si)** | Microprocessors, memory chips, solar cells | 1.12 |\n| **Germanium (Ge)** | Early transistors, infrared detectors | 0.66 |\n| **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** | High‑frequency RF, LEDs, solar cells | 1.43 |\n| **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** | Power electronics, high‑temperature devices | 3.26 |\n| **Gallium Nitride (GaN)** | LEDs, power amplifiers, RF | 3.4 |\n| **Indium Phosphide (InP)** | Lasers, high‑speed photonics | 1.34 |\n| **Perovskite (e.g., MAPbI₃)** | Emerging solar cells | ~1.5 |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Semiconductors Are Used\n\n| Device | How it works (simplified) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Diode** | p‑n junction allows current in one direction. |\n| **Transistor (BJT, MOSFET)** | Acts as a switch or amplifier; controlled by a small input current or voltage. |\n| **Integrated Circuit (IC)** | Thousands to billions of transistors on a single chip, enabling CPUs, GPUs, memory, sensors, etc. |\n| **Photovoltaic cell** | Absorbs photons, creates electron–hole pairs, drives current. |\n| **LED** | Electrons recombine with holes, emitting light. |\n| **Solar cell** | Converts sunlight to electricity via the photovoltaic effect. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why Semiconductors Matter\n\n| Impact | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Digital revolution** | All modern computers, smartphones, and IoT devices rely on semiconductor chips. |\n| **Energy efficiency** | Power‑semiconductors (SiC, GaN) allow high‑voltage, high‑frequency operation with lower losses. |\n| **Renewable energy** | Solar cells and power electronics enable efficient conversion and grid integration. |\n| **Miniaturization** | Moore’s Law (doubling transistors every ~18 months) has driven smaller, faster, cheaper electronics. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Concepts in a Nutshell\n\n| Concept | Quick definition |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **Band structure** | Energy levels available to electrons in a solid. |\n| **Doping** | Introducing impurities to control carrier type and concentration. |\n| **p‑type** | Material with excess holes (positive charge carriers). |\n| **n‑type** | Material with excess electrons (negative charge carriers). |\n| **p‑n junction** | Interface between p‑type and n‑type regions; core of diodes and transistors. |\n| **MOSFET** | Metal‑Oxide‑Semiconductor Field‑Effect Transistor; most common transistor in digital ICs. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSemiconductors are materials whose conductivity can be precisely controlled by doping, temperature, and electric fields. This tunability allows them to form the essential building blocks—diodes, transistors, integrated circuits—of all modern electronic devices, from microprocessors to solar panels."

      "question": "What is mold ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Mold** is a type of fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called **hyphae**. When these hyphae branch and spread, they form a visible network or “mush” that can appear on many surfaces—walls, wood, food, fabrics, and even in the air.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Mold Grows\n\n| Factor | What Happens |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Moisture** | Mold needs water to germinate. Even a few drops of condensation can start a colony. |\n| **Temperature** | Most molds thrive between **60–80 °F (15–27 °C)**, but some can grow at cooler or warmer extremes. |\n| **Nutrients** | Mold feeds on organic matter—paper, wood, drywall, food, carpet, and even some plastics. |\n| **Airflow** | Adequate airflow helps mold spores disperse, but stagnant air can create “hot spots” of growth. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Types of Mold\n\n| Mold | Typical Appearance | Where It’s Found |\n|------|--------------------|------------------|\n| **Aspergillus** | Greenish‑brown, powdery | Damp walls, HVAC ducts, food |\n| **Cladosporium** | Dark green or black | Damp wood, carpet, HVAC |\n| **Stachybotrys (black mold)** | Dark green/black, slimy | Water‑damaged drywall, insulation |\n| **Penicillium** | Blue‑green, fuzzy | Food, damp walls, soil |\n| **Alternaria** | Dark spots, often on plants | Indoor surfaces, plants |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why Mold Matters\n\n| Issue | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Health** | Can trigger allergies, asthma, respiratory irritation, and in rare cases, toxic reactions (especially with Stachybotrys). |\n| **Structural damage** | Hyphae can break down cellulose and other organic materials, weakening wood, drywall, and insulation. |\n| **Odor** | “Musty” smell is a hallmark of mold‑infested areas. |\n| **Food safety** | Moldy food can produce mycotoxins that are harmful if ingested. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prevention & Control\n\n| Step | What to Do |\n|------|------------|\n| **Control moisture** | Fix leaks, use dehumidifiers (keep RH < 50 %), ventilate bathrooms/kitchens, ensure proper drainage. |\n| **Inspect regularly** | Check basements, attics, crawl spaces, and any damp areas for early signs. |\n| **Clean promptly** | Use soap & water or a mold‑specific cleaner for small patches. |\n| **Remove contaminated material** | Porous items (drywall, insulation, carpet) that have been moldy for > 24 h usually need disposal. |\n| **Use mold‑resistant products** | Mold‑resistant drywall, paints, and sealants in high‑humidity areas. |\n| **Maintain HVAC** | Clean filters, inspect ducts, and consider UV lights or antimicrobial coatings. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Removal (DIY vs. Professional)\n\n| Situation | Recommended Action |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| **Small patch (< 10 sq ft)** | Wear gloves, mask, eye protection; scrub with detergent or a 1:10 bleach solution; dry thoroughly. |\n| **Large area or porous material** | Professional remediation is safest; they’ll contain the spores, remove affected materials, and treat the space. |\n| **Suspected toxic mold** | Always call a certified mold inspector or remediation specialist. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick FAQ\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Can mold grow on metal?** | Rarely; it prefers organic substrates, but metal can corrode if exposed to moisture. |\n| **Is mold always black?** | No—molds come in many colors (green, blue, black, white, orange). |\n| **Do all molds produce toxins?** | Only certain species produce mycotoxins; most common household molds are not highly toxic. |\n| **Can mold be completely eliminated?** | Yes, if moisture is controlled and all contaminated material is removed or treated. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nMold is a fungus that thrives in damp, warm environments and can cause health problems and structural damage. Keeping indoor humidity low, fixing leaks, and promptly cleaning any visible growth are the best ways to prevent and control mold. If you suspect a large or toxic mold problem, professional assessment and remediation are recommended."

      "question": "What does `` Sitting Shiva '' mean ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Sitting Shiva** is a Jewish mourning practice that involves a period of close, communal grieving after a death. The term comes from the Hebrew word *shivah* (שִׁבָּה), meaning “seven.” It refers to the seven‑day mourning period that follows the burial.\n\n### Key aspects of Sitting Shiva\n\n| Element | What it means |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Duration** | Traditionally **seven days** after the burial, though the first day is often the most intense. |\n| **Location** | Usually in the home of the deceased’s family (often the mother’s house). |\n| **Participants** | Family members, close friends, and community members who come to offer condolences. |\n| **Activities** | • **Prayers** (e.g., the *Kaddish* and *El Malei Rachamim*).<br>• **Sharing memories** of the deceased.<br>• **Receiving visitors** who bring food, flowers, or condolences.<br>• **Silence and reflection**—the mourners often sit in a quiet, subdued environment. |\n| **Dress** | Mourners typically wear **black** or dark clothing. |\n| **Food** | Simple, comforting meals are prepared; the mourners may eat at the table but often keep the atmosphere subdued. |\n| **Social norms** | Visitors are expected to be respectful: no loud conversations, no jokes, and no dancing. |\n| **End of Shiva** | The final day is marked by a *farewell* or *farewell ceremony* (sometimes called *farewell to the shiva*), after which the mourners may begin to return to normal life. |\n\n### Why it’s called “Sitting”\n\nThe word *sitting* reflects the practice of **remaining in one place**—the home—rather than traveling. It’s a time of **concentration on the loss** and **support from the community**.\n\n### Cultural variations\n\n- In some communities, the shiva may last **exactly seven days**; in others, it can be extended or shortened.\n- Some families observe a **“shiva of the heart”**—a more informal, extended period of mourning that may last weeks or months.\n- The practice is most common among **Ashkenazi** Jews, but many Sephardic and Mizrahi communities also observe similar mourning customs, sometimes with different names or rituals.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nSitting Shiva is a seven‑day period of mourning in which family and friends gather at the deceased’s home to pray, share memories, and support one another as they grieve the loss. It’s a communal, contemplative time that honors the life of the departed and provides comfort to those left behind."

      "question": "What is mad cow disease ?",
      "system_answer": [
        "**Mad cow disease**—officially called **bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)**—is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle. It is caused by an abnormal, misfolded protein called a **prion** that accumulates in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a spongy, damaged tissue structure.\n\n---\n\n### How it develops\n\n| Step | What happens |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Infection** | Cattle ingest feed contaminated with prions (often from the remains of infected animals). |\n| **Prion replication** | The abnormal prion induces normal prion proteins in the animal’s brain to misfold, creating a chain reaction. |\n| **Neurodegeneration** | Accumulation of prions damages neurons, forming sponge‑like holes in the brain. |\n| **Symptoms** | Loss of coordination, abnormal behavior, weight loss, and eventually death (usually within 6–12 months). |\n\n---\n\n### Key facts\n\n| Fact | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **First identified** | 1986 in the United Kingdom. |\n| **Transmission to humans** | Rare but serious: **variant Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (vCJD)** can result from eating infected beef. |\n| **Incidence** | Since the 1990s, the number of BSE cases in cattle has dropped dramatically due to strict feed‑ban regulations. |\n| **Control measures** | • Ban on feeding cattle with animal protein (especially from ruminants). <br>• Surveillance and testing of herds. <br>• Removal and destruction of infected animals. |\n| **Symptoms in cattle** | Ataxia (loss of balance), stiffness, weight loss, and changes in temperament. |\n| **Human symptoms (vCJD)** | Rapidly progressive dementia, muscle stiffness, and eventually death within 1–2 years after onset. |\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n- **Public health**: vCJD is a fatal, incurable disease; even a single case can cause widespread concern.\n- **Economic impact**: Outbreaks lead to trade bans, loss of consumer confidence, and costly culling of herds.\n- **Scientific interest**: BSE is one of the few known prion diseases, providing insight into protein misfolding and neurodegeneration.\n\n---\n\n### Prevention & safety\n\n| Measure | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Feed bans** | Prevents cattle from ingesting contaminated protein. |\n| **Testing** | Regular blood and tissue tests for prions in herds. |\n| **Traceability** | Tracking of cattle from birth to slaughter to ensure safe meat supply. |\n| **Consumer advice** | Cook beef thoroughly; avoid consuming high‑risk tissues (brain, spinal cord). |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Mad cow disease (BSE) is a prion‑induced brain disorder in cattle that can, in rare cases, transmit to humans as vCJD. It is fatal, has no cure, and is controlled mainly through strict feed regulations, surveillance, and culling of infected animals."

Some fields (e.g., “sweet” gas) have very low H₂S and CO₂, while others (“sour” gas) contain higher amounts of these contaminants and require more extensive processing.\n\nIn short, natural gas is **primarily methane** with smaller amounts of ethane, propane, butane, nitrogen, CO₂, and trace heavier hydrocarbons."
