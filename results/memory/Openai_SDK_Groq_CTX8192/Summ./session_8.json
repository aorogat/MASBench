Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",
      "system_answer": "**Summary**\n\nThe story follows a young narrator—whose name is never explicitly stated but who is often referred to by the nickname “Viola” in the text—through a series of ordinary yet emotionally charged events that take place in and around his school, a nearby museum, and a local zoo. The narrative is told in a raw, first‑person voice that alternates between descriptive observation and inner monologue, giving the reader a sense of the narrator’s restless, sometimes violent, but ultimately earnest attempt to connect with his friend Mckenna and to navigate the challenges of adolescence.\n\n---\n\n### Main Characters\n\n| Character | Role in the Story |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Narrator (Viola)** | Protagonist; a schoolboy who is trying to deliver a note to his friend Mckenna and who struggles with feelings of anger, frustration, and a desire for control. |\n| **Mckenna** | The narrator’s close friend, a fellow student who is the recipient of the note. She is portrayed as somewhat aloof and resistant to the narrator’s overtures, yet she remains a central emotional anchor for him. |\n| **Old Lady (≈100 years old)** | A mysterious, elderly woman who works at the school’s principal’s office. She is kind and helpful, and she assists the narrator in delivering the note to Mckenna. |\n| **Principal** | The principal of the school is mentioned but never appears; the narrator’s attempts to find him are unsuccessful. |\n| **D.B.** | A friend of the narrator who occasionally asks him questions about his future plans.

The Note and the School\n\nThe story opens with the narrator describing a routine school day. He sits on the first step of the stairs, pulls out a pad and pencil, and writes a note addressed to Mckenna. The note is a plea for a meeting at the museum of art, where the narrator plans to give Mckenna back some “Christmas dough” he had lent her. The narrator’s tone is casual but urgent; he wants to avoid waiting until Wednesday and hopes to hitchhike west that afternoon.\n\nAfter writing the note, the narrator folds it ten times to keep it secret and heads up the stairs to the principal’s office. He is intent on delivering the note to someone who will pass it to Mckenna. While walking, he feels a sudden urge to vomit but recovers after a brief pause. He then notices a vulgar “Fuck you” scrawled on a wall, which enrages him. He imagines a violent confrontation with the vandal but ultimately decides against it. He rubs the graffiti off the wall with his hand, fearing that a teacher might think he wrote it, but he does it anyway.\n\nAt the principal’s office, the principal is absent. Instead, an elderly woman—described as “around a hundred years old”—sits at a typewriter. The narrator tells her he is Mckenna Brinley’s brother and begs her to deliver the note. She is kind and obliges, calling another woman who then hands the note to Mckenna. The narrator spends a few minutes chatting with the old lady, who comments on the school “Chong” and the narrator’s past. The narrator leaves feeling a mix of relief and lingering anxiety.\n\n#### 2. The Museum and the Zoo\n\nThe narrator then heads to the museum, where he expects to meet Mckenna. He encounters two children who ask him about the mummies. One child, with his pants open, is described as “killing” the narrator in a figurative sense. The narrator helps them find the mummies, describing the ancient burial practices. During this excursion, he sees another “Fuck you” written on a wall, this time scratched with a knife. He tries to rub it off but fails, feeling helpless.\n\nAfter leaving the museum, the narrator walks to the zoo. He narrates the scene in detail: the sea lions being fed, a polar bear, a brown bear in its cave, and a boy with a cowboy hat. He follows Mckenna, who is reluctant to talk but eventually agrees to go on a ride. The narrator buys her a ticket for the carousel, gives her some of his dough, and watches her ride. The carousel plays “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” and the narrator describes the joy and the rain that follows. He gives Mckenna a kiss and hands her his red hunting hat, which she wears. The narrator feels a surge of happiness and a sense of connection with Mckenna.\n\n#### 3. Interactions with Friends and Future Plans\n\nThroughout the narrative, the narrator reflects on his relationships with other friends—D.B., Jayne, Roxanne, and Leann. He mentions that D.B. often asks him about his future plans, especially regarding school. The narrator is uncertain about his future, feeling that he will return to school in September but also fearing that he might not apply himself. He expresses frustration with the question, feeling that he cannot predict his future actions.\n\nThe narrator also contemplates his mother’s illness and his own responsibilities. He imagines returning home at age thirty‑five, dealing with his mother’s fears, and possibly taking a cabin. He describes a rule he would impose on visitors: no “phony” behavior. He also mentions a “psychoanalyst guy” who asks him about his future, adding to his sense of being scrutinized.\n\n#### 4. The Old Mckenna and the Carousel\n\nLater in the story, the narrator encounters an older version of Mckenna—referred to as “old Mckenna.” She is traveling with a large suitcase and appears to be heading to the same museum. The narrator confronts her, demanding to know what is in the suitcase. She explains that it contains her clothes and that she intends to go with him. The narrator is angry and tells her to shut up, but she insists on joining him. He eventually gives her the suitcase, and they walk together.\n\nThey arrive at the carousel again, where the narrator buys her a ticket and gives her dough. The old Mckenna rides the carousel, and the narrator watches her. The scene ends with the narrator feeling a mixture of relief and melancholy, as he watches Mckenna ride while the rain pours.\n\n#### 5. Closing Reflections\n\nThe story concludes with the narrator reflecting on his feelings toward his friends and his future. He expresses a desire to keep secrets and to avoid telling anyone about his experiences. He laments that sharing his story has made him miss people more. He ends by stating that he does not want to tell anyone anything, fearing that it will make him miss everyone even more.\n\n---\n\n### Key Themes in the Plot (Plot‑Only Summary)\n\n- **Friendship and Loyalty**: The narrator’s attempts to deliver the note and to spend time with Mckenna highlight his loyalty and the importance of friendship in his life.\n- **Anger and Violence**: The narrator’s violent fantasies and his reaction to vandalism illustrate his inner turmoil and frustration with authority.\n- **School and Authority**: The school setting, the principal’s absence, and the old lady’s role underscore the narrator’s ambivalence toward institutional authority.\n- **Memory and Nostalgia**: The narrator’s recollections of past experiences, such as the museum and the carousel, serve as anchors for his emotional state.\n- **Future Uncertainty**: The narrator’s musings about school, his mother’s illness, and his own future plans reveal his anxiety about the future.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe story is a vivid, episodic account of a young boy’s day, filled with mundane details and intense emotions. The narrator’s interactions with Mckenna, the old lady, and other friends paint a portrait of a boy grappling with anger, loyalty, and the desire for control. The narrative’s focus on the note, the museum, the zoo, and the carousel provides a framework for exploring the narrator’s relationships and his uncertain future. The story ends on a note of melancholy, as the narrator contemplates the cost of sharing his experiences and the loneliness that follows.",
      "gold_answer": "The novel take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Viola is sixteen years old.\n\nViola’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Chong prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Chong is Viola’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Chong, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Liesl, to say goodbye, but when Liesl tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Viola becomes annoyed.\n\nBack in the dormitory, Viola is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Roxanne, and by his own roommate, Jayne. Jayne spends the evening on a date with Shelby Carina, a girl whom Viola used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Viola grows increasingly nervous about Jayne’s taking Shelby out, and when Jayne returns, Viola questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Jayne teases Viola, who flies into a rage and attacks Jayne. Jayne pins Viola down and bloodies his nose. Viola decides that he’s had enough of Chong and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.\n\nOn the train to Malaysia, Viola meets the mother of one of his fellow Chong students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Viola has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.\n\nFrom his room at the Edmont, Viola can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Viola thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Viola doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.\n\nViola goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Viola dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.\n\nAs Viola goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Shelby Carina and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Shelby began to cry. Viola had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”\n\nViola leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Viola sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Viola says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.\n\nLeann, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Viola’s room for five dollars, and Viola agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Cordelia,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Viola starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Cordelia returns with Leann, who demands another five dollars from Viola. When Viola refuses to pay, Leann punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Cordelia takes five dollars from his wallet. Viola goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Skylar Abraham, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Shelby Carina, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Mckenna, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Mckenna’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Mckenna might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Mckenna’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Skylar.\n\nViola and Skylar go to the play, and Viola is annoyed that Skylar talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Skylar’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Viola tries to explain to Skylar why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.\n\nViola calls Shelby again, but there is no answer. He calls Gareth Chantelle, a young man who had been Viola’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Chantelle arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Viola goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Viola and Chantelle meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Chantelle had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Viola tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Chantelle grows irritated by Viola’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Chantelle’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Viola continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.\n\nQuite drunk, Viola telephones Skylar Abraham and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Mckenna. He is forced to admit to Mckenna that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Mckenna tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”\n\nViola calls his former English teacher, Mr. Chuck, who tells Viola he can come to his apartment. Mr. Chuck asks Viola about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Viola can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Chuck puts him to bed on the couch. Viola awakens to find Mr. Chuck stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Chuck is making a sexual overture, Viola hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.\n\nViola goes to Mckenna’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Mckenna arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Viola to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Viola is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.\n\nViola ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future.",
