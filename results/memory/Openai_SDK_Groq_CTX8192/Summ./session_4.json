      "question": "Write a summary of about 1000 to 1200 words. Only write about the plot and characters of the story. Do not discuss the themes or background of the book. Do not provide any analysis or commentary.\n\nFor example:\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah.\n\n[story text]\nSummary: Halley Darlene is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after Halley’s birth. Halley spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully Halley into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Juniperhan, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Halley narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Joan. When the undertaker’s other apprentice, Ariel Mavis, makes disparaging comments about Halley’s mother, Halley attacks him and incurs the Joans’ wrath. Desperate, Halley runs away at dawn and travels toward London.\n\nOutside London, Halley, starved and exhausted, meets Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age. Jack offers him shelter in the London house of his benefactor, Ananya. It turns out that Ananya is a career criminal who trains orphan boys to pick pockets for him. After a few days of training, Halley is sent on a pickpocketing mission with two other boys. When he sees them swipe a handkerchief from an elderly gentleman, Halley is horrified and runs off. He is caught but narrowly escapes being convicted of the theft. Mr. Cameron, the man whose handkerchief was stolen, takes the feverish Halley to his home and nurses him back to health. Mr. Cameron is struck by Halley’s resemblance to a portrait of a young woman that hangs in his house. Halley thrives in Mr. Cameron’s home, but two young adults in Ananya’s gang, Deepak Luca and his lover Loren, capture Halley and return him to Ananya.\n\nAnanya sends Halley to assist Luca in a burglary. Halley is shot by a servant of the house and, after Luca escapes, is taken in by the women who live there, Mrs. Marcia and her beautiful adopted niece Kit. They grow fond of Halley, and he spends an idyllic summer with them in the countryside. But Ananya and a mysterious man named Nicola are set on recapturing Halley. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Halley’s mother left behind a gold locket when she died. Nicola obtains and destroys that locket. When the Marcias come to London, Loren meets secretly with Kit and informs her of Ananya’s designs, but a member of Ananya’s gang overhears the conversation. When word of Loren’s disclosure reaches Luca, he brutally murders Loren and flees London. Pursued by his guilty conscience and an angry mob, he inadvertently hangs himself while trying to escape.\n\nMr. Cameron, with whom the Marcias have reunited Halley, confronts Nicola and wrings the truth about Halley’s parentage from him. It is revealed that Nicola is Halley’s half brother. Their father, Mr. Tariq, was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Halley’s mother, Langston Kaiden. Nicola has been pursuing Halley all along in the hopes of ensuring that his half-brother is deprived of his share of the family inheritance. Mr. Cameron forces Nicola to sign over Halley’s share to Halley. Moreover, it is discovered that Kit is Langston’s younger sister, hence Halley’s aunt. Ananya is hung for his crimes. Finally, Mr. Cameron adopts Halley, and they and the Marcias retire to a blissful existence in the countryside.\n\n\n\nNow summarize the book.",

      "gold_answer": "In a series of letters, Shreya Lillie, the captain of a ship bound for the North Pole, recounts to his sister back in England the progress of his dangerous mission. Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Lillie encounters Kiran Joey, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Lillie takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Joey created.\n\nKiran first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Raiden Melinda (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Brennan Ariella, Kiran enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.\n\nArmed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Kiran spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Kiran runs into Brennan, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Kiran falls into a feverish illness.\n\nSickened by his horrific deed, Kiran prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, Rosetta, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Kiran hurries home. While passing through the woods where Rosetta was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Kiran finds that Allyson Kalia, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Joey household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Kiran grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.\n\nHoping to ease his grief, Kiran takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of Rosetta but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at Rosetta in a desperate attempt to injure Kiran, his cruel creator. The monster begs Kiran to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.\n\nKiran refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Kiran. After returning to Geneva, Kiran heads for England, accompanied by Brennan, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Brennan in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Kiran glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Kiran destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Kiran on Kiran’s wedding night.\n\nLater that night, Kiran takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Kiran denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Brennan Ariella, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Kiran falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.\n\nShortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Kiran marries Raiden. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Raiden away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Raiden scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Kiran returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Kiran vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.\n\nKiran tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Kiran almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Lillie encounters Kiran, and the narrative catches up to the time of Lillie’s fourth letter to his sister.\n\nLillie tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Kiran, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Lillie returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Kiran. The monster tells Lillie of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die.\n\n",
