It is a regional variant of the broader Romanesque style, adapted to the Norman taste for solidity, monumentality, and symbolic power.\n\n| Feature | Description | Typical Examples |\n|---------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Massive stone construction** | Thick walls, heavy masonry, often using locally quarried stone. | Durham Cathedral, Caen Cathedral |\n| **Round (semi‑circular) arches** | Dominant in doorways, windows, arcades, and barrel vaults. | Tower of the Church of St. Sulpice, Caen |\n| **Large, squat towers** | Often square or round, used as defensive keeps or bell towers. | Tower of the Church of St. Mary, Caen; the White Tower of the Tower of London |\n| **Decorative arcading and blind arcades** | Repeated arches on walls, sometimes with carved capitals. | Abbey of Mont-Saint‑Michel (later additions) |\n| **Use of stone carvings** | Sculpted capitals, tympanums, and friezes depicting biblical scenes or symbolic motifs. | St. Sulpice, Paris |\n| **Limited fenestration** | Small, narrow windows to maintain wall strength; later replaced by larger openings in the Gothic transition. | St. Sulpice, Caen |\n| **Vaulting** | Barrel and groin vaults, sometimes ribbed, to support heavy roofs. | St. Sulpice, Caen |\n| **Symmetry and axial planning** | Churches often have a clear longitudinal axis, with a nave, transept, and choir. | St. Sulpice, Caen |\n| **Integration of fortification** | Many Norman churches doubled as defensive structures (e.g., fortified abbeys). | Abbey of Mont-Saint‑Michel |\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Romanesque Roots** – Norman architecture is a regional expression of Romanesque architecture, sharing its emphasis on solidity, rounded arches, and thick walls.\n2. **Cultural Fusion** – The Normans brought influences from Scandinavia, the Carolingian tradition, and the Crusader states, which appear in the decorative programs and the use of exotic materials.\n3. **Geographic Spread** – While the style originated in Normandy, it spread to England (e.g., Durham, Westminster Abbey), Ireland (e.g., St. Mary’s Cathedral, Dublin), and the Mediterranean (e.g., the Cathedral of Cefalù, Sicily).\n4. **Transition to Gothic** – By the late 12th century, the style began to incorporate pointed arches and ribbed vaults, leading into the Gothic idiom. However, many Norman churches retained their original Romanesque character.\n\nIn short, the **Norman architecture idiom** is a robust, stone‑heavy Romanesque style distinguished by round arches, massive towers, and a blend of defensive and ecclesiastical functions, reflecting the Norman emphasis on power, permanence, and religious authority.",
