It’s a high‑energy, laugh‑filled adventure that blends action, comedy, and a bit of nostalgia (the original *Jumanji* is a classic). The humor is mostly clean, with a few mild raunchy moments that most adults find fine, and the cast (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan) keeps the energy high.\n\nIf you’re looking for a few more recent comedies that should hit the same sweet spot, here’s a quick shortlist:\n\n| # | Title | Year | Why it fits |\n|---|-------|------|-------------|\n| 1 | **The Hangover Part III** | 2013 | A wild, over‑the‑top comedy that’s still fresh enough for a 40‑year‑old crowd. |\n| 2 | **Central Intelligence** | 2016 | Action‑comedy with Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Hart—great mix of laughs and thrills. |\n| 3 | **Deadpool 2** | 2018 | R‑rated but mostly clean humor; the action and irreverence make it a hit with adult audiences. |\n| 4 | **The Nice Guys** | 2016 | A buddy‑cop comedy‑thriller with sharp wit and a 70s vibe—great for a group that likes a bit of mystery. |\n| 5 | **The Grand Budapest Hotel** | 2014 | Wes Anderson’s quirky humor is a bit more cerebral, but it’s a crowd‑pleaser for those who enjoy clever jokes. |\n| 6 | **The Big Short** | 2015 | A dark comedy‑drama about the 2008 crash—funny, smart, and a bit of a conversation starter. |\n| 7 | **The Wolf of Wall Street** | 2013 | R‑rated, but the humor and energy are hard to beat for a mature audience. |\n| 8 | **The Lego Movie** | 2014 | Light‑hearted, family‑friendly, but with enough pop‑culture references to keep adults entertained. |\n\n**Quick Tips for a Movie Night:**\n\n- **Check the rating**: If you’re okay with R‑rated films, you’ll have a wider range (Deadpool, The Wolf of Wall Street).

      "system_answer": "Hey! 🎬\n\nThe 1990 *It* (the TV miniseries) is definitely worth a watch if you’re into classic horror. It’s a bit different from the 2017 film—more of a slow‑burn, atmospheric story that focuses on the kids’ friendship and the creepy clown, Pennywise. The performances are solid, and the 90s special‑effects give it a nostalgic charm. It’s a great way to see how the story was originally adapted before the big‑budget remake.\n\nIf you enjoy that vibe, you might also like:\n\n| # | Title | Year | Why it fits |\n|---|-------|------|-------------|\n| 1 | **The Shining** (1980) | A psychological horror classic with a haunting atmosphere. |\n| 2 | **The Haunting of Hill House** (2018) | A modern, character‑driven horror series that’s both spooky and emotionally resonant. |\n| 3 | **The Others** (2001) | A tense, atmospheric thriller with a great twist. |\n| 4 | **The Ring** (2002) | A supernatural horror that’s tight and creepy. |\n| 5 | **The Descent** (2005) | A claustrophobic, gore‑heavy horror set in caves—classic slasher vibes. |\n\nLet me know if you’d like more details on any of these, or if you’re looking for something else entirely!
