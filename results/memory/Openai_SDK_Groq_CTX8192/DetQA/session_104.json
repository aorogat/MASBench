      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. Samuel Kid\",\"reasoning\":\"Brinnell’s testimony indicates that on the night of the incident he saw a man he referred to as “Richard.”  In the narrative, Samuel Kid was actively impersonating the victim, Richard Nigg (also referred to as Richard Nix in some passages), as part of the murder plot.  Brinnell’s description of the person’s mannerisms and the context of the scene match Kid’s disguise rather than the actual victim or the other suspects.  Therefore, Brinnell actually saw Samuel Kid as “Richard.”\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Thomas Breen\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the murder at the Brougham (Brock’s Han) hotel is tied to the conspiracy involving Jenny Hobbs, Nancy Duane, Samuel Kid, and Richard Nix. All four of these individuals are explicitly mentioned as participants or suspects in the plot that culminated in the hotel murder. Thomas Breen, however, is never referenced in the story as a suspect, witness, or participant in the events surrounding the Brougham Hotel.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. The murderer fled in the car that he drove\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the window in Room 238 was opened as the only escape route for the conspirators. They had locked the door and hidden the key behind the tiles, so the only way to leave the room was to climb out of the window and reach the car that was waiting outside. Thus, the window was opened specifically to allow the murderer (and his accomplices) to flee in the car.\"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. Poisoned by water with a toxic substance, killed by Jenny\",\"reasoning\":\"Patrick Yves was targeted by Jenny as part of the murder plot. She lured him into drinking poisoned water, similar to how she killed Harriet and Ada. The evidence points to poisoning rather than homicide by other means.
