      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. The symbols in the envelope contain important information.\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the letter with a symbol is a crucial clue that could help identify the hidden documents and the true identity of the characters. The envelope is described as a key piece of evidence that holds encoded information (the symbols). People in black cars are likely involved in the covert operation to retrieve or protect this information, so they cut the envelope to access the symbols. The other options (money, criminal evidence, or a direct link to the British Museum) are not supported by the text.
