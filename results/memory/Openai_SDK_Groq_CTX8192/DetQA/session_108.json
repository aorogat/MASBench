      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"C. A lighter does not attract attention.\",\"reasoning\":\"The killer needed a discreet source of light that would not draw suspicion.

She used her influence and the family’s resources to manipulate the investigation, eliminate witnesses, and conceal the true motive.

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"B. The time on the watch has been adjusted\",\"reasoning\":\"The watch’s time does not match the established timeline of the crime scene. It was set to a later time after the murder, a classic method to fabricate evidence and mislead investigators.
