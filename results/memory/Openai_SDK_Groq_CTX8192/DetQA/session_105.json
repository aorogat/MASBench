      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. Extorted by Field\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative repeatedly emphasizes that Barry was forced into a desperate situation because Field was blackmailing him with sensitive documents and demanding money. Barry’s motive for murder was to eliminate Field’s threat and stop the extortion, not a work dispute, dissatisfaction with a defense outcome, or a simple debt issue.

There is no indication that he hid the hat inside the theater, enlisted staff to help, or destroyed it. Thus the correct method is that he took the hat away when leaving.\"}",

The killer wanted to transfer the blame to Morgan.\n Output:",
      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"D. The killer wanted to transfer the blame to Morgan\",\"reasoning\":\"The narrative explains that Barry fabricated an anonymous letter, posing as a message from the manager’s department, to lure Morgan into the theater. This was a deliberate deception designed to create a false lead and shift suspicion onto Morgan, thereby diverting attention from the real perpetrator. The letter was not a genuine invitation but a tool for misdirection, so the motive behind it was to transfer blame to Morgan.\"}",

Their return to the theater was driven by the need to re‑examine the crime scene and confirm the actor’s involvement, rather than merely to relive the scene or suspect staff.
