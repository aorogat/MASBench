Mrs. Hemm\nB. Mr. and Mrs. MacNamara\nC. The Brandt couple\nD. Miss House\n Output:",
      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Mrs. Hemm\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, Mrs. Hemm is explicitly named as one of the individuals who could have killed Mr. Corry (or the deceased). She is the widow of a local auctioneer and is mentioned as having said something revealing when she discovered that the dead man was not living at number 19. This direct involvement and her proximity to the victim make her the character most directly related to the death. The other options—Mr. and Mrs. MacNamara, The Brandt couple, and Miss House—are not identified in the text as having a direct connection to the victim’s death. Therefore, Mrs. Hemm is the correct choice. \"}",

      "system_answer": "{\"answer\":\"A. Mr. and Mrs. Brand\",\"reasoning\":\"In the narrative, the investigation into Quentin Ducassin’s (also referred to as Quentin Durgeslin) death points to Mrs. Brand as a key suspect. The letter from Hercule Poirot to Richard Hakast explicitly states that the prosecutor believes an arrest warrant can be issued for Mrs. Brand and that she is “the type to easily switch allegiances.” No other individual among the options is identified as a suspect or killer in the text.
