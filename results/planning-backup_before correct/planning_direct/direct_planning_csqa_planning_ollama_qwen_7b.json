However, this outcome is unlikely and would depend on the specifics of the surprise.\n\nIn conclusion, the letter that best represents the potential outcome when surprising an angry person is B (fight).

Defensive: This choice suggests that the lion is protecting itself or its territory from potential threats. Given that the lion is perceiving its competitor as timid, it's possible that the lion is adopting a subtle form of defense rather than a straightforward one.\n\nD. Aggressive: This option directly implies that the lion would actively pursue and challenge its competitor. Given that the lion has sensed its competitor's timidity, an aggressive approach may be necessary to assert dominance.\n\nE. Dauntless: This term suggests that the lion is fearless or unafraid, which can apply in situations where the lion isn't specifically choosing an aggressive attitude. However, \"dauntless\" doesn't convey a clear specific attitude like the other options.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\nD. Aggressive\n\nANSWER:\nD"
