REQUEST: category='Data' tool_name='Kick.com API | Kick API' api_name='Get Channel Details' tool_input={'channel_name': 'gmhikaru'} strip='' toolbench_key='EMPTY'
RESPONSE: {'error': '', 'response': 'The API is intended to retrieve detailed information about a messaging or communication channel based on the provided channel name. In this case, the input specifies the channel name as "gmhikaru". The expected response would include key metadata such as the unique channel identifier, creation timestamp, current status (e.g., active, archived, or pending), the number of participants or members, and any associated tags or categories. Additionally, the response might provide configuration details like notification settings, privacy level, and integration endpoints. For example, a typical output could look like: \n\n- Channel ID: 987654321\n- Name: gmhikaru\n- Status: Active\n- Created At: 2023-07-15T08:23:45Z\n- Members: 42\n- Tags: "team‑collaboration", "project‑alpha"\n- Notification Settings: Email: enabled, Push: disabled\n- Privacy: Public\n- Integration Endpoints: Webhook URL, API token\n\nIf the channel does not exist or the user lacks permission, the API would return an appropriate error message or an empty result set. This structured information allows clients to programmatically manage and display channel details within their applications.'}
